<p><font size="+1"><b>Page-based Solutions</B></FONT></P>
<p>A thin client is a type of page-based client. This means that the client is connected to the network and downloads content as required. In other words, it does not download an entire application, only pages of it.
</P>
<p>Specifically, a thin client is <i>thin</I> because it presents to the presentation tier a static information set. The user can then fill out a few text boxes, set some check boxes, and submit it for processing. This type of functionality is very similar to batch form processing from the mainframe days. The only difference is that the terminal can be anywhere on the Internet. Typically, this type of client is a Web browser. A static Web browser approach ensures that your application has the broadest support. This type of application is called a <i>browser-neutral application</I>. In this solution, the client determines the runtime environment. Typically, the runtime environment is a Web browser.</P>
<p>If more functionality is required, a dynamic Web application is needed. In this situation, a more advanced user interface is used. This makes the application more interactive. However, the cost of this interaction is that fewer Web browsers can decipher the content. For example, it&#146;s possible to develop content that will function only on Internet Explorer or only on Netscape Navigator. However, the advantage of this extra functionality is a more versatile application. Typical applications would be a Web browser-based intranet or extranet application. Usually in this situation, you&#146;ll know which browser is used.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>EXE-based Solutions</B></FONT></P>
<p>The next two types of solutions require quite a bit of functionality on the client side. These applications are executable based. This means that some application is installed on the client machine.
</P>
<p>An Internet-reliant application is one that uses a mixture of the underlying operating system and the network for content. These applications require the functionality of the operating system because of the complex tasks being processed. In this situation, the browser, which may be embedded, does not provide the richness. Instead, as in the browser-based solution, it must be connected to the Internet to receive its content. An example of this is a data warehousing application. When sifting through a data warehouse, you typically generate complex pivot tables. These tables can be graphed and compared. From that information you could make some kind of decision. Because of the graphing and complex processing involved, an operating system graphic subsystem is required. You need to be connected to the network because you don&#146;t download a data warehouse to your desktop. The processing power required would be immense.</P>
<p>The last type of rich client is one that uses only the client machine and never interacts with the Internet. The application may be a single-user application that exists on its own. These types of applications are becoming fewer and fewer. The reason is that users want to exchange information. Client applications include Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. These applications do not explicitly require the Internet, but they can be used for collaboration purposes.</P>
<p>This type of client is also breeding a new hybrid client application. The hybrid client application uses the Internet when it needs to, but it does so invisibly, without the user noticing. An example is Microsoft Money. This application is installed on the client machine and can, for the most part, exist in isolation. However, when you want to retrieve your banking statements from your bank, you must go online. An embedded browser starts up and connects to your bank. From there, it downloads your statements and displays them. During this entire process, you never type in a URL or give any network commands. The only exception is connecting to the Internet. So, in other words, the hybrid client makes seamless use of the Internet.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>The Various Technologies</B></FONT></P>
<p>For you to understand the various client types, the core technologies need to be outlined:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>HTML</I>. Hypertext Markup Language is the user interface language of the Web. When only the term HTML is mentioned, typically it is Version 3.2 or more recently Version 4.0. Both versions are a plain vanilla variety, which support forms-based processing. This technology has the broadest reach among all technologies. This technology would typically be used in the thin client.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>DHTML</I>. Dynamic HTML is the more advanced Web browser user interface. Dynamic HTML differs from HTML in that it supports a full-fledged object model. Every part of the user interface can be dynamically addressed, removed, or added. This makes the user interface incredibly powerful. However, there are fewer browsers that support this feature.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Scripting</I>. Within the DHTML object model, a scripting interface is defined. So it would seem questionable as to why scripting is considered a technology. The reason why it is considered a technology is because with scripting it is possible to control any type of client. For example, Microsoft Excel can be scripted to perform certain tasks. Scripting applies to all clients. The major benefit of scripting is that it provides application customizability, without requiring complex programming skills.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Components</I>. DHTML, scripting, and most other things on the client would not be possible without components. Not much more can be said, because most has been said.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Win32</I>. The Win32 API is a way of interacting with the operating system. This technology is appropriate for those clients that need the special graphics or high performance. The Win32 API is specific to Windows. It is not a similar programming model to HTML or Dynamic HTML.
</DL>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading8"></A><font color="#000077">Firewall Tier</FONT></H4>
<p>This tier is not directly a tier, but it is something significant that needs to be mentioned. The firewall tier is erected between the presentation tier and the business logic tier. A firewall is a security feature that ensures the data on the inside of the firewall is not compromised.
</P>
<p>It may seem that a firewall is only a service within the overall framework. This is the case in general architecture, but this is not the case with Windows DNA. Windows DNA is different from most operating systems in that it moves the security to the business logic tier.</P>
<p>There are several advantages to this setup. The first advantage is that there&#146;s a consistent security-verification mechanism. Consider the example of a castle. Using current security mechanisms, a rider could make his way into the castle anonymously. Then, depending on the service, a security verification would be required. The problem is that as the rider moves through the castle, he has to keep verifying his identity. Also, what happens if one service was not as secure as the others? A rider could become evil and cause destruction. With each service asking for identification, it&#146;s not easy to keep a consistent security policy. For example, the rider could be kicked out of one pub only. However, the rider should be kicked out of <i>all</I> pubs in the castle, but this does not happen.</P>
<p>If the firewall is the central security authority, anyone accessing any service will be known. The user will be assigned a specific set of rights and privileges, and if he abuses those rights, he can be revoked in an easy and consistent manner. In the end, this makes for a faster and simpler security framework.</P><p><br></P>
