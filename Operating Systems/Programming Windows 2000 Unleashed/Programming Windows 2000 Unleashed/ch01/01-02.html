<p><font size="+1"><b>The Guiding Principles of Windows DNA</B></FONT></P>
<p>The Windows DNA platform is a multitiered distributed application model. (I&#146;ll talk in detail about the platform in the next section.) It provides a set of services and facilities that are part of the operating system infrastructure. These services combine functionality from personal computers, mainframes, Internet, client/server, and so on.
</P>
<p>By mixing all these technologies, the operating system could be considered bloated. However, this is not the case, because you can pick and choose the services you require. You do this by picking the appropriate Windows 2000 tier and installing the required services. However, this aspect is beyond the scope of this book. Instead, this book will focus on all the services and facilities.</P>
<p>The guiding principles of Windows DNA are as follows:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Internet ready</I>. Internet technologies such as TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, and so on are integrated into the operating system. This makes it possible for applications to assume Internet availability.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Faster time to market</I>. Developing vertical applications is not simple. (A <i>vertical application</I> is one that&#146;s very customer oriented. An example is a banking application.) Solutions developed in this industry tend to be specific to the client and to the industry. In the past, vertical market software developers tended to focus on plumbing, which cost precious development time. With Windows DNA, the plumbing (system services such as transactions, messaging) is provided to the solution developer, meaning more time to focus on the application.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Interoperability</I>. Cross-platform programming is a complicated issue. There are no easy solutions. One way of achieving almost the same thing is to <i>interoperate</I>. Interoperability uses open protocols and open standards to make sure a solution will work with multiple vendors.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Less complexity</I>. Creating an installation program is not a difficult program. What is difficult and complicated is having to deal with programs that install different versions of the same program. Consider the situation of a program released in 1996 and a program released in 1999. Both programs have some shared libraries. And chances are the program in 1999 cannot cope with the 1996 shared components. Quite a few of these problems were due to the fact that operating system components were not released with the operating system. Windows 2000 solves this by integrating the services within the operating system. And future services will be released with the operating system. This will make the operating system releases and program installations easier.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Language tool independence</I>. The basis of the Windows platform is to enable third-party developers to choose their own development environment. This makes it possible for you to choose the language that will best solve the business problem.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lower total cost of ownership</I>. The last principle is to make the application simpler to deploy, manage, and iterate over time. This can be achieved by simplifying the installation and version control processes.

<h3><a name="Heading5"></A><font color="#000077">The Architecture of Windows DNA</FONT></H3>
<p>The Windows DNA architecture, which is used to build multitier applications, has three tiers (see Figure 1.1). These three tiers are Presentation, Business Logic, and Data. This architecture does not represent a physical architecture. Instead, it represents an abstract concept. It&#146;s possible for multiple physical tiers to exist within one of the abstract tiers.
</P>
<p><a name="Fig1"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/067231486x/ch01/images/01-01.jpg',165,420 )"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/067231486x/ch01/images/01-01t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/067231486x/ch01/images/01-01.jpg',165,420)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 1.1</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Windows DNA architecture.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading6"></A><font color="#000077">COM Everywhere</FONT></H4>
<p>In order for the entire architecture to work, the objects must be able to communicate with each other. This communication happens via a technology called COM (Component Object Model). COM is a vtable-based technology that makes it possible for two pieces of code to exchange information.
</P>
<p>COM is a binary technology. Figure 1.2 shows an interface, which is a vtable. This vtable is a series of function pointers to some code. The vtable definition can exist on any platform. It&#146;s generated in a platform-neutral manner. The interface then points to some implementation that performs the action. The implementation has traditionally been binary and platform specific. However, with the advent of Visual J<small>&#43;&#43;</SMALL>, this isn&#146;t necessarily the case. Visual J<small>&#43;&#43;</SMALL> generates Java code that can be executed on any platform. The only condition is that the COM runtime (implements the COM system API and system object model) must exist on the destination platform.</P>
<p><a name="Fig2"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/067231486x/ch01/images/01-02.jpg',162,420 )"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/067231486x/ch01/images/01-02t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/067231486x/ch01/images/01-02.jpg',162,420)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 1.2</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;A COM interface and implementation technique.</P>
<p>When developing Windows DNA applications, you&#146;ll most likely start with an interface definition. The interface is an intention of what it wants to achieve. An implementation will then implement intention specific to the domain. It may implement one or multiple interfaces. With a separation of the interface and implementation, it&#146;s possible for the COM runtime to dynamically query which implementation can be consumed.
</P>
<p>Windows DNA exploits COM by exposing the services as a set of COM objects. This is in contrast to previous versions of Windows NT, where the majority of services were exposed using APIs. Examples of services include security, transaction, message queuing, and hardware support.</P>
<p>So why use COM? Besides the technical reasons, COM is by far the largest component strategy currently in use. This is the reason DNA is based on COM. Breaking compatibility is not a possibility. With COM, you can build software components that can be executed and deployed on any of the tiers. The COM runtime provides support for packaging, partitioning, and other multitier issues.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading7"></A><font color="#000077">Presentation Tier</FONT></H4>
<p>The presentation tier is where the application interacts with the user. This is a necessary tier, because humans do not have the capacity to comprehend the bits and bytes on the hard disk in an efficient manner. At this tier, the data is represented in a manner that users can understand. Currently, this is largely keyboard, screen, and mouse oriented. However, this will change in the future to provide better facilities for the handicapped&#151;for example, voice and gesture facilities.
</P>
<p>In the current version of Windows DNA, the focus of the presentation tier is to promote access&#151;any time, anywhere, any how. This is made possible using Internet integration tools such as a browser and dial-up and networking facilities. This tier is challenging because the types of clients vary dramatically. In the Windows DNA architecture, the client is not just Windows based&#151;it can include UNIX, Macintosh, and other operating systems.</P>
<p>To be able to support the various platforms, the presentation tier is graded from a rich client to a thin client. Don&#146;t think of a thin client in terms of bytes to download, because a thin client may include an image that could be several hundred megabytes. The varying parameter is the amount of functionality that can be executed on the client side.</P>
<p>Figure 1.3 presents an abstraction of how to build the presentation tier. On the right side are the various technologies, represented by a series of cogs. Using these technologies, you can build two types of clients: EXE-based and page-based. These types of clients can be further divided into the four types of subclients. These four types vary from a thin client to a rich client.</P>
