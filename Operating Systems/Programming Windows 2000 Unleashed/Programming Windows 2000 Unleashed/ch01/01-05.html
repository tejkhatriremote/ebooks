<p><font size="+1"><b>Internet Services</B></FONT></P>
<p>The Internet Information Server (IIS) provides various Internet services. Included are the following:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>HTTP</I>. This is the protocol of the Web. It serves up Web pages and any content a Web browser requests.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>FTP</I>. This is the protocol used on the Internet to transfer files. It&#146;s specifically geared toward file transfer and is therefore very efficient.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>SMTP</I>. This is the protocol used to transfer mail messages from one machine to another. It can be used in conjunction with POP protocol, which is used to retrieve email.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Gopher</I>. This protocol existed in previous editions of IIS but is now obsolete. Gopher has been superseded by HTTP.
</DL>
<p>What makes IIS special with respect to other Internet servers is its integration with transactions. When a request is made to IIS, it&#146;s a transaction request. By using transactions as the basis for handling requests, you can realize all the benefits of COM&#43;. It also makes it more flexible when the transaction or business process needs to be dynamically load-balanced or optimized.
</P>
<p>To build content for IIS, you can use ISAPI (Internet Server API) or, typically, ASP (Active Server Pages). ASP technology is a scripting environment in which logic is executed from scripts. The scripting language is neutral and totally dynamic. It&#146;s used in conjunction with the COM&#43; object to provide a full-featured business application. ASP can be used to generate DHTML or XML. Although not part of Windows 2000, the process of creating ASP, DHTML, and XML applications can be handled using Visual InterDev.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Messaging Services</B></FONT></P>
<p>Asynchronous messages are handled using MSMQ (Microsoft Message Queue Server). Messaging involves a totally different way of writing code. It assumes that the connection between the client and server does not exist. It assumes that eventually the operation will be carried out. This eventuality model makes it possible for you to write applications that function over unreliable networks or in unreliable conditions.
</P>
<p>MSMQ is an event-driven architecture. The data is pushed to the server, and then the server must react to the event being called. Event-driven architecture is nothing new&#151;Windows, itself, is event driven. However, with event-driven architecture, application programming must be different from the norm, because it is an asynchronous programming model.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Interoperating with Existing Systems, Applications, and Data</B></FONT></P>
<p>Windows 2000 is not only Internet ready, it&#146;s also ready to integrate with legacy systems. Legacy systems work and do their tasks well enough; therefore, replacing these systems is not an option. Instead, they must be integrated into the overall architecture.
</P>
<p>Windows 2000 can integrate with the following legacy technologies:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>MSMQ integration</I>. Messaging integration is provided for MSMQ using various products. To connect from the Windows platform to the MQSeries product, SNA Server can be used. To connect from other platforms (UNIX, MVS, OS/2, and so on) to the MSMQ FalconMQ client, Level8 can be used.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>COM Transaction Integrator</I>. Using this interface, you can extend CICS and IMS transactions as a series of COM objects. In the COM Transaction Integrator is a series of development and business logic tools that wrap the IBM mainframe transaction. Windows SNA Server handles the communication to the IBM transaction.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Universal Data Access</I>. This layer has not yet been discussed&#151;it&#146;s known as the <i>database access layer</I>. By using native drivers, you can connect to resources that reside on the other platform&#146;s side.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>DCOM on UNIX/mainframe</I>. This is a technology that makes it possible to write COM objects on platforms other than Windows. Software AG provided the first port to Solaris. However, this has been extended to include the mainframe platform and currently extends to a full architecture called EntireX iNTegrator.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>TIP/XA transaction integration</I>. Several transaction protocol standards exist. TIP has already been discussed. Another standard is the XA protocol. Its integration is provided through a resource dispenser/manager.
</DL>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Some Final Words</B></FONT></P>
<p>The business logic tier is a very important tier. It contains, by far, the largest number of COM objects that provide specific services. This flexibility is required to build world-class enterprise applications that can receive, process, and send back data from the data tier.
