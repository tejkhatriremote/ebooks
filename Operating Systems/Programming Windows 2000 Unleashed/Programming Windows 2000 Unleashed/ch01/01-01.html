<p>This chapter will explain how Windows 2000 fits into the Windows Distributed Internet Applications Architecture (Windows DNA). The entire concept of Windows DNA can be a bit nebulous. The following note provides a nutshell definition.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B><p>Windows DNA is the realization of an operating system that exposes a various number of services and facilities that make it possible to build applications using a logical design process.
</P>
</FONT><hr>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>In this definition there are three important aspects. The first is an operating system. The operating system is a fundamental aspect of the computer system. It provides the basis of your entire framework. This operating system should be fast, stable, and scalable. The second aspect is that this operating system has a series of services and facilities. These services make it possible to do certain tasks, such as transaction processing or messaging. And finally, the operating system and services should be combined such that applications can be developed from it. And the process of application development should be a logical process.
</P>
<p>This chapter outlines what Windows DNA is and explains the various services and facilities in detail.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">History of Windows and Windows NT</FONT></H3>
<p>To understand Windows DNA, you need a context of where Windows has been. The context is important because you will be able to understand the evolution of Windows DNA. So, let&#146;s step back in time and consider the history of Windows:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Windows 3.</I>x. The Windows family began in earnest with the release of Windows 3.0. What made this version of Windows popular was the rich user interface; however, Windows 3.<i>x</I> brought something more important to the table: a common user interface and device driver model. Before Windows, device drivers had to be custom-fitted to each DOS application. This was tedious. Applications with custom drivers have custom memory requirements and customization problems. Windows changed all that and made it possible for a customer to ask for Windows device drivers. The user interface and application tasking were good as well, because they allowed for a consistent user interface for accomplishing certain tasks.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Windows NT</I>. The problem with Windows 3.<i>x</I> was its stability. Windows NT was a new operating system intended for the enterprise. In a way, it was a stable version Windows 3.<i>x</I>. It included integrated networking and server components, such as services. However, the server service aspect was not enough for writing server-side applications because it didn&#146;t provide transactions, messaging, and so on. When Windows NT was introduced, there were three versions. However, on a technical level the three different operating systems did not differ, other than client access privilege count.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Windows 95/98</I>. The Windows family kept on growing, with Windows 95 and 98 as the Windows 3.<i>x</I> replacement. Windows 95 and 98 are 32-bit operating systems. However, they differ in perspective from Windows NT. Windows 95/98 are consumer operating systems. Here, the requirement is for devices to autoconfigure themselves, making it easier to manage the client machine. This is a formidable task because there are over a hundred million machines running Windows programs. The focus for Windows 95/98 is to make it easier to navigate the Web and perform the specific tasks required of it.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>NT Option Pack</I>. Windows NT provided the foundation for a stable and scalable operating system. However, it did not provide the services required. The NT Option Pack has added that capability. The Option Pack contains the IIS, MSMQ, and MTS services, and more. This add-on marked an additional aspect of Microsoft development&#151;it marked the distinction between the independent software developer and the enterprise application developer who require these services.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Windows 2000</I>. The release of Windows 2000 brings more services and a more consistent and elegant COM&#43;. Windows 2000 is the operating system that can handle the large tasks that involve thousands of concurrent users.
</DL>
<h3><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">Windows DNA in Detail</FONT></H3>
<p>From looking at the context, the problem has been how to develop robust scalable applications. These two attributes indicate that Windows DNA is all about the server. This is incorrect, because Windows DNA is about the client, server, and any other machine. It is about a more generic solution, which can be defined as follows:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It can interact with the user via a keyboard, screen, and/or mouse.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It can potentially use other input devices, such as a touch screen and pen device, or it can even be voice activated.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It can connect to other machines via networking concepts.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It provides a reliable and consistent environment in which multiple machines can share data.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It easily manages itself and its environment.
</DL>
<p>This type of solution is a huge change in requirements from the classical Windows API era. In this era, a developer was concerned about how cool his or her user interface was and what button images to draw. This has changed because the computer has become a daily part of our lives. And, as such, it must solve more tasks and be able to interact with other machines and environments. People want things to just happen, like a toaster or microwave oven.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading4"></A><font color="#000077">The Solution</FONT></H4>
<p>Windows DNA provides a solution by having the capability to implement all the requirements using a series of services and facilities. Because the requirements seem enormous, is Windows DNA only for the corporate client? The answer is a flat no. The reason for this answer is simple. It has been shown in the past that when a strategy was only for a specific corporate size, it tended to fail. An example is EDI&#151;while being accepted by the large corporations, it is not even close to be being accepted by small corporations. Therefore, Windows DNA must address the small corporations, large corporations, and the consumer.
