<h2><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Acknowledgments</FONT></H2>
<p>As usual, there is a large number of people who deserve my heartfelt thanks.
</P>
<p>First, a big thanks to Manny Aggarwal for reminding me where I could find an operating cluster when mine broke down in the middle of writing about Microsoft Cluster Server.</P>
<p>Thanks also to Simon Brown, with whom I worked for a time while this book was in the planning stages, and who provided a great deal of help in selecting topics for this second edition. Unfortunately, I took Simon sailing just before I actually started writing and he decided to move across the country to take a job working for IBM. I&#146;m still not entirely sure if it was the prospect of a better job, or the fear of more sailing excursions that served as his primary motivating factor in moving.</P>
<p>Thanks to Shlomo Wygodny from Mutek Solutions for his help in getting me an evaluation of BugTrapper, which I think is one of the coolest tools I&#146;ve seen in years.</P>
<p>Thanks also to Bob O&#146;Brien from the Compuware NuMega Lab for his help in getting me information, evaluation products, and cool NuMega boxer shorts.</P>
<p>A big thanks to Christian Gross for writing the chapters on COM&#43; and MTS.</P>
<p>At Macmillan, thanks to Matt Purcell, Heather Talbot, Vince Mayfield, and Bart Reed. I&#146;d also like to thank Brad Jones and Chris Webb, who helped keep me on track during the writing process. Or, at least as on track as I can be while writing.</P>
