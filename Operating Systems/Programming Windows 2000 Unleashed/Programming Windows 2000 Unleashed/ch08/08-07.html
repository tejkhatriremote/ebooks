<h3><a name="Heading17"></A><font color="#000077">Using BugTrapper to Find the Cause of Crashes</FONT></H3>
<p>The biggest limitation of a Dr. Watson log is that it&#146;s a snapshot rather than a full description of the problems that led up to the fault. When debugging a fault that has resulted in a Dr. Watson log, you must give an accurate accounting of the steps that led up to the crash. However, even with accurate reporting, it can be difficult to reproduce faults that occur on different machines or configurations.
</P>
<p>BugTrapper is a product developed by Mutek Solutions that solves the shortcomings of a Dr. Watson log by recording the steps that led up to an application failure. The steps can be played back later, much like a debugging session, so that you can determine exactly how you arrived at a state that caused your application to crash.</P>
<p>BugTrapper works by modifying the binary image of your executable, so there&#146;s no need for you to modify your existing source code.</P>
<p>BugTrapper also can be used to generate reports of crashes that occur at a remote site, such as at a customer&#146;s location. The resulting log file can be sent back to you so that it can be replayed for debugging. If you&#146;ve ever had to drop everything in the middle of a development project in order to debug a problem at a remote customer site, you can appreciate a tool such as BugTrapper.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading18"></A><font color="#000077">Sources for Third-party Tools</FONT></H3>
<p>The following companies supply third-party tools for testing and debugging. Most of these companies offer limited-time demonstration versions of their products on their Web sites.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading19"></A><font color="#000077">Compuware NuMega Lab</FONT></H4>
<p>NuMega Technologies has been an innovator in advanced tools for debugging Windows applications. The original version of SoftIce was released for debugging under DOS. NuMega is now part of Compuware and sells a number of tools for the Windows developer. NuMega also has a number of tools that are suitable for use with Visual Basic and Java. You can reach NuMega on the Web at <a href="www.numega.com">www.numega.com</A>.</P>
<p>Products available from NuMega include the following:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>SoftIce</I>. As discussed earlier in this chapter, SoftIce is the ultimate debugger for Windows. If you&#146;re doing serious development work&#151;especially if you&#146;re working with services or device drivers&#151;do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of SoftIce.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>BoundsChecker</I>. This is a great tool for validating your calls to the Win32 API as well as for testing for common memory access and heap errors. BoundsChecker will detect buffer overruns, writing through invalid pointers, and releasing buffers that have already been freed.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>TrueCoverage</I>. This tool enables you to determine which parts of your code have been executed during testing. A great feature of TrueCoverage is its ability to merge coverage information from multiple users or sessions so that an entire development team can add to your coverage data.
</DL>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading20"></A><font color="#000077">Mutek Solutions Ltd.</FONT></H4>
<p>Mutek Solutions Ltd. develops products in the U.S. and Israel and has introduced BugTrapper as its first product. Evaluation copies of Mutek&#146;s products as well as whitepapers can be downloaded from its Web site at <a href="www.mutek.com">www.mutek.com</A>.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading21"></A><font color="#000077">Rational</FONT></H4>
<p>Rational Software is best known for its line of design tools, such as Rational Rose. Rational is the home of Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh, the three leaders in the field of object-oriented system design. You can reach Rational on the web at <a href="www.rational.com">www.rational.com</A>.</P>
<p>Tools for debugging and testing that are offered by Rational include the following:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Visual Test</I>. The industry-standard testing tool for Windows-based applications. Visual Test was originally developed by Microsoft and transferred to Rational a few years ago. Visual Test is a great way to use automated, hands-off testing for your applications.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Purify</I>. A tool that tests for memory problems, such as overrunning buffers, memory leaks, and invalid pointers.

<h3><a name="Heading22"></A><font color="#000077">Summary</FONT></H3>
<p>This chapter has discussed various debugging tools available to you as a Windows 2000 developer. This chapter covered some of the tools provided with Visual C<small>&#43;&#43;</SMALL> and the Platform SDK, such as the debugger that&#146;s integrated with Visual C<small>&#43;&#43;</SMALL>. This chapter also discussed some third-party debugging tools, such as SoftIce and BugTrapper.</P><p><br></P>
