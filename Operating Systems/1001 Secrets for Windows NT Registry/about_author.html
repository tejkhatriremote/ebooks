<p><big>T</BIG>o George and Mary Louise Daniels. Mom and Dad. I owe them my past, present and future!</P>
<p><big>T</BIG>o Jean Daniels, my love, my wife. Your love makes all things possible!</P>
<p><big>T</BIG>o Christopher and James Daniels, my sons. There will never be a better moment in my life than when each of you was born. I will never be as proud of anything as I am of both of you!</P>
<p><big>I</BIG> love all of you!</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE><h2><a name="Heading1"></A><font color="#000077">Acknowledgments</FONT></H2>
<p><big>T</BIG>here are many people that are responsible for this book. I have learned that as capable as we may think we are, nobody can go it alone! I would like to first thank my fellow authors: Dean Porter, who is the most technically gifted person I have ever worked with; Mark Russinovich, whose knowledge of Windows NT, Operating Systems, and vintage mid-80s video arcade games is second to none; and Steve Scoggins, whose exuberance and passion for computing is contagious.</P>
<p>I also want to thank the folks at Duke Press, <i>Windows NT Magazine</I>, and Duke Communications. First, Marion Agnew, editor extraordinaire, your incredible patience and diligence is the cornerstone of this book. Mick Gussinde-Duffy, for your faith in me and my idea, I will always be grateful to you. Steve Mitchell, who taught me what a book should be and reminded me when I strayed too far. John Morris-Reihl for taking my ugly HTML and making it beautiful and functional. Lynn Riggs, who made the manuscript look like a book, and Dawn Cyr, who tried to make it consistent. Trish McConnell, who dotted all the i&#146;s and crossed all the t&#146;s. Dave Duke, who allowed me to work at his wonderful company for over a decade. Much of what I learned about people I learned there. Mark Smith, if you hadn&#146;t listened to my silly idea about a magazine when we were both in MIS, I would have never had a chance to write this book. Bob Chronister, for your indomitable spirit and curiosity. Your guidance is and was always appreciated. You are a techie&#146;s techie. Spyros Sakellariadis, who warned me about writing a book and then convinced me to do it anyway. TJ Harty and John Bredehoeft &#151; I owe you both a latte. Dennis Agosta, Sue Chastine, Helen Kupelli, Dean Porter, Mathew Potter, Casey Tisue and Cheryl Schamel &#151; the Duke Communications MIS department. Your knowledge, support, and e-mail made it seem like I was onsite instead of miles away. Linda Jenkins, for proving that nice people often finish first instead of last. The readers of <i>Windows NT Magazine</I>, you kept me honest and never bored.</P>
<p>Tom Pokryfke, the best friend a person could ever have. The crew at the Starbucks on College &#38; Horsetooth and on Lemay. Your coffee and kindness never failed me. Jerry Tschikof, Ken DeLine, and Richard Keith of Center Partners who allowed me to use their facilities, equipment, and Internet connection. Last but not least, David Geiger, for being about as understanding a boss as anybody could hope to have. Your encouragement, witty repartee and &#147;fastball&#148; helped me through some dark hours. Now that the book is done &#133; in the words of your mentor, &#147;I will enjoy it!&#148;</P>
