<p>You have to be careful when you begin creating large number of aliases. When you run scripts from your account, some shells have the ability to inherit the variables and aliases that you might have set. You might have a script that wants to remove a series of temporary files that it created, but you have an alias to the <small>rm</SMALL> command that is set up to prompt you for every file that gets removed. If this occurs you have to go through and <i>unalias</I> all the affected commands.</P>

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading23"></A><font color="#000077">5.11.1 Description</FONT></H4>
<p>PC and MS-DOS users are often intimidated by UNIX, but there is no reason to be.
</P>
<p>Flavors: AT&T, BSD</P>
<p>The first things you should tell a DOS user are that UNIX is case sensitive, and that UNIX uses a forward slash (/) where DOS uses a backslash (\). Also suggest to them that they get an introductory book to UNIX.</P>
<p>The structure of UNIX is deeper than that of DOS, but it really can be simplified for DOS users. The basic concept of the tree structure is the same, so they should not have any problems understanding that directories and subdirectories contain files like in DOS. The large number of directories can be somewhat intimidating, but when an explanation is made of what is in /bin, /etc, /usr/local, /usr/bsd, things start to make sense to them. (After all, it made sense to us!)</P>
<p>Try to limit users to the basic DOS commands that they are used to. If you tell them that UNIX provides similar commands, just named differently or abbreviated, they usually start picking it up fast. If they are still having problems you can always set up some aliases in their startup file to make things easier for their transition:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
alias dir       ls -l                  # Display the current directory
alias copy      cp                     # Copy a file
alias rename    mv                     # Rename a file
alias del       rm                     # Delete a file
alias help      man                    # Get help
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p><font size="+1"><b>Reasons</B></FONT></P>
<p>Providing the user with enough to get them started piques their interest in UNIX.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Real World Experience</B></FONT></P>
<p>Most users making the transition to UNIX are eager to learn and make an extra effort. Programmers and engineers, however, can learn too much and could be dangerous, so watch out. Remind new users that the DOS wildcard mask <small>*.*</SMALL> is not required in UNIX; a single star (<small>*</SMALL>) will do. And unless you&#146;re willing to risk serious trouble, don&#146;t tell them about <small>rm -r *!</SMALL></P>
<p>If your environment is set up properly you shouldn&#146;t have to cover permissions or the ownership of files. Users learn about these on their own. If you can, give them some room in which to play, to use the old trial-and-error method so they can see for themselves what happens when they try different things. Also, keep an eye on them from a distance, and check up on them in the beginning from time to time. The point is to get them to overcome their fears and concerns that they are going to break something on these multitasking computer systems.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading24"></A><font color="#000077">5.12 Changing Shells</FONT></H3>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading25"></A><font color="#000077">5.12.1 Description</FONT></H4>
<p>There is an unobtrusive way to change a shell without affecting the password file in any way.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Example</B></FONT></P>
<p>Flavors: AT&ampT, BSD
</P>
<p>Shells: ksh, sh</P>
<p>You know that using the <small>chsh</SMALL> command physically changes the password file to the shell of your choice. That command also only permits shells that are listed in the /etc/shells file. So what do you do if you want to use the bash shell and it isn&#146;t listed? There is a way around it: The following seven lines of code for the .profile startup file will have you using the bash shell every time you log in or open a new window to a shell:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
if [ -x /usr/local/bin/bash ]; then
    SHELL=/usr/local/bin/bash
    export SHELL
    exec /usr/local/bin/bash
else
    echo /usr/local/bin/bash not found using default shell of
$SHELL
fi
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Line 1: Verify that the bash shell exists and is executable.
</P>
<p>Line 2: If it does exist, set the variable <small>SHELL</SMALL> to /usr/local/bin/bash.</P>
<p>Line 3: Export the variable globally.</P>
<p>Line 4: Start the bash shell</P>
<p>Line 6: If there was no bash shell, you have to use your default shell assigned to your account.</P>
<p>This concept can be applied to other shells with some minor changes to the syntax. Although this is good for your personal account, it is just as good for the root account if you are more comfortable working in a different shell as root. It works so well for root that, when you need to drop into single-user mode, the shell will not be located because the mount point most likely is not mounted in that mode, and the normal root shell takes over.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Reason</B></FONT></P>
<p>Everyone has a shell of choice, and this allows its use. It is unobtrusive and satisfies the needs of both the administrator and the user.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Real World Experience</B></FONT></P>
<p>This common little hack works well when it&#146;s embedded into the startup files. Also, other conditions besides the shell can be tested this way to see whether you are on a local or remote system and to execute specific commands. It gives your users freedom to start processes when they log in to a system and, when they log out, to stop them.
</P>

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading27"></A><font color="#000077">5.13.1 Description</FONT></H4>
<p>A little hack that determines where your display actually is.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Example</B></FONT></P>
<p>Flavor: BSD
</P>
<p>Shells: bash, ksh, sh</P>
<p>Do you work in a large networked environment and find yourself frequently running <small>rlogin</SMALL> or <small>telnet</SMALL> across the network? Are you always annoyed by constantly needing to set the <small>DISPLAY</SMALL> variable every time you want to point at the X display of the machine you are working on? Put the following lines into the .profile of your startup file in your home directory to automatically set the <small>DISPLAY</SMALL> variable for you:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
if [ &#147;$DISPLAY&#148; = &#147;&#148; ]; then
   if [ &#147;&#145;tty&#145;&#148; != &#147;/dev/console&#148; -o &#147;$TERM&#148; != &#147;console&#148; ]; then
      REMOTEHOSTNAME=&#147;&#145;who am i | cut -d&#146;(&#145; -f2,2 | cut -d&#146;)&#146;
-f1,1&#145;&#148;
      DISPLAY=&#147;$REMOTEHOSTNAME:0&#148;
      export DISPLAY
      fi
   fi
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Line 1: Check whether the <small>$DISPLAY</SMALL> has no value and continue.</P>
<p>Line 2: If the <small>tty</SMALL> is not the console device and the terminal doesn&#146;t equal the console, continue.</P>
<p>Line 3: Get the name of the host you came in from. This is determined by taking the output of the <small>who am I</SMALL> command and outputting the hostname from what&#146;s between the parenthesis.</P>
<p>Line 4: Set the <small>DISPLAY</SMALL> to the system you came from.</P>
<p>Line 5: Exit.</P>
<p>As you log in to a local workstation, the <small>$DISPLAY</SMALL> variable is checked to see whether it has no string defined. If there is none, the routine then checks whether you are local to the console. In this case you are local and nothing is done. If you <small>telnet</SMALL> into a remote host, the <small>$DISPLAY</SMALL> variable is checked to see whether it has a string defined. If there is no string defined, the routine checks to see whether you are local to the console. In this case you are not, so the routine does a <small>who am i</SMALL>. This command outputs information about who is logged in, the terminal device, a time stamp, and the reverse name lookup of the machine that you are coming from:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
rocket 3% who am i
roger        pts/5        Nov  2 07:39    (plane)
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>It then cuts the output from this command and collects only the hostname of the machine that you&#146;re coming from (in parentheses). The <small>DISPLAY</SMALL> variable is then set to this host and exported as a global variable.</P><p><br></P>
