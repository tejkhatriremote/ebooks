<p>One last note on the subject of core files. Time and time again, third-party first-line technical support people ask users to email the core files. Unless you want to have more problems on your hands, don&#146;t let your users do this! Tell them to use the FTP site, because core files are usually too big for email gateways and can get rejected or, worse, they can hang up in an SMTP gateway somewhere. Users often believe the person on the other end of the phone knows what he or she is talking about because they believe technical support knows what&#146;s best. Only UNIX administrators know what&#146;s best for their environment, right?

<h3><a name="Heading22"></A><font color="#000077">4.11 Monitoring Crash Files</FONT></H3>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading23"></A><font color="#000077">4.11.1 Description</FONT></H4>
<p>When a system crashes, crash files are created in crash directories that are already set up on the system to help diagnose problems.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Example</B></FONT></P>
<p>Flavors: AT&ampT, some newer BSD versions
</P>
<p>Check your man pages for <small>savecore</SMALL> to see whether your flavor is supported. Every flavor that is supported is configured a little differently.</P>
<p>If a system takes an unexpected crash, it can be configured to write out the contents of memory to the dump device, which is, in most cases, swap. When the system boots back up and processes the <small>S</SMALL><i>#</I><small>savecore</SMALL> script, it performs a check on the raw partition swap device to see whether data was dumped to it. If data is found, a file is created into /usr/adm/crash. This file generally takes on the name core.n, unix.n, or vmcore.n. Here is an example from SGI&#146;s IRIX:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
# cd /var/adm/crash
# ls -al
total 89688
drwxr-xr-x    2 root   sys      4096 Sep  9 10:18 ./
drwxr-xr-x    7 adm    adm      4096 Oct 18 01:01 ../
-rw-r--r--    1 root   sys      1294 Aug 12  11:28 analysis.0

-rw-------    1 root   sys   41918464 Sep 21  11:38 vmcore.0.comp
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Similar to core files, these large crash files (unix.0 and vmcore.0) are in a binary format. When the crash files are created, some flavors are nice enough to run an analysis on the crash files and build a report for you. Here is one such report that helps diagnose what the exact problem might have been:

<p><font size="+1"><b>Reason</B></FONT></P>
<p>This is a great feature that you should use whenever possible. When a system goes down, <small>syslog</SMALL> might not have time or the capability to log why the system crashed. In this case, you do not see any problems reported in the system log files, unless the problems have been developing over time. Because the contents of memory are dumped, it&#146;s more likely that you&#146;ll know why the system crashed.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Real World Experience</B></FONT></P>
<p>Because these are also core-type files written in binary, you might want to use the <small>strings</SMALL> command. In most cases there is useful information in the crash file. Although the vendors often have their own set of tools to extract problems from the crash files, they don&#146;t release these tools to system administrators. Your best chance is to try to <small>grep</SMALL> out any errors that might have been written to the crash file.</P>

<h3><a name="Heading24"></A><font color="#000077">4.12 Remember Daylight Savings Time</FONT></H3>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading25"></A><font color="#000077">4.12.1 Description</FONT></H4>
<p>Daylight savings time has the potential of wreaking havoc on your system. Everyone always thinks of the time change and checks all the system clocks, but what about the crontab?
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Reason</B></FONT></P>
<p>You always remember during these two important days of the year to verify that all the system clocks are current on all the systems in your environment. But did you remember to check the jobs that were scheduled to run in the crontab? Any job that is set up to run between 1:00 a.m. and 2:59 a.m. is affected by daylight savings time. This isn&#146;t once every 100 years or even once a year.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Real World Experience</B></FONT></P>
<p>In the month of October, all the entries in the crontab that are scheduled to run from 1:00 a.m. to 1:59 a.m. run twice. Many quick and dirty scripted programs that have been written in a hurry cannot handle such a situation. Most commercial programs written take into the account that a user (even us) might execute the program twice.
</P>
<p>In most cases you might not have anything too serious scheduled during this time period. If you do have jobs scheduled between these periods ask yourself what happens...</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the jobs run twice?
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the jobs take over an hour to finish and the same job executes and overlaps with the previous job?
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are any open files? Will they get corrupted?
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the database performs an update at that time?
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;To any system files that are touched or are affected during that time?
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;To user-scheduled jobs?
