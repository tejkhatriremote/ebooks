<p>If you have no plans on using the services, disable them. Each system will have to be judged on an individual basis. High-risk, secure, stand-alone systems do not need to accept requests from <small>tftp, talkd</SMALL>, or <small>fingerd</SMALL>, and they might never need to accept <small>ftp</SMALL> or even <small>telnet</SMALL>. Disable them. Users on standalone systems that are not even on a network or isolated should disable <small>bind, YP/NIS, bootpd, sendmail, routed</SMALL>, and other networking services; they are not necessary.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Real World Experience</B></FONT></P>
<p>In a perfect world programmers and engineers will not try to compile locally on file servers and suck up all the CPU time. Disabling <small>telnetd, rshd</SMALL>, and <small>rlogind</SMALL> is the only way to prevent them from doing this. The disadvantage is that administration of the system could only be done locally. But you all make sacrifices. Similar things have been done for security reasons on firewall systems. You will find that much more then these are disabled on a firewall system.</P>

<p>If a daemon has a habit of dying, monitor it and restart it if it dies.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Example</B></FONT></P>
<p>Flavors: AT&ampT
</P>
<p>Shells: csh, ksh.</P>
<p>The following csh script will keep an eye on the process table and check whether any predefined daemons have died. If they have died, restart them. If the process is still running, exit the script.</P>
<!-- CODE //-->
<pre>
#!/bin/csh

foreach DAEMON ( MonitorSuLog.pl MonitorLogins.pl DiskHogs.pl )
  ps -e | fgrep &#147;$DAEMON:t&#148; | cut -c1-8 &gt; /dev/null
  if ( $status &gt; 0 ) then
    echo &#147;Restarting $daemon&#148;
    date
    $DAEMON &amp
  endif
end
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE //-->
<p>Line 1: Define the shell to use for the script.
</P>
<p>Line 3: Process each of the defined daemons listed individually.</P>
<p>Line 4: Search through the Process table for the defined daemon and parse the results. If there is output, you don&#146;t want to see it, so send it to /dev/null.</P>
<p>Line 5: If the daemon was found in the process table, a status signal greater than 0 will exist and lines 6, 7, and 8 will be executed. If the daemon does not exist, stop here and go to line 10.</P>
<p>Line 6: Send the restart message to standard out.</P>
<p>Line 7: Send the current date and time to standard out.</P>
<p>Line 8: Start the daemon.</P>
<p>Line 9: End the testing.</P>
<p>Line 10: If there are more daemons to test, get the next daemon and check the daemon with line 4. If there are no more daemons to check, exit the script.</P>
<p>To get this to monitor the daemons continuously throughout the day, put an entry into the crontab and have it run every 10 minutes. Modify the crontab setting:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
# crontab -l &gt; /tmp/crontab.txt
# vi /tmp/crontab.txt
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Add the following line into the crontab file so that it runs the monitor script every 10 minutes:
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * /usr/local/bin/monitor_daemons
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>In the previous crontab entry, if accounting is turned on, all output from cron will be logged and possibly mailed to the user running this cron job. If you don&#146;t expect the daemons to die very often, it would be wise to use this entry to check how often the daemons are dying. If you expect the daemons to die a great deal, send the output to /dev/null with following crontab entry:
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * /usr/local/bin/monitor_daemons &gt;
&#8658; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp1
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>After the entry has been made in the crontab.txt file, submit the file to the cron. For security reasons, remove the crontab.txt file:
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
# /bin/crontab /tmp/crontab.txt
# rm /tmp/crontab.txt
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p><font size="+1"><b>Reason</B></FONT></P>
<p>This hack isn&#146;t a fix, but merely a patch. This is a problem. Daemons should not die if they are functioning properly. There are times when daemons pertaining to certain applications and system programs can die. If you do not have maintenance support, you could be out of luck and stuck with the problem. If you do have support, you already know that it takes time to get to that second- or third-level tech support person who knows what you are talking about, and time is not on your side.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Real World Experiences</B></FONT></P>
<p>Experience has shown that daemons die sometimes and for unknown reasons. Being faced with a DNS daemon dying twice a month and receiving those wonderful early morning calls is no fun. Because the problem might occur only rarely, it can be very difficult to figure out. This hack patches the problem quickly and, if nothing else, stops your pager from going off.
</P>
<p>Another great use for this hack is to monitor a process; but instead of restarting the daemon, you can start a new process when the old one dies. There are times when data cannot be verified, checked, or processed until another program finishes, so keeping an eye on specific processes can help to automate your environment.</P>

<h3><a name="Heading12"></A><font color="#000077">1.6 fuser Instead of ps</FONT></H3>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading13"></A><font color="#000077">1.6.1 Description</FONT></H4>
<p>Here is an alternative way to get the process ID (PID) of a particular process. The <small>fuser</SMALL> command is more reliable and can be quicker than <small>ps</SMALL>.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Example</B></FONT></P>
<p>Flavors: AT&T, BSD
</P>
<p>Shells: All</P>
<p>Syntax:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
/usr/sbin/fuser <i>files</I>
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Command:
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
<b>/usr/sbin/fuser</B> /bin/csh
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>The <small>fuser</SMALL> command outputs the PIDs of all processes that are currently opened under the named file. If a named directory is passed through <small>fuser</SMALL>, the PIDs of all the processes that have a file or files open for reading in that directory are displayed. The files passed must be fully qualified in order for the command to function properly. If they are not, the proper syntax is displayed on standard output.</P>
<p>There is one caveat to using this command. You must have read access to /dev/kmem and /dev/mem. This is because <small>fuser</SMALL> takes an actual snapshot of the system image that is found in these character devices at the time it is executed.</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
# fuser /bin/csh
/bin/csh:    1485t 1106t
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>The <small>t</SMALL> at the end of the each PID denotes that these processes have their own executable text segment that is open.</P>
<p>The <small>fuser</SMALL> command has an option (<small>-k</SMALL>) that can be passed to send a kill signal to the PID. So, to kill all the csh processes, execute the following simple command:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
# fuser -k /bin/csh
/bin/csh:   1485t 1106t
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>This replaces the following set of commands you would use a number of times throughout the day:
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
# ps -ef | grep csh

root 1484 1485  1 17:54:02 pts/1   0:00 /bin/csh
root 1116 1117  1 17:54:16 pts/1   0:00 grep csh
root 1090 1091  0   Aug 09 pts/2   0:00 /bin/csh

# kill 1484 1090
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>If multiple processes are associated with a particular process that you run within your environment, you can easily write a script to kill the application and all the daemons associated with it.
</P>
<p>Suppose an application lives in /sbin called bsr. It has several daemons that run independently from bsr, such as <small>bsrqqd, bsrexecd</SMALL>, and <small>bsrojbd</SMALL>. You can write a quick-and-dirty script to kill the entire application by using <small>fuser</SMALL>:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
#! /bin/sh

fuser -k /sbin/bsr
fuser -k /sbin/bsrqqd
fuser -k /sbin/bsrexecd
fuser -k /sbin/bsrojbd
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Line 1: Define the shell to use.
</P>
