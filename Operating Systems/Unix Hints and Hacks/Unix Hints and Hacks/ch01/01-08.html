<p><font size="+1"><b>Example Six: Blocking Remote FTP Access</B></FONT></P>
<p>Flavors: AT&T and BSD
</P>
<p>There is a way to block the access of FTP connections into your system, besides using the method in example three. There is a file within the /etc directory called users. This file contains the list of user accounts that are not allowed to have FTP access into the system. If their name does not appear in the list, users are allowed to FTP in to the system. The file is processed by the FTP daemon each time a connection is established. There are no daemons to kill or restart after the file has been modified. It becomes active as soon as it is written.</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
# vi /etc/users
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Step 1: Edit the FTP denial list /etc/users.
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
root
ajlesser
adjony
dradler
gtromero
  etc...
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Step 2: Insert entries into the file. The format of the file is the user&#146;s account name.
</P>
<p>This file might already exist with a single username in it. It is a good security practice not to have root-level FTP access into a system. So you might see the account root in this file.</P>
<p>If you have a large /etc/passwd file filled with users, you can execute the simple multishell command to build the list for you.</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
# cut -d&#147;:&#148; -f1 /etc/passwd &gt; /etc/users
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>This command cuts out the first field using the <small>:</SMALL> as the delimiter in the password file. Next, this field in the password file is the user&#146;s account ID. Then the command sends the list of IDs to the FTP access file called users.</P>
<p>If you are running NIS/YP on the system, the command to get the global YP password file would be</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
# ypcat passwd | cut -d&#147;:&#148; -f1 &gt; /etc/users
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>This line reads the password file off the YP master server and outputs the first field, like in the previous example, to the FTP access file called users.
</P>
<p>It is a good idea to review this file and check to make sure that everyone in the list needs to be blocked out from the procedures you will be performing on the system.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Reason</B></FONT></P>
<p>Many users love to ignore the notices of system outages and will attempt to log in to a system while you are trying to make changes, do backups, or perform updates to the system.
</P>
<p>Any time you feel that users will be affected by certain changes that you might be doing to the system, it is a good idea to have users off the system. If you plan to install patches, run backups, create soft-links, move data or filesystems around, make mass changes to the password file, make network changes, or modify the system configurations, it is a good idea not to allow any users on the system.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Real World Experience</B></FONT></P>
<p>There are some situations in a 24/7 shop where blocking access to the system cannot be allowed. In situations such as this, the only recourse is to work with the users closely and make sure they stay away from the areas that would affect them. This is sometimes the only possible solution. It also shows you are paying them more attention than others have in the past. If this is not a possible solution, there is no recourse but to schedule an outage or downtime for the system.
</P>
<p>To keep your phone from ringing while you are trying to work during this time, provide the users with messages. More is always better; users love to be kept informed. Do not rely on emailing out a notification of when the system will not be available. Many users skim through the many emails that they receive and pass over this type of message. If a user attempts to log in to a system and gets a &#147;Connection refused&#148; error and there is no message set, it&#146;s guaranteed that he forgot or didn&#146;t know the system was going to be unavailable and your phone will be ringing.</P>
<p>In your message, don&#146;t be technical&#151;keep it simple and to the point. The more difficult the message makes the problem sound, the longer they will think the repair is going to take. Try to provide an accurate guess of when you expect the system to be back on line. I try to give myself an extra 30 minutes in case a problem comes up.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>Warning:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Impatient users will write programs to monitor the system you are working on. The millisecond their programs tell them the system is up, the program will start running processes for that user. If you inadvertently allow access before you have finished your work, users might be in the system without you even knowing it.</FONT><hr>

<h3><a name="Heading22"></A><font color="#000077">1.11 Rewinding Tapes Fast</FONT></H3>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading23"></A><font color="#000077">1.11.1 Description</FONT></H4>
<p>You are all aware that you can rewind tapes the old-fashioned way with the <small>mt</SMALL> command, but there is a faster way.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Example</B></FONT></P>
<p>Flavors: AT&T and BSD
</P>
<p>Shells: bsh, bash, ksh</P>
<p>Syntax:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
<b>&lt;</B> device
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>All it takes to force the system to rewind the tape is to redirect the tape device to absolutely nothing.
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
$ &lt; /dev/rmt/0cbn
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Of course, your device name might differ from that in the example.
</P>
<p>If you have multiple tape drives attached to a system or you want to save time spent typing the command, you could first set the name of the tape device in your environment variables. Then the command could be even shorter:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
$ DAT=/dev/rmt/2n
$ DLT=/dev/rmt/0cbn
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Step 1: Set the environment variable in the shell for the tape devices.
</P>
<p>Step 2: Rewind the tape.</P>
<p>A practical use for this command is to create a simple script to <small>tar</SMALL> off data to tape, making sure that the tape is rewound in the beginning and in the end.</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
#! /bin/sh

DLT=&#147;/dev/rmt/0cbn&#148;
&lt; $DLT
tar -cvf $DLT /usr/spool/mail
&lt; $DLT
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Line 1: Define the shell to be used.
</P>
<p>Line 3: Set the variable <small>DLT</SMALL> to be the tape device.</P>
<p>Line 4: Rewind the tape device so you are at the beginning.</P>
<p>Line 5: Tar off the files to the tape device.</P>
<p>Line 6: Rewind the device again to the beginning.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Reason</B></FONT></P>
<p>This little hack is merely a shortcut to using the magnetic tape rewind command that comes with UNIX.
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
$ mt -f /dev/rmt/0cbn rewind
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p><font size="+1"><b>Real Word Experience</B></FONT></P>
<p>Many times you are asked to write data off to tape for users. You can simplify the previous sample script into a one-liner at a shell prompt with

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading25"></A><font color="#000077">1.12.1 Description</FONT></H4>
<p>This function script counts from and to a range of numbers.
</P>
<p>Flavors: AT&T and BSD</P>
<p>Shell: sh</P>
<p>This script counts between a range of numbers that are passed through STDIN. It is sometimes necessary to generate a range of numbers to be used within a command or another shell script.</P>
<!-- CODE //-->
<pre>
#! /bin/sh

LO=$1;HI=$2

while [ $LO -le $HI ]
do
  echo -n $LO &#147; &#148;
  LO=&#145;expr $LO &#43; 1&#145;
done
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE //-->
<p>Line 1: Define the shell being used.
</P>
<p>Line 3: Set the variable <small>$LO</SMALL> to the first argument passed to STDIN. Set the variable <small>$HI</SMALL> to the second argument passed to STDIN.</P>
<p>Line 5: Process through the range of numbers until <small>$LO</SMALL> is greater than <small>$HI</SMALL>.</P>
<p>Line 7: Output the current number in <small>$LO</SMALL>.</P>
<p>Line 8: Increment the number in <small>$LO</SMALL>.</P>
<p>Line 9: Exit if <small>$LO</SMALL> is greater than <small>$HI</SMALL>; otherwise, continue with the next number in the range.</P>
<p>If the previous script is named <small>count</SMALL> and executed</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
$ count 4 13
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>the script will count from 4 to 13 without any carriage returns.
