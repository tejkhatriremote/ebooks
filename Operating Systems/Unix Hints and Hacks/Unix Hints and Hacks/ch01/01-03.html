<p><font size="+1"><b>Example Two: The Perl Method</B></FONT></P>
<p>Flavors: AT&T, BSD
</P>
<p>Shell Script: Perl</P>
<p>Here is a generic approach using a Perl script to achieve the same results as in the previous example. This can be embedded within a larger Perl program so as not to spawn another process.</P>
<!-- CODE //-->
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use POSIX;

@THE_DATE = localtime (time);
&#43;&#43;$THE_DATE[3];
if ((localtime (POSIX::mktime (@THE_DATE)))[3] == 1) {
        exit 0;
}
exit 1;
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE //-->
<p>Line 1: Define the script to be a Perl script.
</P>
<p>Line 3: Use the POSIX module.</P>
<p>Line 5: Take the local time and fill the array <small>THE_DATE</SMALL>.</P>
<p>Line 6: Add one day to the date.</P>
<p>Line 7: Use <small>mktime</SMALL> to normalize the date in the array <small>THE_DATE</SMALL>. Test whether the day has become the first day of the next month.</P>
<p>Line 8: If it is the first day of the next month, exit with a status of <small>1</SMALL>.</P>
<p>Line 10: Otherwise, result in an exit status of <small>0</SMALL>.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Reason</B></FONT></P>
<p>There will be times when you&#146;ll need to execute programs (such as full backups, batch jobs, filtering of log files, or system utilization) on the last day of the month. At first glance, you might think this is an easy task. Why even use scripts? Why not set up a line in the crontab? Use a script such as this because there is a problem with cron; it allows execution only on any or all days 1&#150;31. But cron cannot determine the last day of each month, so you must find a way to figure it out.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Real World Experience</B></FONT></P>
<p>This little hack has come in handy many times. It is very easy to attach it to existing scripts for sending out utilization, disk usage, and user access logs, along with other useful reports, to management and to users on a monthly basis. It is nice to hear users or your boss thanking you for taking the extra time to do the reports each month. Little do they know how easy it is.

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading9"></A><font color="#000077">1.4.1 Description</FONT></H4>
<p>Tune your system more by disabling all unwanted and unused daemons from running on the system. This can be done by editing the /etc/inetd.conf file and the rc files or directories.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Example One: Disabling Daemons from inetd.conf</B></FONT></P>
<p>Flavors: AT&T, BSD
</P>
<p>Modify the /etc/inetd.conf file and disable unnecessary daemons running on the system.</P>
<!-- CODE //-->
<pre>
# vi /etc/inetd.conf

#
# Configuration file for inetd(1M). See inetd.conf(4).
#
# To re-configure the running inetd process, edit this file, then
# send the inetd process a SIGHUP.  kill -HUP [PID]
#
#ftp    stream tcp  nowait root   /usr/sbin/in.ftpd    in.ftpd -l
#telnet stream tcp  nowait root   /usr/sbin/in.telnetd in.telnetd
#talk   dgram  udp  wait   root   /usr/sbin/in.talkd   in.talkd
#ntalk  dgram  udp  wait   root   /usr/sbin/in.ntalkd  in.ntalkd
#uucp   stream tcp  nowait root   /usr/sbin/in.uucpd   in.uucpd
#
#finger stream tcp  nowait nobody /usr/sbin/in.fingerd in.fingerd
#tftp   dgram  udp  wait   root   /usr/sbin/in.tftpd   in.tftpd
#bootps dgram  udp  wait   root   /usr/sbin/in.bootpd  in.bootpd
#talk   dgram  udp  wait   root   /usr/sbin/tcpd       in.talkd
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE //-->
<p>After the /etc/inetd.conf file has been modified and daemons have been disabled, find the process ID (PID) of the inetd daemon that is running and restart it with the <small>kill -HUP</SMALL> command.</P>
<p>Flavor: AT&T</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
# ps -ef | grep inetd
root 124   1     ?       S 30:57 /usr/sbin/inetd -s
ugu  10377 10378 pts/4    S  0:00 grep inetd

# kill -HUP 124
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Flavor: BSD
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
# ps -ax | grep inetd
124   ?        S 30:57 /usr/sbin/inetd -s
10377 pts/4    S  0:00 grep inetd

# kill -HUP 124
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>If accounting is turned on you can check the system log files (/var/adm/messages or /var/adm/SYSLOG) to verify the inetd daemon had restarted. If you check the process table again, you&#146;ll see that the PID never changed. It isn&#146;t suppose to. A <small>kill -HUP</SMALL> does not kill the process, it actually sends a hang-up signal. Many daemons, such as the inetd daemon, will catch the signal and reread its configuration file and continue running.</P>
<p>If the process didn&#146;t restart and you can still connect to the daemons, it is not advisable but it is possible to kill the inetd daemon and restart it manually. It should be done in one single command line, if possible:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
# kill 124; /usr/etc/inetd
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Then check the process table (<small>ps -ef</SMALL> or <small>ps -ax</SMALL>) to verify that the daemon is running. This time it will have a new PID.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Example Two: Disabling from rc</B></FONT></P>
<p>Flavors: BSD
</P>
<p>Another area that starts daemons controlled by the system or applications is the rc files and directories. Depending on the flavor, the startup area can be in the form of rc files, or a series of files in an rc.# directory. The rc files or files within the rc.# directories are scripts that perform filesystem housekeeping and startup system daemons that together bring up the UNIX operating system.</P>
<p>This is a very dangerous area. It is wise to know exactly what you are attempting to disable before you actually do. If a daemon or process is kept from executing from this area, you can inadvertently hang at boot time or keep the system from coming up. If this happened and you couldn&#146;t even boot to an init state of single user, you would be forced to boot miniroot off of disks or CD-ROM. It is highly recommended that a backup is made of any rc files before they are modified.</P>
<p>After changes are made to the necessary rc files, a reboot is necessary to verify that the changes will take affect. Some administrators will kill the processes associated with the daemons in the rc files, wait a few hours, and reboot when the user takes a lunch or goes home at the end of the day. This is okay, as long as you don&#146;t forget!</P>
<p>Many times have I seen a case where an administrator gets caught up in another issue and forgets about the modifications he made to the rc files and directories. What happens next? You can see it coming. A few days or a week later, for some reason or another, the system reboots or crashes. Now when the system begins its boot-up process, by some dumb luck your untested changes from before don&#146;t let the system come up. You created a new problem to add to your list of open issues. What&#146;s worse is that you&#146;re not around and your backup administrator has to deal with the problem not knowing the changes you made.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Reason</B></FONT></P>
<p>When computers arrive from the manufacturer, in most cases, they are fully loaded and turned on with everything they can give you. If you rebuild the system from scratch, the default installation will, in most cases, install more software than you actually need on your system. Because there are more systems than administrators in the world, the manufacturers want to make it as easy for the user as possible. So they give the user almost everything.
</P>
<p>The two main reasons you want to make these changes are security and performance. Disabling the unwanted daemons locks down any possible holes, provides one fewer system function for you to administer, and allows more space in memory and less CPU time to eat up unnecessary processes.</P><p><br></P>
