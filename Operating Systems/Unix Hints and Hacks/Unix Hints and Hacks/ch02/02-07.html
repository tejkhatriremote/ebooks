<p><font size="+1"><b>Reasons</B></FONT></P>
<p>The situations in which you want to unmount a device can be anything from labeling a disk on-the-fly, unmounting a CD from a CD-ROM drive, dealing with stale mount points, or moving NFS mount points. It is a safe and clean way to do things and keep users off the device when only you need access to it without having to take the system down.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Real World Experiences</B></FONT></P>
<p>Always double-check the open shells you have on your desktop or console terminal. I can&#146;t begin to tell you how many times system administrators have been caught by this. They would verify the device to unmount, switch to the root account, and then change directories to the root level or the system. All the while, they forget that their original shell underneath is still inside the device that is trying to be unmounted.
</P>
<p>Another variation is to log in to the console terminal, examine the device to be unmounted, and then start up the window manager under the root account. All new shells start at the root level, but once again the original login shell is sitting inside the device.</P>
<p>Storage devices (Disk drives and arrays) are notorious for crashing systems when they are about to die. It is a good idea&#151;if the drive is making noise or sending I/O errors to the console&#151;to get as much backed up as possible and unmount it, making it inactive to the system until you can get it replaced or schedule some down time.</P>
<p>Many environments have very little disk space so, as the need for more disk space begins to expand, you find yourself becoming very familiar with NFS <small>mount</SMALL> and <small>unmount</SMALL> commands, especially when a server goes down and all the mount points go stale. The <small>unmount</SMALL> command is useful when this occurs.</P>
<p>Some system administrators have been known to use the <small>unmount</SMALL> command when performing their backups. By freezing a disk for backups on a nightly basis, the device is made unavailable to the users so clean backups can be executed without any files or databases being modified. This isn&#146;t highly recommended without a good set of procedures in place.</P>

<h3><a name="Heading16"></A><font color="#000077">2.8 Static Routing or routed</FONT></H3>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading17"></A><font color="#000077">2.8.1 Description</FONT></H4>
<p>A system can use two methods, static routing or <small>routed</SMALL>, for determining where the gateways are so packets can be routed to reach their destination. Both have advantages and disadvantages.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Example One: Default Routing</B></FONT></P>
<p>Flavors: AT&ampT and BSD
</P>
<p>Syntax:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
<b>ifconfig</B> interface
<b>netstat -rn</B>
<b>route</B> command [[modifiers] args] [metric]
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Adding a static route to direct packets to the local gateway optimizes the transmission of all nonlocal packets. In using this method, there is no overhead in searching the local network for available gateways. The system knows that all packets are directed to one specific default gateway for delivery.
</P>
<p>Suppose you have two network interface cards in one system and these cards sit on two distinct subnets (<small>206.19.11</SMALL> and <small>139.107.100</SMALL>). If you want to send some packets to one subnet and the rest of the packets to another subnet, you can set up static routes. To route the packets to the <small>139.107.100</SMALL> gateway and the other packets to the <small>206.19.11</SMALL> gateway, set it up like this:</P>
<!-- CODE //-->
<pre>
# ifconfig ec0
ec0: flags=c63&lt;UP,BROADCAST,NOTRAILERS,RUNNING,FILTMULTI,
&#8658;MULTICAST&gt;
        inet 206.19.11.3 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast
&#8658;206.19.11.255
# ifconfig ec2
ec2: flags=c63&lt;UP,BROADCAST,NOTRAILERS,RUNNING,FILTMULTI,
&#8658;MULTICAST&gt;
        inet 139.107.100.18 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast
&#8658;139.107.100.255

# route add default 206.19.11.254 1
# route add net 139.107.100 139.107.100.254 1

# netstat -rn
Destination  Gateway         Netmask    Flags    Refs
&#8658;Use  Interface
default      206.19.11.254              UG        21
&#8658;523617  ec0
139.107.243  139.107.100.254 0xffffff00 UG         0
&#8658;6854  ec2
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE //-->
<p>Lines 1&#150;4: Show the current configurations of the network interface. Each interface has a unique IP address on its respective subnets.
</P>
<p>Line 6: Add a <small>route</SMALL> that, by default, sends all packets to <small>206.19.16.254</SMALL> at a cost of only one hop if no other static routes are defined.</P>
<p>Line 7: Add a <small>route</SMALL> that sends all packets going to the <small>139.107.100</SMALL> network to the gateway address <small>139.104.100.254</SMALL> at a cost of only one hop.</P>
<p>Line 9: Use the <small>netstat -rn</SMALL> command to display all the routing table information as IP addresses instead of attempting to resolve its hostname.</P>
<p>Lines 10&#150;12: Show the output of the routing information.</P>
<p>All packets for subnet <small>139.104.243</SMALL> are sent to the gateway address <small>139.104.100.254</SMALL>, using the gateway that is up through the interface <small>ec2</SMALL>.</P>
<p>If the packets are not for subnet <small>139.107.100</SMALL>, send everything else to the default IP address at <small>206.19.11.254</SMALL>, which is a gateway that is up and can be reached by using the interface <small>ec0</SMALL>.</P><p><br></P>
