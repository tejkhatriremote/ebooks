<h2><a name="Heading1"></A><font color="#000077">Appendix D<br>Administration Tools and Recommended Organizations
</FONT></H2>
<p>Some of the best tools and resources available to system administrators are not commercial products but are available free on the Internet. This appendix contains a list of 30 freely available system administration, networking, and security tools that many top UNIX administrators utilized over the years. If you plan to use any of these tools, it is best to fully test them on a development system and not a production system first.
</P>
<p>After the tools list, you&#146;ll find a list of fantastic organizations that UNIX administrators should think about being a part of. They can provide a wealth of information in helping you as a computer professional stay current in the industry.</P>

AMANDA users native dump and/or GNU tar facilities and can back up a large number of workstations running multiple versions of UNIX. Recent versions can also use SAMBA to back up Microsoft Windows 95/NT hosts.&#148; <a href="http://www.amanda.org">http://www.amanda.org</A>
<dt><b>lsof</B>
<dd>Lists open files that are locked to running processes. This is a great tool for finding running processes and keeping you from unmounting a particular filesystem. It is also a useful tool in diagnosing which files may be out of control or running wild. <a href="WebStripper/protected.html#link=ftp://vic.cc.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/lsof/readme">ftp://vic.cc.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/lsof/README</A>

<dt><b>Mirror</B>
<dd>The Mirror 2.9 Reference Manual provides the following short description of this utility: &#147;Mirror is a package written in Perl that uses the ftp protocol to duplicate a directory hierarchy between the machine it is run on and a remote host. It avoids copying files unnecessarily by comparing the file timestamps and sizes before transferring. Amongst other things, it can optionally rename, compress, gzip, and split files.&#148; <a href="WebStripper/protected.html#link=ftp://ftp.cs.columbia.edu/archives/perl/mirror/index.html">ftp://ftp.cs.columbia.edu/archives/perl/mirror/index.html</A>
