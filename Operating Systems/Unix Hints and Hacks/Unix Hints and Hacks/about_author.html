<h2><a name="Heading1"></A><font color="#000077">About the Author</FONT></H2>
<p><b>Kirk Waingrow</B> has been a UNIX administrator working on more than 8 different flavors of UNIX over the past over 10 years. For the last 5 years, he has supported the UNIX environment for Walt Disney Imagineering, working with the Walt Disney Company&#146;s Research &amp Development organization and providing UNIX installation support to new attractions at various Disney theme parks. In the past 4 years he has built the largest automated UNIX resource on the Internet with over 25,000 UNIX administrators supporting the UNIX Guru Universe Web site. Kirk continues to work with various UNIX organizations, always trying to find ways to provide added resources for those working in the UNIX industry.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Acknowledgments</FONT></H3>
<p>When I started the UNIX Guru Universe Web site, I knew it would grow extremely rapidly because of the type of people who use it on a regular basis. UNIX administrators share information, and the site has given them the opportunity to do just that. This book could never have been completed without them and the information provided by the many UNIX Administrators who use the Web site daily. They are living proof that they enjoy supporting this incredible operating system. The long hours that they spend to keep systems operational for the sake of the users and for the love of the work keeps me working to maintain the knowledge that I share with my peers. We are often underpaid, taken advantage of for our knowledge, and abused by both users and management, but we still love the work.
</P>
<p>There are many who, through the course of my life, have helped my destiny become not so ill-fated as I once thought it would be. I&#146;d like to thank Edward O&#146;Neil, for letting a 14-year-old kid play with a DEC PDP-11/750 unattended; Todd Howard, for teaching me that there was more to computers than just games (namely programming, so you can make your own games); my parents and family, for supporting me in my interest in computers, from games to programming to education, and most of all for not taking the computer away after I&#146;d hacked into various organizations. Special thanks to all my friends who supported me over the years and now call on me to set up their computers.</P>
<p>There are certain people in this industry who are inspirations to me and to everyone else. They help to keep UNIX thriving, and they educate many people on the wonders of UNIX. Rob Kolstad, Evi Nemeth, Trent Hein, Brent Chapman and Elizabeth Zwicky, and Hal Pomeranz. Thank you for all your work and for being the special UNIX gurus who are worth looking up to!</P>
<p>I want to thank all those at WDI for their support and who might have covered for me during the writing of the manuscript: Bill Rothe, Bill McAdams, Jeff Mirich, Renard Fuentes, Victor Ho, E.J. Stephens, Debbie DelMar, Kay Newman, Scott Watson, Gary Daines, and the rest of the gang. Most of all, I am sincere when I say thanks to Steve Acheson““I never learned so much UNIX in such a short time.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">Dedication</FONT></H3>
<p>This book is dedicated to the two most important people I could ever have in my life. My precious wife, Gloria, the most beautiful and intelligent UNIX administrator I have been able to work beside, and my daughter Cassie““they just don&#146;t come any better!
</P>
<p>In memory of Thomas Murray (May 3, 1966&#150;June 26, 1997), a UNIX system administrator for the Walt Disney Company. After diagnosed with a terminal illness, Thomas always thought of others before he thought of himself and still wanted to continue working every chance he could. He always supported the people and users he worked with and was a friend to everyone. Thomas will never be forgotten by the UNIX administrators who were lucky enough to work with him.</P>
