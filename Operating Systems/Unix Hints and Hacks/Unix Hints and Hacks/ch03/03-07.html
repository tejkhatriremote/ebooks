<p>After leaving a boring, strict, computing environment, I entered into a position as a senior UNIX administrator in a very trusted environment. The definition of <i>trusted</I> in this place was that everyone trusted everyone, and nothing was a secret on the computers. Screens were meant to be unlocked and usable by all if needed.</P>
<p>One day when I was installing software on a system, I went to lunch while the 100MB software package was installing. Like a good administrator, I locked the terminal (mistake #1) so no one would disturb the software being loaded. I never left a note (mistake #2). Because the screen was locked, I figured no one would touch the keyboard. When I returned, the system was sitting at the PROM level and the machine wouldn&#146;t boot. After asking around the room, I was told that if there was nothing on the screen, nothing is going on and they thought they could do anything they wanted to the box. So they hit the power button, because they couldn&#146;t get past the locked screen.</P>
<p>The software made kernel modifications during the install and the system could not successfully recover from the crash. I was forced to rebuild the OS. Although clearing the screen and locking it up is always good, each environment has to be evaluated on an individual basis. I learned it the hard way, on a Friday afternoon.</P>

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading21"></A><font color="#000077">3.10.1 Description</FONT></H4>
<p>Some of the best security tools for UNIX administrators are on the Internet, not from a vendor. They are developed by administrators for administrators. Most of the power tools started out as an idea and were written because nothing else was out there that could do the job. Some famous UNIX administrators like to say Why reinvent the wheel if someone else has already made it round?
</P>
<p>These power tools are typically introduced at a couple of the UNIX system administration conferences, such as LISA (Large Installation of Systems Administrators), SANS (System Administration &amp Network Security), or one of the other USENIX conferences. They are brought into the technical sessions and most of the creators of these power tools listen to the needs of other administrators and attempt to adapt them into upcoming releases. The new tools are usually found in the CERT/CC security tools archive. The basic power tools of the trade are a necessity and include COPS, Crack, SATAN, TCP wrappers, tripwire, and kerberos.</P>
<p>The <i>Computer Oracle and Password System (COPS)</I> is a set of scripts and programs that monitors UNIX system security. If a problem is discovered, the administrator receives an email notification. COPS makes no attempt to fix any of the problems that it discovers. It assumes that you should have the most secure system possible, and the report is usually substantially long. In this case, more is always good. COPS tracks and monitors the following:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;User home directories that have write access
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The permissions and contents of the password and group files
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The modes and permissions for files, directories, and devices
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The crontab entries and all system startup files
</DL>
<p><i>Crack</I> is a password guessing program that is designed to quickly find passwords that exist within the password file using several common techniques. It does not support shadow password files and assumes that the second field has an encrypted string. It moves throughout the password file looking for users who have chosen weak passwords. Crack can find passwords in a manner of minutes. The results of the passwords that have been cracked are stored in a plain text file. If left running for long periods, Crack can surprise you and your boss when you have his password.</P>
<p>The <i>Security Analysis Tool for Auditing Networks (SATAN)</I> gathers as much information about remote hosts and networks as possible by examining such network devices as finger, NFS, NIS, FTP, tftp, rexd, and other services as well. It searches for incorrectly configured devices, bugs in network utilities, and poor or ignorant policy decisions that might have been made by a company. All the data can be examined and queried, and reports can be generated and analyzed via a Web-based browser.</P>
<p><i>TCP wrappers</I> is a set of TCP daemons that control access to TCP connection services, such as telnet, rlogin, and finger. Access can be controlled to allow or deny one host to an entire network of hosts&#146; addresses. Configuration has been made as easy as swapping out the daemon within the /etc/inetd.conf file and restarting inetd and telling it who is allowed and who is denied access into the machine. There is also additional information on the incoming hosts that gets logged.</P>
<p><i>tripwire</I> collects permission and checksum information on key system file areas that you can define. It detects if files have been replaced or tampered with or if some type of change in permissions has taken place. An email of its findings is sent to the administrator. Depending on the amount of files being monitored, tripwire can be pretty disk I/O intensive, if continuously run throughout the day. Running it is a very good idea, even if it is once or twice a day.</P>
<p><i>kerberos</I> uses DES encryption to authenticate users and services to prove that they are in fact who they claim to be. It passes tickets throughout a network to certify the identity of a user and provide access to all network services. It provides the security of passwords without requiring that someone types a password every few minutes.</P>
