<p>You can place a function in the .profile file and call it from a shell. The function enables you to change an environment variable quickly and easily.
</P>
<!-- CODE //-->
<pre>
rocket 7% vi ~/.profile

term()
{
  if [ -z &#147;${1}&#148; ]; then
      echo &#147;Your TERM type is set to $TERM&#148;
  else
      echo &#147;Your TERM was $TERM \c&#148;
      TERM=${1}
      export TERM
      echo &#147;and is now $TERM&#148;
  fi
}
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE //-->
<p>Line 1: Define the function called <small>term</SMALL>.</P>
<p>Line 2: Start of the function.</P>
<p>Line 3: If a there was no terminal type passed to the function, proceed to line 4.</P>
<p>Line 4: Display the current terminal type setting.</P>
<p>Line 5: If the terminal type was passed to the function, proceed to line 6.</P>
<p>Line 6: Display the old terminal type setting.</P>
<p>Line 7: Set the terminal type to the value passed to the function.</P>
<p>Line 8: Make the <small>TERM</SMALL> variable usable to the current shell.</P>
<p>Line 9: Display the new <small>TERM</SMALL> variable setting.</P>
<p>Line 10: Close the regular expression.</P>
<p>Line 11: End of function.</P>
<p>The next time you log in to the system and are dropped into a shell, you can type <small>term</SMALL> to find out the current terminal type.</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
$ term
Your TERM type is set to vt100
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>If you want to change the terminal type, pass it through to the <small>term</SMALL> function.</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
$ term ansi
Your TERM was vt100 and is now ansi
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Keep in mind that when you&#146;re working with these functions, they run before any commands in the path with the same name. This means that if there is a /usr/local/bin/term, the function <small>term</SMALL> would run first unless you fully qualify the program /usr/local/bin/term to run.</P>

<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>These functions do not carry over to subshells. If you shell out of an application, the function isn&#146;t available.</FONT><hr>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Reason</B></FONT></P>
<p>Every time you connect to the server from a local terminal, the network, or over a modem, you need to set the proper terminal type to make use of all the special features that your terminal has to offer.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Real World Experience</B></FONT></P>
<p>There are certain instances when the terminal setting you select does not work. Even if you have all the proper termcap/terminfo entries, on some occasions the settings don&#146;t work across various platforms. These cases are few, but they have been noticed when an xterm or window shell (wsh) session is open on an AT&ampT system; after the user logs into a remote BSD-type system, the terminal emulation becomes confused. Although simple commands such as <small>clear</SMALL> might work, if you attempt to run the <small>vi</SMALL> editor, the cursor remains at the bottom of the screen instead of at the top.</P>
<p>You have a couple of options when this happens. You should try another terminal type. Most systems offer more than one type of terminal shell in their environments. If you work in a windowing environment, there is xterm, xwsh, and wsh, to name a few. You also can try to exit the windowing environment and drop down to the console level to see whether the console terminal can be emulated correctly.</P>
<p>What you are about to read is not recommended except for those extremely proficient with <small>vi</SMALL>, but if nothing seems to work and you have to edit a file with <small>vi</SMALL>, you can <small>vi</SMALL> the file. You should limit yourself to basic commands such as <small>search, h, l, insert</SMALL>, escape, write, and quit. Always back up the original file before you attempt this and check the file with <small>more</SMALL> or <small>cat</SMALL> to verify that the changes worked.</P>
<p>If you are in a fast-paced environment where you don&#146;t have time to mess around with finding the right terminal types, or an emergency occurs where the proper terminal settings are not available, <small>vi</SMALL> can still be used to edit a file. You should test this method now and become comfortable in this mode before you are forced to use it: Set the terminal type to an incorrect terminal and learn how to move around in <small>vi</SMALL>. If you do this, the next time you&#146;re in a crunch you won&#146;t have to fiddle around with emulation problems. When necessary, use the clear screen (Ctrl&#43;L) command to refresh the screen to verify the current line and changes that have been made. This is not a recommended administrative practice, but it can be done. Also learn the UNIX <small>ed</SMALL> line editor for those times when you are in a bind.</P>

<p>You can set terminal I/O options for the device that is the current terminal providing the standard input. When the <small>stty</SMALL> command is executed alone, it provides the current settings of all the available options:</P>

<p>Although many options are available, I&#146;ll mention only some of the most common that a system administrator will run across. Check the man pages on your system for more details about the meaning and features the other options provide.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Example One: Dealing with ^? or ^H</B></FONT></P>
<p>Flavors: AT&ampT, BSD
</P>
<p>Syntax:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
stty [options]
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Everyone has experienced it at one point or another: You hit the backspace and you get the <small>^H</SMALL> or <small>^?</SMALL> character. This happens when the keys are incorrectly mapped by the terminal type settings in termcap or terminfo. You generally see this only when the vendor has optioned for the Delete key to control backspacing on the terminal instead of the Backspace key. So how do you get rid of it? Fast!</P>
<p>There are a few simple ways to do handle this situation. The <small>^?</SMALL> and <small>^H</SMALL> aren&#146;t dependent on the shell that you are in; they&#146;re dependent on the keys they&#146;re mapped to. The following examples show how the commands can be used for any shell type.</P>
<p>Shells: sh, ksh</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
$ stty erase ^?
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Shell: csh
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
% stty erase ^H
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Use the <small>erase</SMALL> option in <small>stty</SMALL> to update the terminal I/O options for handling the backspace. Hit Backspace for either character (<small>^H</SMALL> or <small>^?</SMALL>) to appear. This is a temporary fix and will have to be done manually every time.</P>
<p>Shells: sh, ksh</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
$ echo &#147;stty erase ^?&#148; &gt&gt .profile
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Shell: csh
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
% echo &#147;stty erase ^H&#148; &gt&gt .cshrc
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>You can append the <small>stty erase</SMALL> option to the end of the startup file of your shell. This way, every time you log in to the system, the startup file executes the command for you. This should be done before the manual <small>stty erase</SMALL> command is entered. If it&#146;s not, you will never be able to get the <small>^?</SMALL> or <small>^H</SMALL> character to appear in your <small>echo</SMALL> statement.</P>
<p>The last option is to create a <small>^?</SMALL> script. You cannot create the script from within an editor, though. When in the editor, the key mapping is controlled by the editor and might map correctly. So here&#146;s how you do it:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
% echo &#147;stty erase ^?&#148; &gt ^?
% chmod 755 ^?
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
