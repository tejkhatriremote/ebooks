<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading15"></A><font color="#000077">6.7.1 Description</FONT></H4>
<p>The <small>find</SMALL> command processes through a system and displays all the files, but <small>find</SMALL> also executes a search through the files with <small>grep</SMALL> to find patterns within files and within subdirectories.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Example One: Searching Recursively</B></FONT></P>
<p>Flavors: AT&ampT, BSD
</P>
<p>Syntax:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
<b>find</B> [dir] <b>-type</B> f <b>-print</B> | <b>xargs</B> grep [-il] [pattern]
<b>find</B> [dir] <b>-type</B> f <b>-exec</B> grep [-il] [pattern] <b>{} \;</B>
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>There are a couple of ways that you can <small>grep</SMALL> through files recursively down subdirectories. This can really be a great benefit when a file contains a piece of code, a record, or information that you are unable to locate. The command uses <small>find</SMALL> to search a directory tree and send the files through <small>grep</SMALL> to search for a matching pattern in each file it locates. In using the <small>find</SMALL> command in combination with <small>grep</SMALL>, you can go through the system and search for every occurrence of the hostname that can exist in a file.</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
rocket 50% find / -type f -print | xargs grep -il planet
/etc/ethers
/etc/hosts
/etc/hostname.le0
/usr/local/bin/sysinfo
/var/adm/messages
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>This <small>find</SMALL> pipes any file it comes across to <small>xargs.</SMALL> The <small>xargs</SMALL> command takes an argument and executes it. In this case, as a file is passed to <small>xargs</SMALL>, a <small>grep</SMALL> is run on the file for the word <i>planet.</I> If the word <i>planet</I> exists in one of the files, the file and its path is displayed. To shorten this recursive <small>grep</SMALL> command even further, add it to your personal alias list:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
alias rgrep    &#145;find . -type f -print | xargs grep -i $1&#145;

rocket 51% rgrep planet
/etc/ethers
/etc/hosts
/etc/hostname.le0
/usr/local/bin/sysinfo
/var/adm/messages
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>By typing <small>rgrep</SMALL> and a search pattern, the pattern is searched in all the files and subdirectories from the current directory you execute the command from.</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
rocket 51% find / -type f -exec grep -il planet {} \;
/etc/ethers
/etc/hosts
/etc/hostname.le0
/usr/local/bin/sysinfo
/var/adm/messages
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>To show multiple ways to perform the same task, this command also processes through a tree or the system and searches for the word <i>planet</I> in every file it comes across. In this version, when every file is found, a <small>grep</SMALL> for the word <i>planet</I> is executed on the file. If the word is found, the filename and path are displayed.</P>
<p>An alias can be set up for this version of the recursive <small>grep</SMALL> as well. This too allows for the command to be entered faster by the administrator and get the results more quickly.</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
alias grep   &#145;find / -type f -exec grep -il $1 {} \;&#146;
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p><font size="+1"><b>Example Two: Removal of Old Files</B></FONT></P>
<p>Flavors: AT&ampT, BSD
</P>
<p>Syntax:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
<b>find</B> [dir] <b>-type</B> f <b>-atime</B> &#43;<i>n</I> <b>-exec rm {} \;</B>
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>To help in cleaning up files, this command can be used to clean up old and unnecessary files. When the <small>find</SMALL> command reaches a file that has not been accessed in <i>n</I> days, the file is removed. If disk space is tight on a disk and you have to find directories to clean up, you typically target the temporary areas first. Users can still occasionally place files vital to their work in this area. So it is best to remove older files first. If a user hasn&#146;t touched a file in <i>n</I> days, it is deemed removable.</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
# find /disk2/tmp -type f -atime &#43;10 -exec rm {} \;
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>This <small>find</SMALL> command progresses through the temporary space on /disk2/tmp and looks for files that have not been accessed in 10 days. If one is found, it then removes it. You do not see anything being output on the display if it finds it. All you should notice is an increase in available disk space. If a large amount of files are still filling up the area, you might need to cut back to a seven-day removal.</P>
<p>You might want to notify your users by sending out periodic notices that files are removed every seven days in the temporary areas. Then you can set this up in the crontab to remove all files in temporary areas every seven days.</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
0 4 * * * find /tmp -type f -atime &#43;7 -exec rm {} \;
2 4 * * * find /var/tmp -type f -atime &#43;7 -exec rm {} \;
5 4 * * * find /diske2/tmp -type f -atime &#43;7 -exec rm {} \;
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p><font size="+1"><b>Reason</B></FONT></P>
<p>Deleting specific files or searching through files can be tedious, especially if it requires searching through multiple directories. It be time consuming if done manually. Having an understanding of how the <small>find</SMALL> command is used can help speed things up for an administrator.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Real World Experience</B></FONT></P>
<p>When setting anything into the <small>crontab</SMALL> that potentially removes large numbers of files, make sure that the entire path is defined for the files that are to be removed. If not, there&#146;s a chance of removing all the files on your system.</P>
<p>In the Eastern United States, a group of programmers and a system administrator spent three days setting up four servers from the West Coast to go into production. The programmers worked feverishly through each night on one machine to get everything in the code right. The plan was to duplicate the system drive off the one server and propagate it to the other servers. By 10:00 the night before the scheduled production date, all was ready to go to production to hundreds of people in the morning. The bugs were thought to be worked out of the programs and the duplicating of the disks to the other three servers began. At 11:30 p.m. the process was all finished.</P>
<p>The programmers spent the next half-hour verifying that all was well for the morning. Everyone was excited that they would be out by midnight. They all started heading for the door when one of the programmers noticed something strange and asked whether anyone knew what was happening. Two of the server disks showed constant activity at exactly the same time and then the two servers crashed. The other two servers were fine. The two that crashed would not even boot to single-user. The third server was halted immediately and stayed down until they could figure out what happened. The fourth server was left up and running to see if they could use it to troubleshoot the problem.</P>
<p>The system administrator began to boot the first server into miniroot from the CDs and, to his surprise, most of the operating system was gone. Because both machines acted exactly the same at midnight he checked the clocks on all the servers. He found that the two that crashed were set to the Eastern timezone and the other two still had the Pacific timezone set. They now believed that they had about two-and-a-half hours left to find the cause before the other two servers crashed.</P>
<p>It appeared that the crash that took place was a timed event. On the fourth server, the system administrator went straight to the <small>crontab</SMALL> and searched for any jobs that started at midnight. There it was. A programmer had an incorrect entry in the <small>crontab</SMALL>:</P>
