<p>The programmers were writing a lot of files out to the system&#146;s temporary directory. They always wanted the files to be deleted whenever the server might have to be rebooted or cleaned up on a nightly basis. The only problem was that they had typed the <small>crontab</SMALL> entry incorrectly. The entry should have read</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
0 0 * * * find /tmp -type f -exec rm {} \;
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>By 1:30 a.m. they had everything the way it should be and ready for production in the morning. All went fairly well in the morning. The moral? Always be careful when automating file deletions.

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading17"></A><font color="#000077">6.8.1 Description</FONT></H4>
<p>System administrators are always working with large groups of files and directories. Moving them around and renaming them doesn&#146;t have to be a difficult task.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Example One: The mv Command</B></FONT></P>
<p>Flavors: AT&ampT, BSD
</P>
<p>Syntax:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
<b>mv</B> [file|dir] [file|dir]
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>The <small>mv</SMALL> command is very commonly used on UNIX systems. Knowing when to use the <small>mv</SMALL> command can make more difficult tasks easy. A normal everyday task of moving a file or a directory from one place to another is made simple for the UNIX administrator. If a newer version of an application or a file is to be used on a system, the old version can be moved out of the way.</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
# mv /usr/local/foo /usr/local/foo.OLD
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>In this case, foo can be a file or a directory. The <small>mv</SMALL> command cannot handle masking or multiple files or directories. When a file or directory is moved across a filesystem, <small>mv</SMALL> must copy the file to the new location first. After this is finished, the <small>mv</SMALL> command removes the original file or directory. If a file or a directory is not moved to another filesystem local or remote to the system, the original name is simply changed to the new name and the inode points to the new name.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>Warning:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Keep in mind that any linking relationshipy where there is a symbolic link to a file or directory that has been moved will be lost.</FONT><hr>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     sys            22 Nov 23 18:09 /var/
<b>&#8658;</B>local/foo -&gt/usr/local/foo
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>If /var/local/foo was linked to /usr/local/foo, the link would be lost because /usr/local/foo was renamed to /usr/local/foo.OLD. Any attempt to change into a directory with a lost link displays an error.
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
# cd /var/local/foo
foo - No such file or directory
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Using the <small>mv</SMALL> command to move a file or directory across NFS mount points can be done. However, better transfer rates can be achieved if the file is copied directly from the local host to a remote host (see section 6.2, &#147;Copy Files Remotely&#148;). Depending on the traffic load of the network, NFS has been known to drop or timeout during a file transfer and this slows the file transfer down.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Example Two: Renaming Files with mv</B></FONT></P>
<p>Flavors: AT&ampT, BSD
</P>
<p>Shells: sh</P>
<p>Although the <small>mv</SMALL> command can be used only on individual files or a specific directory, you can still use the <small>mv</SMALL> command to move or rename a series of files. Use a simple script that processes each file on an individual basis. To rename any type or all the files in a directory from one name to another, use the script <small>rename_all.</SMALL></P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
rocket 52% rename_all *

#!/bin/sh
for i in $*
do
  echo &#147;$i -&gt $i.OLD&#148;
  mv $i $i&#145;.bak
done

<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Line 1: Define the shell to be used by the script.
</P>
<p>Line 2: Process through all the files in the directory.</P>
<p>Line 4: Display the file being renamed and the new name for the file.</P>
<p>Line 6: Move the file to the new filename.</P>
<p>Line 7: Take the next file in the directory until all the files in the directory have been processed.</P>
<p>When the program is executed all you see is the list of current files to be renamed and a pointer to the new filename. If you have a series of old tar files that you want to rename, the <small>rename_all</SMALL> script could change the names of all the <small>tar</SMALL> files.</P>

<p><font size="+1"><b>Example Three: Renaming Uppercase Filenames to Lowercase</B></FONT></P>
<p>Flavors: AT&ampT, BSD
</P>
<p>Shells: sh</P>
<p>In today&#146;s mix of operating systems, there comes a time when files reside on a UNIX system whose name is all in uppercase. Because UNIX is case-sensitive, you generally want to rename all the files to names with lowercase. The <small>mv</SMALL> command makes this an easy process when a script is built around the command.</P>
<p>You can mask any part of the files or use an asterisk (*) to attempt to process all the files in a directory.</P>

   file=&#145;echo $i | tr &#147;[A-Z]&#148; &#147;[a-z]&#148;&#145;

<p>Line 5: Display the current name and the new name that is all lowercase.</P>
<p>Line 6: Rename the current uppercase file to the new lowercase filename that is stored in the variable called <small>file.</SMALL></P>
<p>Line 7: Continue to process the next file until all the files have been converted to lowercase.</P>

<p><font size="+1"><b>Reason</B></FONT></P>
<p>Files can be downloaded or in a state that does not work well in an individual environment. Renaming or moving files is one of the best ways to get various files into the state that is most useful to us.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Real World Experience</B></FONT></P>
<p>With more and more DOS and NT boxes popping up on the network, transferring files can put a file in the wrong case or can limit the number of characters that make up the filename. There is a need for moving or renaming these files into a naming convention that you as UNIX administrators can work with.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Other Resources</B></FONT></P>
<p>Man pages:
</P>
<small>mv, tr</SMALL>
<h3><a name="Heading18"></A><font color="#000077">6.9 Stripping the Man Pages</FONT></H3>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading19"></A><font color="#000077">6.9.1 Description</FONT></H4>
<p>There is a way to strip out all nonessential escape characters to make the man pages more readable.
</P>
<p>Flavors: AT&ampT, BSD</P>
<p>Syntax:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
<b>man</B> - [manpage] | <b>col -b</B> &gt [file]
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>The man pages are extremely useful for learning commands and functions. They can be manipulated depending on the arguments passed to them. If all the escape sequences that are embedded within the man pages are too difficult to interpret by the terminal, there is a way to convert a man page into simple text. If you want to view the <small>tar</SMALL> man page within the vi editor, you normally would take the following steps.</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
rocket 60% man tar &gt /usr/tmp/tar.man
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>Redirect the output of the man pages to the a file so that you can run the editor on it.
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
rocket 61% vi /usr/tmp/tar.man
