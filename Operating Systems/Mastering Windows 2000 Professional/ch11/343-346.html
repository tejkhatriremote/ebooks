</DL>
<p><big><big>I</BIG></BIG>n this chapter, you&#146;ll learn how to use these accessories included with Windows 2000:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Notepad, for reading and writing text files
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Character Map, for entering special symbols
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Imaging, for handling image files
</DL>
<p>Notepad and Character Map are fairly modest programs, but each is genuinely useful in its special niche. The Imaging accessory has a wider variety of possible uses. If you take the time to acquaint yourself with the basic functions of these accessories, you&#146;ll know where to turn when you need help with a problem they can solve.
</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Jotting Down Notes with Notepad</FONT></H3>
<p>Like WordPad, Notepad lets you type and edit text. But the two programs have different missions. You use Notepad for text editing <i>only</I>, whereas you use WordPad to make the text you type look good (that is, to <i>format</I> your text). To use the appropriate jargon, Notepad is a <i>text editor;</I> WordPad is a <i>word processor</I>. (WordPad is covered in Chapter 9, &#147;Using WordPad for Simple Word Processing.&#148;)</P>
<p>In Notepad, you can type text, but you can&#146;t change the fonts; add bold, italics, or color; modify the tab settings; center a paragraph&#151;well, you get the point. So why bother with Notepad? After all, you could type your text in WordPad and simply not use that program&#146;s formatting features.</P>
<p>Notepad&#146;s main advantage over WordPad is that it&#146;s <i>lean</I>&#151;it takes up much less memory than WordPad and it starts up faster, too. It&#146;s small enough to keep open all the time, so you can jot down quick notes whenever you need to. And it&#146;s a perfect tool to call up whenever you need to view a text file.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">Understanding Text Files</FONT></H4>
<p>Notepad can only open and save <i>text-only</I> files&#151;files that contain only text characters. That is, text-only files <i>don&#146;t</I> contain any of the formatting codes used by word processors to store information about the appearance and layout of a document. Text-only files are also known as plain text files, as ASCII or plain ASCII files, or simply as text files, which is what Windows 2000 calls them.</P>
<p><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch11/images/11-01i.jpg"> Before we explain more about text files, here is some practical information: Windows 2000 recognizes a text file as such if it is stored on disk with the filename extension <tt>.txt</TT> or if the extension of the file is associated with Notepad. Files having the <tt>.txt</TT> extension appear in your folders with the text-file icon shown in the margin. This is not to say that you can&#146;t use Notepad to edit text files with extensions other than <tt>.txt</TT>, only that Windows 2000 won&#146;t, by default, display these files with the icon associated with text files.</P>
<p>Text files often have other extensions, however. Note that Windows recognizes files having the <tt>.doc</TT> extension as WordPad documents even if they contain plain text only. You may wish to rename such files to avoid this conflict.</P>
<p>Though text files look fairly boring, they do have some important advantages over fancier, formatted text documents. The most important one is their universality. Text files provide the lowest common denominator for exchanging text between programs and even between different types of computers. Every system has a way to create and display text files. That&#146;s why they remain the medium for most of the e-mail messages passed back and forth on the Internet and other information services, as well as those posted to electronic bulletin boards.</P>
<p>In addition, most programs have text files on the installation disk named something like <tt>read.me</TT>, <tt>readme.txt</TT>, or <tt>readme.doc</TT>. Such files usually contain important information about the software that was added after the manual was printed, including tips on installation, details on new features or bugs in the software, and corrections of errors in the manual. Again, these messages are stored as text-only files so that everyone can read them.</P>
<p>Text files are also good for storing the source code used to generate computer programs. When a programmer writes the source code, he or she types it using a text editor such as Notepad and saves the work in a text file. That way, the instructions needed to create the final program aren&#146;t mixed up with extraneous formatting information that would confuse the compiler (the software that converts the source code into a working program).</P>
<p>You may not be a programmer, but you may sometimes deal with program files of a sort&#151;your system-configuration files, for example, including <tt>win.ini</TT>, <tt>sys.ini</TT>, <tt>protocol.ini</TT>, <tt>config.sys</TT>, and <tt>autoexec.bat</TT>. These text files qualify as programs because they tell your system how to operate. You can edit them with Notepad.</P>
<p>One point to be aware of before proceeding is that Windows 2000 supports <i>Unicode</I> text. Unicode is a type of character set that stores twice as much information as the common character sets we use. The extra storage space is to accommodate languages that have more than 256 characters. When you create a file in Notepad and save it, you have the option to save the file in Unicode format. The only real problem with this is that some programs expect their files to be in ASCII text and don&#146;t understand Unicode.</P>
<p>If you want to save a file in Unicode format, select Unicode from the Encoding drop-down list box in Notepad&#146;s Save As dialog, shown below.</P>

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading4"></A><font color="#000077">Reviewing Notepad&#146;s Limitations</FONT></H4>
<p>Just so you won&#146;t use Notepad for the wrong tasks, here&#146;s a summary of its limitations:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It has no paragraph- or character-formatting capabilities. It can wrap lines of text to fit the size of the window, however, which is a nice feature.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It supports only text files. Notepad can&#146;t open formatted documents created with WordPad, Microsoft Word for Windows, WordPerfect, or any other word processor (actually, it <i>can</I> open the files, but they won&#146;t look right).
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn&#146;t have any fancy pagination options, although it will print with headers and footers via the Page Setup dialog box.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Previous versions of Notepad (including the one that shipped with Windows 9<i>x</I>) could not open files that exceeded about 50K in size. Fortunately, the Notepad included with Windows 2000 does not have this limitation. This version can open files of any size, limited only by the amount of (virtual) memory available.<hr></FONT>
