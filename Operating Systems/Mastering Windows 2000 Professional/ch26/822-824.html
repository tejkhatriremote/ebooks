<p>Once logged on to the network, remote users can use the network just like any other users can, depending on their user rights. When remote users access files, they work on them at the remote computer, accessing the file server only to save the file or get a new one. Therefore, if you are running Windows or GUI applications, remote access is faster than remote control. Of course, local users will still be able to access files on the server more quickly than remote users will because remote users must use slow telephone lines for transmission instead of fast network cable. Speed&#151;or lack of it&#151;is more or less of a problem depending on the size of the file. When accessing an 11K memo, the extra access time is no big deal. Accessing a 1MB book, however, will take even longer over the telephone than it does over the LAN. At least the GUI application screen needn&#146;t travel through the phone lines along with the data.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading6"></A><font color="#000077">Deciding Which Is Better&#151;Remote Control or Remote Access</FONT></H4>
<p>When the time comes for you to decide between remote control and remote access, consider the following points:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the user&#146;s requirements? Which applications is the user running and what work does the user do?
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What hardware is compatible and what is your computer&#146;s memory capacity?
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How will each option work with your LAN?
</DL>
<p>Essentially, when choosing between remote control and remote access, you&#146;re stuck with a choice between downloading screens (no big deal for DOS applications, but worth noting for Windows) and downloading files. No matter how you slice it, at this point telecommuting is still slower than working in the office.
</P>
<p>One option is not to make a choice&#151;many companies use remote control in some situations and remote access in other situations.</P>
<p>Dial-Up Networking is the same as the Remote Access Service (RAS) with which you are familiar if you have used Windows for Workgroups 3.1<i>x</I> or Windows NT. Dial-Up Networking in Windows 95 is more powerful and flexible than Windows for Workgroups RAS, but not as complete as the Windows NT RAS. Windows 2000 has an updated version of the Dial-Up Networking from Windows 9<i>x</I>. It includes the functionality present in NT 4, and Windows 98, plus a newer version of the Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI).</P>
<p>Next we discuss the two aspects of Dial-Up Networking&#151;the dial-up server and the dial-up client.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading7"></A><font color="#000077">Using the Hardware: Modems</FONT></H3>
<p>The most common piece of telecommuting hardware is a modem. Yes, you can get ISDN links in most major metro areas, and other data communications options that require other hardware are available (e.g., Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), cable, frame relay, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)), but most telecommuters are going to spend that $120 to get a 56Kbps modem from Jeff and Jane&#146;s Computer Hut rather than try to get ISDN from the telephone company.
</P>
<p>A modem (MOdulator/DEModulator) works like a translator, converting the computer&#146;s digital signals into analog signals for the phone lines (analog lines don&#146;t speak digital, and most local telephone lines are analog), and then reconverting those analog signals to digital signals for the computer on the other end. The two computers connected by the modem can talk to each other, but the transport medium (the telephone line) can&#146;t speak their language. Therefore, the modems are necessary to first put the data in a form that can be transferred over the telephone line and then convert the data back to a form that the computer can understand.</P>
<p>Not all modems can talk to each other, and the faster the modem, the more limited the field is. For modems to communicate, they must use compatible protocols for modulation, error control, and data compression. In the following sections, we explain each of these protocols in detail and list the standard protocols available for each one. The <i>de facto</I> standard for telecommuting modems is currently about 33.6Kbps, so this discussion is limited to modems of that speed and faster.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading8"></A><font color="#000077">Definitions</FONT></H4>
<p>Here are some terms that you need to know to follow this discussion on modems:
</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>High-speed modem</B>
<dd>A modem with a speed of 33.6Kbps or faster.
<dt><b>Half duplex</B>
<dd>The same communication channel is used for both sending and receiving, so only one or the other can happen at any given time, sort of like using a walkie-talkie and having to say &#147;over&#148; when you finish transmitting.
<dt><b>Full duplex</B>
<dd>Two communication channels enable you to send and receive data simultaneously, much more like a real conversation where you can speak and listen at the same time.
</DL>

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading9"></A><font color="#000077">Modulation Protocols</FONT></H4>
<p>As stated earlier, a modem acts as a translator between the computer and the phone line, changing digital signals to analog signals, and vice versa. This translation takes place according to the modem&#146;s modulation protocol. Modulation protocols establish the &#147;ground rules,&#148; like countries settling the way in which their negotiation will be carried out before actually beginning the negotiation.
</P>
<p>Modulation protocols establish these basic rules of communication:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Parity checking
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bit synchronization
</DL>
<p>These rules of communication determine both how data is translated and how fast it will be transferred between modems. The major modulation protocols follow.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>V.32 bis</B></FONT></P>
<p>Many 9600bps modems use a modulation protocol called V.32, which is a full-duplex protocol. The next modulation protocol established by the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT&#151;it&#146;s French) was V.32 bis, which became the standard for 14.4 modems. V.32 bis has the advantage over V.32 for a couple of reasons, mostly its error correction and compression.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>V.34</B></FONT></P>
<p>Called <i>V.Terbo</I> until the spring of 1993, this fast protocol accomplishes an uncompressed line speed of 19,200bps. The protocol called <i>V.Fast</I>, which is a variation of V.34, will perform speeds of 28,800bps&#151;but some phone lines are too noisy to support such high speeds.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>V.90</B></FONT></P>
<p>This is the most recent addition to the list and describes the new 56Kbps standard. V.90 is the common ground between the two competing standards for 56K service, Kflex 56 and X2, and is now widely supported.
