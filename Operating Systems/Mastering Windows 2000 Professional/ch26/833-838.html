<p>You can set the following parameters for this connection from the Modem Configuration dialog box:
</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Maximum Speed</B>
<dd>Sets the maximum transmission speed for the modem connection, just as the name implies. Keep this setting high, as your modem can occasionally go faster than its rated speed if the line conditions are particularly good.
<dt><b>Modem Protocol</B>
<dd>This setting is dependent on the type of modem installed. It enables you to choose whether the modem will use error correction, force error correction, or disable error correction altogether.
<dt><b>Enable Hardware Flow Control</B>
<dd>Enables handshaking between the modem and the computer so that if the modem falls behind in receiving, it can halt the flow of data rather than just register an overflow error. In short, keeping this option enabled allows the modem to slow its eating speed rather than choke.
<dt><b>Enable Modem Error Control</B>
<dd>Enables error checking through cyclical redundancy checks (CRCs). This option increases modem efficiency because it eliminates the need for start and stop bits (bits that signal the beginning and end of data transmission).
<dt><b>Enable Modem Compression</B>
<dd>Enables your modem to compress the data stream using the V.42 bis compression algorithm. This option is not checked by default, but we recommend checking it. Not all modems support compression, which is probably why this setting is disabled by default. Most high-speed modems <i>do</I> support compression nowadays, however, so it&#146;s probably a safe bet to enable compression. Just as data-compression programs such as Stacker work better on some kinds of files than others, the amount of compression that takes place depends on how much redundancy is in the data transmission, which varies with the type of transmission.
<dt><b>Enable Modem Speaker</B>
<dd>Enables the modem to work silently or to keep you informed of every beep and squawk. This setting is pretty self-explanatory: With a check in the box, every squeal and grunt from the modem is broadcast through its speaker.
<dt><b>Initialization</B>
<dd>This section contains two settings that control the startup of the connection. The first option asks if you want to Show Terminal Window when you connect. This would enable you to enter special commands when connecting. The other option, Run Script, lets you specify a script that contains all of those commands you would run from the terminal window during connection.
</DL>

<p><font size="+1"><b>Options Tab</B></FONT></P>
<p>The Options tab of the connection Properties dialog box sets the basic behavior of the computer while it&#146;s trying to connect. This tab is shown in Figure 26.4.
</P>
<p><a name="Fig4"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch26/images/26-04.jpg',367,443)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch26/images/26-04t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch26/images/26-04.jpg',367,443)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 26.4</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Options tab lets you control dialing options.</P>
<p>The configuration settings include:
</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Display Progress While Connecting</B>
<dd>Keeps you informed of the progress of the connection while the modem is dialing the server.
<dt><b>Prompt For Name and Password, Certificate, Etc.</B>
<dd>Specifies whether you will be prompted for credentials before connecting; this includes your user name, password, and certificate if you are using something like a smart card for additional security.
<dt><b>Prompt For and Include Windows Logon Domain</B>
<dd>This will eliminate one of the most annoying glitches when dialing the Internet. In NT 4, you would be prompted for a user name, password, and domain name every time you dialed your connection. If you were dialing an ISP and supplying a domain name, the ISP (frequently a Unix computer) would hang up because it didn&#146;t understand the domain name. If you are dialing an ISP, you can simply uncheck this box to prevent this from happening.
<dt><b>Prompt For Phone Number</B>
<dd>Determines whether you will be prompted for the phone number prior to dialing the connection.
<dt><b>Redialing Options</B>
<dd>This area of the tab includes settings that control how the line will be redialed if it is busy or there is no answer. You can make settings that determine how many redial attempts will be made, how many seconds will pass between each attempt, and idle time before the modem will hang up.
<dt><b>X.25</B>
<dd>This button opens the properties sheet for your X.25 connection.
</DL>

<p><font size="+1"><b>Security Tab</B></FONT></P>
<p>The Security tab of the connection Properties dialog box is shown in Figure 26.5.
</P>
<p><a name="Fig5"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch26/images/26-05.jpg',367,443)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch26/images/26-05t.jpg"></A>

<p>The Security tab contains the following settings:
</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Security Options</B>
<dd>Contains settings for the different types of logon validation that are supported by Windows 2000. The Typical Settings include the standard validation schemes ranging from Allow Unsecured Password to Use Smartcard. The Advanced Settings includes the ability to further customize the encryption protocols used to log on to this connection.
<dt><b>Interactive Logon and Scripting</B>
<dd>Includes settings to enable you to open a terminal window to perform your logon, and to use a logon script.
</DL>

<p>The Advanced Settings enables you to select multiple forms of logon encryption as shown in Figure 26.6. Two of these options, PAP and CHAP, are used commonly by Microsoft operating systems and are discussed below.
</P>
<p><a name="Fig6"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch26/images/26-06.jpg',374,435)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch26/images/26-06t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch26/images/26-06.jpg',374,435)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 26.6</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Advanced Settings option enables you to select from many logon encryption methods.</P>
<p><b>Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The first level of security is established during the connection. If you have selected PPP as your server type on both the client and the server, then you can utilize a technology known as the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP). Before PAP, the server, client, and user held the following conversation:</P>
<dl>
<dd>Server (to Client): Do you use PAP?
<dd>Client (to Server): No.
<dd>Server (to Client): What is the user&#146;s name?
<dd>Client (to User): What is your logon name?
<dd>User (to Client): Frank.
<dd>Client (to Server): The user says his name is Frank.
<dd>Server (to Client): Great, what is the user&#146;s password?
<dd>Client (to User): What is your logon password?
<dd>User (to Client): Doghouse.
<dd>Client (to Server): The client says his password is <i>doghouse</I>.
<dd>Server (to Client): Thank you.
</DL>
<p>This conversation would take place every time the user wanted to log on to the network remotely; no encryption of information is being sent back and forth. With some network servers, you may have to create a script file to automate this conversation. In either case, the network administrator has to understand how to create the script file. Scripts in theory are very straightforward, but the actual syntax can vary from hardware device to hardware device and from network operating system to network operating system.
