<p><big><big>O</BIG></BIG>ne of the fastest growing segments of the computer industry involves the use of notebook computers. More and more business people are taking advantage of the portability and power that these lightweight computers have to offer. Business people can spend more time out of the office while staying connected to the office and the information that it contains. These people are telecommuting&#151;performing computer functions they would usually do in the office at a remote location via telephone and digital lines.</P>
<p>Which leads us to the topic of this chapter&#151;Dial-Up Networking (DUN). In NT, Microsoft referred to this service as the <i>Remote Access Service</I>. The problem with the term Remote Access Service is that it means different things to different people and industries. So Microsoft has changed the name to Dial-Up Networking, a name the company started using in Windows 95. In addition, if you walk up to an average consumer and ask, &#147;Do you do remote access?&#148; their eyes will glaze over and they might not have any idea of what you are talking about. However, if you ask the same person, &#147;Do you do Dial-Up Networking?&#148; they may realize that yes, they dial up to CompuServe and America Online, and yes, it would be &#147;way cool&#148; to be able to dial up their office network from home or a hotel.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>In Windows 2000, like Windows NT 4, Remote Access Service refers to the server portion and Dial-Up Networking refers to the client portion. They are actually the same service; the terms simply separate the functions.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>In this chapter, we refer to your generic office network as the <i>network</I> and to your home or portable computer as the <i>remote computer</I> or the <i>dial-up</I> computer. (We use this terminology even though many people are using Dial-Up Networking to dial up their East Coast office from their West Coast office or to provide gateways to other parts of their network.)</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Defining Remote Access</FONT></H3>
<p><i>Remote access</I> is a general term that means the ability to access a network from a remote or distant location via modems, fiber-optic lines, and/or satellites. You can perform this function in two primary ways: via remote access software or remote control software.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">Understanding the Difference between Remote Control and Remote Access</FONT></H3>
<p>After you&#146;ve made the decision to telecommute, you need to decide whether to do so using <i>remote control</I> or <i>remote access</I>. Both methods have similar hardware requirements: a modem, a telephone line, and a PC somewhere outside of the office. The difference between remote control and remote access lies in the way in which the telecommuter accesses the office network. Thus, the method you choose depends on the kind of work that you will be doing and the software that you use to do it.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading4"></A><font color="#000077">Remote Control</FONT></H4>
<p><i>Remote control computing</I> is a method of telecommuting in which the remote user uses a network computer, controlling it via modem from his or her remote location. This kind of telecommuting requires a modem, a phone line, remote control software, a remote PC, and a host PC, which is an office workstation specifically designated for dial-in use by the remote user.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>The Puppet Master</B></FONT></P>
<p>Remote control enables the remote user to take control of the host PC in the office via modem. The remote PC works as a front end for the remote user, letting her key in data and see the results on her monitor, but the only things traveling between the central office and the remote office are input and output. All the work is being done by the host PC&#151;it has the applications, its processor is performing the calculations, and so forth. The remote PC does not need any of the necessary applications on it; it just uses the host machine&#146;s copies.
</P>
<p>Remote control is best for non-GUI applications that use large amounts of data. It becomes much slower if you are running graphics-intensive programs, such as Windows or any Windows application. To get around this problem, some remote control software (such as ReachOut from Ocean Isle Software) transmits only GUI screen <i>changes</I> to the remote PC. This technique cuts down on traffic, at least in theory.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Disadvantages</B></FONT></P>
<p>In addition to its slowness under Windows, remote control has a few other disadvantages:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The telecommuter needs more than one PC&#151;the remote PC and the host PC.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The system needs extra cabling management, power, cooling, and space.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The remote user cannot reset the host machine if it locks up.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The host machine is also used as a workstation.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The office machine is logged on to the network, which can raise security concerns.
</DL>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading5"></A><font color="#000077">Remote Access</FONT></H4>
<p>Remote access makes the remote PC a node on the network rather than the controller of a network PC. The remote PC does all the processing. It&#146;s also a good idea for the remote PC to have all the applications that it will need on its hard drive, which keeps the data transfer to a minimum.
</P>
<p>Communication from a remote node to a network requires a modem, a phone line, a remote PC, and remote access software on both ends of the connection. In effect, remote access makes the remote PC a node on the office LAN. The phone line acts as a cable that connects the remote PC to the Network Interface Card at the office. To log on to the network, remote users dial up the remote access server (which may or may not be the same computer as the file server). Once connected, remote users must log on to the network just as they would if they were using one of the office PCs. (The security measures involved vary from product to product.)</P><p><br></P>
