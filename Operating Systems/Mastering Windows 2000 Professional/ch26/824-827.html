<p><font size="+1"><b>Other Modulation Protocols</B></FONT></P>
<p>Other modulation protocols are on the market, as modems typically support not only the standard modulation protocols but also the modulation protocols of different manufacturers. Realizing that connectivity is the name of the game (a modem that can&#146;t talk to other modems doesn&#146;t even make a good paperweight), most modem manufacturers work together to make sure that other modems support their protocols.
</P>
<p>However, some modem manufacturers use proprietary modulation protocols:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;US Robotics HST
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Telebit PEP and Turbo PEP
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hayes Express 96
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;CompuCom CSP
</DL>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading10"></A><font color="#000077">Error-Correcting Protocols</FONT></H4>
<p>You know that eight bits makes a byte, and that one byte equals one ASCII character. The identity of that ASCII character depends on the arrangement of those bits, which explains why error control and error correction are so important. Without any way of making sure that what goes into the modem is what comes out on the other side, the data can get corrupted by noise on the telephone lines scrambling the bits in the data being transmitted. The letters in the original file may not be what comes through on the other end of the modem connection. When you are buying a modem, be sure to choose one with an error-correcting protocol.
</P>
<p>Although the mechanics of error-control protocols are complex and beyond the scope of this book, a modem checks for errors in two main ways:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends all data twice and checks to make sure that the copies match.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Performs one of various mathematical functions with the bytes in the data, both before and after transmittal. If the results of the functions match on both ends, the data is presumably okay.
</DL>
<p>The first method isn&#146;t bad, but it&#146;s not foolproof; if line noise can mess up data once, it can certainly do so twice. The second method is, therefore, more reliable. In this method, after the data passes muster, the extra bits created by the function are discarded.
</P>
<p>The two most widely used error-control protocols&#151;MNP 4 and V.42&#151;<i>correct</I> errors.</P>
<p>What about throughput? In addition to maintaining your data&#146;s integrity, these error-correcting protocols can speed up data transfer slightly. In addition to the eight bits in a character, a character also carries the baggage of a start bit and a stop bit, which indicate the beginning and end of the bits defining the character. When two modems use V.42 and/or MNP 4 (described in the paragraphs that follow), they strip off the start bit and stop bit during transmission and reattach them on the other end. This step doesn&#146;t increase throughput much, but it&#146;s nice to know that error-correcting doesn&#146;t slow things down.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>MNP 4</B></FONT></P>
<p>MNP stands for Microcom Network Protocols. MNP 2 through MNP 4 error-control protocols exist, but MNP 4 is the most widely used. Because no one but Microcom had developed any other error-correcting protocols, MNP 4 was for some time the <i>de facto</I> standard in the industry. This status changed with the introduction of V.42.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>V.42</B></FONT></P>
<p>V.42 was established by the CCITT in 1988. This protocol actually uses two error-control schemes. Link access procedure for modems (LAP-M) is its primary error-control protocol, but it uses MNP 4 when it is unable to make a connection with LAP-M. Thus, a modem using V.42 is able to sustain an error-free connection with a modem using only MNP 4.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading11"></A><font color="#000077">Data-Compression Protocols</FONT></H4>
<p>Data-compression protocols define the way in which the sending modem compresses data and the way in which the receiving modem decompresses it. Modems that compress data must also have error-checking capabilities (in case the data gets corrupted in the compression/decompression process). You can arrange for the transmittal of compressed data either through compressing modems, compression software, buffers, or local flow control.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Data compression is not always the fastest way to send data, oddly enough. As you&#146;ll see, sometimes it can slow things down.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Modem-Based Protocols</B></FONT></P>
<p>The modem-based protocols are MNP 5 and V.42 bis. MNP 5 works in combination with the error-controlling protocol MNP 4. It has a maximum compression rate of 2:1, but it is kind of stupid about the way in which it treats already-compressed files such as <tt>.zip</TT> files. It tries to recompress the already compressed files and thus slows transmission while achieving no real purpose.</P>
<p>Developed in 1989, V.42 bis is a somewhat better data-compression protocol than MNP 5. In addition to data compression, V.42 bis has the error-correcting abilities of V.42, so your modem does not require both protocols. Its maximum compression ratio is 4:1, and it is more efficient than MNP 5 because it dynamically deletes any unusable strings and does not try to recompress already compressed files.</P>
<p>On-the-fly data compression sounds good, but you need to look out for a few things when considering a modem that uses data compression:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all data that the modem will be working with can be compressed. Files stored in many graphics formats are already compressed, as are many program files and the common <tt>.zip</TT> files that you see on the Internet and communications services. Data compression does nothing for them and can, in fact, waste some time.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Vendors of modems with data compression have a tendency to be a bit, well, optimistic in their estimation of exactly how effective the compression will be. For example, some modem ads nowadays claim to transfer 57,000bps on a regular dial-up line. This claim is patently impossible; Shannon&#146;s Law tells us that what these &#147;57K&#148; modems are really offering is a modem that transfers data at 14,400bps and compresses the data. If the data-compression routines can compress data over a 3:1 ratio, then the net transfer rate will, indeed, be 57,000bps. But because most data will not compress, you&#146;ll just end up paying a lot of money for a 14,400bps modem. Look closely at any product that claims to be a 38,000bps or 57,000bps modem.
