<h3><a name="Heading14"></A><font color="#000077">Setting Up Domain and Administrator Accounts</FONT></H3>
<p>To become members of a domain, workstations must get machine accounts on a domain from the Primary Domain Controller in one of three ways:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A machine account can be created on the server by a domain administrator using the Active Directory Users and Computers Management Console.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;On a workstation, a domain administrator can create a machine account through the System applet in the Control Panel.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The workstation Setup program provides an administrator with the option of creating a machine account during Windows 2000 Professional installation.
</DL>
<p>This process can be a little confusing, so let&#146;s look at it in a little more detail. Most operating systems allow workstations to access an NT or Windows 2000 domain without prior notice. For example, Windows, Windows 9<i>x</I>, DOS, OS/2, or Windows for Workgroups computers can appear on a Windows 2000 domain without the permission of the Windows 2000 Domain Controller. That is, they can as long as whoever is logging on to the Windows 2000 domain is a user with a valid network account created with the Active Directory Users and Computers Management Console.</P>
<p>Conversely, a Windows 2000 domain won&#146;t recognize a Windows 2000 workstation that it hasn&#146;t been &#147;introduced to.&#148; Generally, you can introduce a workstation to a domain by first logging on to the domain as an administrator and running the Server Manager. In the Users and Computers console, you can add a workstation to the domain. When you install the next Windows 2000 workstation, you would give that computer the same name as the machine you added with the Active Directory Users and Computers Management Console. The domain would accept this name because it is already waiting for the computer to join.</P>
<p>If you forget to run the Users and Computers Management Console before installing your workstation, you will have to abandon installing the workstation or try to find a machine that can run the console. Microsoft decided to make your life a little easier by adding a small piece of the Users and Computers tool to the Setup program. If you are a domain administrator and you&#146;re installing Windows 2000 Professional, you can create the machine account in the domain during the installation process.</P>
<p>During the portion of Setup when you are asked if the computer will participate in a domain, you&#146;re prompted to enter a username and a password. You may think that the Setup program is prompting you to create a new user; it&#146;s not. The name and password that you&#146;re entering are for a domain account that has administrative privileges, which will allow you to create a machine account in the domain. After you are finished, click OK.</P>
<p>In addition, administrators can create machine accounts from the workstation after installation. All you have to do is go to the System applet in the Control Panel and use the Network Identification tab to tell Windows 2000 that you want to add your computer to the domain. Normally, you would use this method if the domain&#146;s name has changed or you want to change the computer from one domain to another.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Adding new machine accounts after installation does not delete the original machine account from the domain. It just adds another account, leaving the old one intact.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading15"></A><font color="#000077">Re-Creating Windows 2000 Workstation Machine Accounts</FONT></H4>
<p>The need to re-create machine accounts on a workstation depends upon whether you have reinstalled Windows 2000 Server or Windows 2000 Professional. If you&#146;ve reinstalled Windows 2000 Professional with the same name that it had prior to reinstallation, you won&#146;t have to worry about making any changes to the machine account. The workstation and the domain will be able to recognize each other without any problems. In essence, the workstation gives itself a name that the domain is already looking for. It&#146;s as if the domain is saying, &#147;Is anyone out there named W2kP4?&#148; and the workstation, when it first establishes the network connection during reinstallation, says &#147;Here I am!&#148; The connection to the domain is established.
</P>
<p>Suppose, however, that you want your computer to have a different name. Changing names on a workstation can cause a minor headache because the domain knows your workstation by the old name instead of the new one, even though in all other respects it is the same machine. Fortunately, this problem is easy to fix, as outlined in the following section.</P><p><br></P>
