<p><font size="+1"><b>End User License Agreement</B></FONT></P>
<p>If you are starting Setup from floppy disks, you will see the End User License Agreement, or EULA, as it&#146;s often called. If you are performing a floppyless install, you&#146;ve already sent the license and won&#146;t see it here. It is a good idea to read through the license at least once, though you won&#146;t want to read it every time. Basically, it tells you not to pirate the software, and how many computers you can install it on. When you feel that you&#146;ve read enough to make a decision, press the F8 key to agree with the license. If you do not agree with the license, press the Esc key at any time to cancel the setup. If you don&#146;t agree with the license, you may want to pack everything up and return it to the store where you purchased it. But where&#146;s the fun in that? The next screen will prompt you for your 25-character license key. This code can be found on the back of your CD-ROM case for Windows 2000 Professional.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Where to Put Windows 2000</B></FONT></P>
<p>Now you can choose where to put Windows 2000 Professional on your hard disk. You can choose to put it in a partition already created on your disk, or Setup will partition an unpartitioned space for you. You must have at least 650MB of unused space on either a partitioned or unpartitioned area. If you have another operating system, it is more convenient and efficient to install Windows 2000 and its applications onto a separate partition or another hard drive if you have one.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Locating and maintaining Windows 2000 and its applications is easier if you keep them separate from other operating systems. Of course, you are not obligated to do so if space doesn&#146;t permit.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Formatting an Unpartitioned Space</B></FONT></P>
<p>If you choose to install Windows 2000 onto an unpartitioned space, just pick the space and Setup partitions and assign a drive letter to it. Highlight that new space and continue with the installation. You can also choose to delete a partition at this screen, which enables you to reorganize your disk if necessary.
</P>

<table border="2" bordercolor="#0000" align="CENTER">
<tr><td><font size="+1"><b>File System Type and the Formatting of Space</B></FONT>
<p>If you are partitioning free space, you must select either an NTFS or File Allocation Table (FAT) system for that space. NTFS was designed specifically for use with Windows NT and Windows 2000. The main differences between NTFS and the FAT system used by DOS are
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;NTFS supports filenames of up to 255 characters (including spaces and periods), with multiple extensions; FAT on Windows 2000 supports filenames of up to 255 characters including the full path.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;NTFS is designed with system security in mind, providing features such as auditing and built-in file-level permissions; FAT has no file system security.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;NTFS supports larger volumes up to a practical limit of 2 terabytes and a theoretical limit of 16 exabytes (EB). FAT supports only 2GB partitions on MS-DOS and Windows 9<i>x</I>, and 4GB on Windows 2000.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;NTFS supports file auditing; FAT does not.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;NTFS is more efficient on larger disks than FAT, and supports a larger partition size (16EB per partition).
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;NTFS keeps a log of activities in order to be able to restore the disk after a power failure or other interruptions in service; FAT is not able to do this.
</DL>
<p>If you choose to install Windows 2000 on a FAT file system, you have the option of converting the partition to NTFS before installing to that virtual drive. Be aware, though, that conversion to NTFS is a one-way affair. There is no going back to FAT without re-partitioning and formatting. You also need to decide if you want to install to the Winnt folder. If you don&#146;t, type in the name of the folder you wish.
</P>
</TABLE>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>This point in Setup is one of the few places that you can delete an NTFS partition. If you ever need to remove an NTFS partition, you can run Setup to this point and choose to delete the partition and create a new partition. You can also delete an NTFS partition by using either Disk Administrator in Windows 2000 or Fdisk from MS-DOS 6.2 or higher. In Fdisk you choose to delete a non-DOS partition.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Installation Continues</B></FONT></P>
<p>As the installation continues, Setup prompts you to restart the computer. You advance through the license agreement and then a series of informational screens before getting to the Setup Preferences window.
</P>
<p>The Plug-and-Play device detection occurs at this point. While the detection is happening, your screen may flicker for a few seconds. Windows 2000 will detect and load drivers for all of your supported hardware. It&#146;s possible that it won&#146;t have drivers for something in your computer, but you can always install the drivers after setup has completed.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Regional Settings</B></FONT></P>
<p>The Regional Settings dialog box enables you to define the configuration of things like the keyboard layout, date, time, and currency formats.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Name and Organization</B></FONT></P>
<p>On this dialog box, you need to enter your full name and the name of your organization. If you are uncertain what to enter here, you should check with your network administrator for the policy. If this Windows 2000 computer is to be used at home, you can enter anything you want in these spaces.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Computer Name and Administrator Password</B></FONT></P>
<p>The name that you choose for your computer is arbitrary but necessary for identification. You can name it anything you like as long as that name isn&#146;t being used by another computer connected to the same domain. Our advice, however, is to avoid using the name of the person currently using the workstation. Two years from now the computer may still be in use, but it would be confusing for Joe, Martin, and Laura to all have been using Bobscomputer, while Bob himself has long since moved to another office&#151;and now uses Lynnscomputer.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Keep in mind that computer names are limited to 15 characters on network protocols other than TCP/IP. If you have TCP/IP installed on Windows 2000, you can have names up to 63 characters in length, but they won&#146;t be visible from other operating systems. You can use spaces in the names, but this may cause problems with older network operating systems such as Windows for Workgroups.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>In this same dialog box, there is a prompt to set the password for the local Administrator account. You will need to type it into the space provided, and then type it again to confirm it. The passwords in Windows 2000 can be up to 256 characters in length, allowing for some <i>very</I> secure user accounts.</P>
<p>Remember that the administrator administers this machine only, not the domain (that is, if you&#146;re a domain member). As the local Administrator, you can choose any password&#151;it doesn&#146;t have to be the same as your Domain Administrator account, and for security purposes it shouldn&#146;t be the same. User accounts and users with Administrator permissions can be added to the workgroup after Setup is complete.</P><p><br></P>
