<p>Earlier in this chapter, we described the process to change your domain or workgroup membership using the Network Identification Wizard. In this section we&#146;ll take a look at the other method of changing this information using the Network Identification tab of System Properties.
</P>
<p>If you want to change your computer&#146;s name, go to the Control Panel and then follow these steps:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the System applet and click the Network Identification tab, as shown in Figure 20.3.

<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reboot your computer and return to the Network Identification tab via the System applet in Control Panel.
<dd><b>6.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Advanced button.
<dd><b>7.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the radio button next to Domain and enter the name of the domain. Click the OK button.
<dd><b>8.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Restart your computer for the settings to take effect.
</DL>
<p>The reason you have to change your workstation to a workgroup and then back to a domain is that you are changing the name of the computer on that workstation only. The domain still knows your computer by its old name, not the one that it has now. For your workstation to become part of the domain again, you have to remove the old name from the domain, change the name of the workstation, and then add the workstation, with its new name, to the domain.
</P>
<p>The domain assigns invisible internal passwords to the workstations. The Primary Domain Controller uses these passwords to verify that a machine is who it says it is. As a result, if you reinstall Windows 2000 Professional on a machine that was already running Windows 2000 and you assign the same name to the computer that it was previously using, you&#146;ll get the following message: &#147;No domain controller was available to validate your logon.&#148;</P>
<p>This warning is an essential security feature of Windows 2000. In essence, the domain&#146;s reasoning is something like this: &#147;Even though you say that you&#146;re a machine named NTWS4 and I know of a machine named NTWS4, how do I know that you&#146;re that machine?&#148; Similarly, we use identification badges, numbers, or fingerprints to distinguish ourselves from one another and also to prove to others that we are who we say we are. For example, the only way we could distinguish one person named John Smith from another John Smith is to give each John Smith a unique social security number, driver&#146;s license, and the like. Without these unique identifiers, we&#146;d have no idea if someone was really who they said they were. The same goes for computers. A computer needs special identification in order for the domain to identify that workstation named NTWS4 from all other computers with the same name.</P>
<p>Because of these identification requirements, you have to follow three steps to reinstall Windows 2000 Professional on a computer:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut down the computer on which you are going to reinstall Windows 2000.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Log on the domain as an administrator, run the Users and Computers console, and delete the to-be-reinstalled workstation from the domain.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reinstall Windows 2000 Professional, specifying that you are not upgrading but rather are replacing the Windows 2000 software on the machine. In the process of reinstallation, you are given the chance to create a new machine account on the domain. Create the new machine account, and you are up and running.
</DL>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading17"></A><font color="#000077">Deleting a Workstation Account from a Domain</FONT></H4>
<p>In the course of writing this book, we discovered many ways of how <i>not</I> to do things. One problem we had was figuring out how to delete a workstation from the domain while the workstation was still connected to the domain. We thought, &#147;Oh, well. Maybe we can just create a new account with the same name.&#148; Using the Users and Computers console, we created the new machine account, but neither the workstation nor the domain could recognize one another. The message we received looked like the following:</P>
<p><a name="Fig7"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch20/images/20-07.jpg',401,113)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch20/images/20-07t.jpg"></A></P>
<p>You can guess why this message appeared. Instead of assigning the old machine account to the workstation, the domain created an entirely new account with the same name. When we then tried to access the domain from the old workstation account, we were turned down because the domain didn&#146;t recognize the old domain account.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The difference between reinstalling a workstation to a domain and deleting a workstation account from a domain is that when you reinstall a workstation, the domain re-creates the machine account for the workstation under the same name. However, when the machine account is deleted while a workstation is using it, the domain has to create an entirely new account because the workstation is still using the old one.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The process for restoring a machine account is very similar to changing the computer&#146;s name. If you have deleted a workstation account from the domain before shutting down your workstation, you need to do the following in the domain:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the System applet in the Control Panel and click the Network Identification tab.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Advanced.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the radio button next to Workgroup and click OK.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reboot and go back to the System applet.
<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Network Identification tab and click Advanced.
<dd><b>6.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the radio button next to Domain and input the name of the domain. Click OK.
<dd><b>7.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reboot, and your workstation should be back as part of the domain.
</DL>
<h3><a name="Heading18"></A><font color="#000077">Repairing Windows 2000 Professional</FONT></H3>
<p>If you encounter a problem with getting Windows 2000 to run properly, you may have some damaged system files, or perhaps you accidentally deleted or damaged a few crucial files and don&#146;t feel like sitting through another half-hour installation. If this is the case, repairing Windows 2000 is much more convenient than reinstalling it because the repair process is fairly easy to complete.
</P>
<p>Before attempting to repair Windows 2000, make sure that you have two things: a Windows 2000 CD-ROM and an emergency repair disk. (Now is the time to use the emergency repair disk you made when you first installed Windows 2000.) What, you didn&#146;t make one? Well, you can also use the Backup utility on your workstation to create a new Emergency Repair Disk. See the next section on how to do this.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Keep in mind that the emergency repair disk will work only on the workstation from which it was created. The disk contains the configuration and Registry information for a specific machine. Therefore, it can&#146;t be used to repair other workstations.<hr></FONT>
