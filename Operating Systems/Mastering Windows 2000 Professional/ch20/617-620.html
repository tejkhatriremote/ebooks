<p><font size="+1"><b>Date and Time</B></FONT></P>
<p>The Date and Time Settings dialog box enables you to select the correct time and date, obviously, but it also has settings for the correct time zone for your location. Setup will read the time and date settings from the computer&#146;s BIOS, and will display those settings as the suggested configuration. If they aren&#146;t right, the up and down arrows will adjust them to the desired setting.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Networking Settings</B></FONT></P>
<p>Windows 2000 will detect the network card and install default components. The default components include the Client for Microsoft Networks, File and Print Sharing for Microsoft Networks, and the TCP/IP protocol with automatic addressing. You can select to install the network with Custom Settings, and then choose the proper settings for the default components, as well as having the opportunity to install additional services.
</P>
<p>You will next be prompted to decide whether this computer will be part of a domain or a workgroup environment. If you decide to add this computer to a domain, you will be prompted for an account and password for an account with the privileges to add computers to the domain.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Windows 2000 Setup will only install the first network adapter it finds. If your computer is multihomed (that is, it has more than one network adapter), you will need to install the other adapter after Setup has completed.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Final Phase</B></FONT></P>
<p>Next, Setup will begin copying the files necessary to install the selected components. Once the file copy is complete, Setup enters its final phase where it completes the following settings:
</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Install Start Menu Items</B>
<dd>Setup installs and configures the utilities on the Start Menu.
<dt><b>Register Components</B>
<dd>Builds the OLE Registration database information in the Registry for the standard components.
<dt><b>Save Settings</B>
<dd>This is where Setup builds the final copy of the Registry and initializes it.
<dt><b>Remove Temporary Files</B>
<dd>Setup will clean up after itself by deleting any temporary files used during the installation.
<dt><b>Reboot</B>
<dd>This is the final step in Setup. Once the computer is restarted, Windows 2000 Professional has been installed.
</DL>

<p><font size="+1"><b>Computer Name</B></FONT></P>
<p>All Windows 2000 computers need to have a name, even if they won&#146;t be on a network. You need to assign a unique name to your computer at this point in the setup. Choose a name that is meaningful to you, or one that fits the naming convention in use on your network.
</P>
<p>Remember that computer names can be up to 63 characters in length if you have TCP/IP installed, and up to 15 characters if it isn&#146;t installed. Valid names can contain the numbers 0-9, uppercase and lowercase letters, and hyphens in order to be backward compatible with other Microsoft network operating systems. You can use other characters as well, such as spaces, but if you do, your results with those older operating systems may be unpredictable.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading10"></A><font color="#000077">Installing to a Network</FONT></H3>
<p>Next you have to decide whether to install Windows 2000 as a stand-alone or networked machine. If you choose Do Not Connect This Computer to a Network at This Time, you can still add your computer to a domain anytime after the installation.
</P>
<p>To add your workstation to a domain or to change the domain for your workstation, you must do the following:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the System applet in the Control Panel.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Network Identification tab and then click Change. This will start the Network Identification Wizard as shown in Figure 20.2. Click Next.
<p><a name="Fig2"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch20/images/20-02.jpg',503,386)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch20/images/20-02t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch20/images/20-02.jpg',503,386)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 20.2</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Network Identification Wizard helps you to add your computer to a domain or workgroup.</P>
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You must select one of the options on the Connecting to the Network page of the wizard. The first option states that the Computer is Part of a Business Network, and will add your computer to a domain. The second option, This Computer is for Home Use, will help you to set up a workgroup for peer-to-peer networking. Click Next when you are ready to proceed. If you select the second option, you will be prompted for logon information and then to finish the settings. We will assume here that you are using the first option for a business network.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, you need to select whether the computer participates in a business network with a domain or without one. Click Next when you are ready. If you select Without a Domain, you will be prompted for the workgroup name.
<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Network Information page is designed to warn you that you will need to gather some information from your administrator before you can add your computer to the domain. The information you will need is listed on this page. Click Next after you gathered the information requested.
<dd><b>6.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you are asked to supply your user name, password, and the name of the domain you wish to join. Windows 2000 will attempt to contact a domain controller to verify your computer account. If it cannot find your computer account (as is the case when your administrator has not made the account yet), the wizard will prompt you to enter your computer name and domain name.
<dd><b>7.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You will very likely be prompted for a name and password for an account with the rights to make a new computer account. If you have that information, enter it in the dialog box and click Next. If not, this would be a great time to talk to your administrator.
<dd><b>8.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the wizard wants to help you add a user account to your local computer. This will grant the domain user account local access to your computer. It does not prevent you from using this computer with a domain user account, but it will make it easier for that domain account to access local resources on your computer. You can also choose not to add a new user at this time.
<dd><b>9.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Next to show the summary page for the wizard. This page will tell you that you need to click Finish to complete the process. When you click Finish, your computer will be restarted automatically. You can click Close to exit to Windows 2000 without rebooting the computer.
