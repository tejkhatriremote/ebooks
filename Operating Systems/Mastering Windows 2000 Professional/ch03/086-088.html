<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading29"></A><font color="#000077">The Windows 2000 Folder</FONT></H4>
<p>Your Windows 2000 folder (or <tt>Winnt</TT> folder, if you use the default name when installing it) contains several subfolders that perform specific functions for the operating system. By learning how these folders are structured, you&#146;ll not only understand how Windows 2000 works, but also how to make it work for you.</P>
<p>The Windows 2000 folder is divided into the following folders:</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Addins</B>
<dd>Contains configuration information for additional Windows 2000 components like the Fax service.
<dt><b>Cursors</B>
<dd>Stores Windows 2000&#146;s animated mouse cursors. This folder may be empty if you did not choose to install all the cursors during Windows 2000 Setup.
<dt><b>Debug</B>
<dd>Stores some information useful in recovering from a system failure. The files in this folder track the installation of the network during setup and back up the user&#146;s environment settings.
<dt><b>Downloaded Programs</B>
<dd>Contains the programs needed to display different types of active content on the Web. When you download a program that lets you view an animation on a Web page, the program is stored here.
<dt><b>Driver Cache</B>
<dd>This folder is new in Windows 2000. It contains a subfolder that holds all of the drivers that Windows 2000 might use at some point. This may save you from needing the CD-ROM when installing some new hardware.
<dt><b>Fonts</B>
<dd>Contains all your installed fonts. For more information on installing or removing fonts, please see Chapter 6, &#147;Printers and Printing.&#148;
<dt><b>Help</B>
<dd>Contains all Windows 2000&#146;s Help files. In addition to being called from individual applications or from Explorer, Help files can be launched by double-clicking them just like any other program. Help files for non-operating system programs&#151;Word, Excel, etc.&#151;are not stored here.
<dt><b>Inf</B>
<dd>This folder contains the information files (<tt>.inf</TT>) needed to install new hardware drivers.
<dt><b>Java</B>
<dd>Contains any Java applets and class libraries you may have downloaded when browsing the Internet or an intranet.
<dt><b>Media</B>
<dd>Stores system sound files. When you assign system sounds to different operating system events (for instance, Start Windows, New Mail, etc.), you call files from this folder. You can store any <tt>.wav</TT> file in this folder and make it available to Windows 2000. For more information on assigning system sounds, please see Chapter 5. For more information on <tt>.wav</TT> files, please see Chapter 7, &#147;Running Multimedia Applications.&#148;
<dt><b>MSAgent</B>
<dd>This folder is the home of the Microsoft Agent. The Agent is an animated character that can be scripted into a document or a Web page to provide interactive help for users.
<dt><b>Msapps</B>
<dd>Provides an install point for various Microsoft applications. By default it contains the MSInfo subfolder.
<dt><b>Offline Web Pages</B>
<dd>Holds any Web pages and their contents that you may have selected for offline caching.
<dt><b>Registration</B>
<dd>The Registration folder contains the encrypted product registration information for your installation of Windows 2000 Professional.
<dt><b>Repair</B>
<dd>Contains backup copies of some essential system files, so that you can restore them in the case of a system crash. The file called <tt>setup.log</TT> offers a map of where all of Windows 2000&#146;s essential system files were installed during installation. Use this file as a guide if you need to make Windows 2000 repairs.
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>In Windows 2000, the files in the Repair folder are no longer compressed as they were previously. If you ever need to access these files directly (other than during an emergency repair), you should be able to use them without having to uncompress them first.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<dt><b>Security</B>
<dd>This folder contains some of Windows 2000&#146;s security policy information. It would be wise to leave this information alone.
<dt><b>Speech</B>
<dd>These are the files needed to support the speech capabilities of Windows 2000. They are normally called upon when the Narrator from the Accessibility group is used to read selected text from the screen.
<dt><b>System</B>
<dd>Stores 16-bit system files that may be required to support Windows 3.1 applications. It also provides some backward compatibility for 16-bit Windows applications that really want to see a System folder.
<dt><b>System32</B>
<dd>Contains most of the files and program code that make Windows 2000 operate. This is the most important folder in Windows 2000. In addition to essential system files, System32 contains many of Windows 2000&#146;s applets and utilities.
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>As a rule, you should not manually move or change files in the System32 folder except as instructed by your Management Information Service (MIS) department or a technical support representative.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<dt><b>Tasks</B>
<dd>The Scheduled Tasks tool is new in Windows 2000. This tool provides easy scripting and a graphical interface for scheduling tasks on your system. Scripted tasks can be run by creating a batch file with the commands you want, and then scheduling the batch file to run using the Scheduled Tasks window in the System Tools group of the Start menu.
<dt><b>Temp</B>
<dd>This is the repository for any temporary files you may be creating through your interaction with different applications.
<dt><b>Twain32</B>
<dd>Contains files that support the use of the Twain32 for scanning images from a scanner. This folder is empty by default and will contain the necessary files when you install the drivers for a scanner.
<dt><b>Web</B>
<dd>This folder contains various Web documents that are used to provide the Tips shown at logon, templates for basic Web pages used in Windows 2000, and subfolders that contain the various wallpapers that can be displayed with the Active Desktop.
</DL>

<h3><a name="Heading30"></A><font color="#000077">Summary</FONT></H3>
<p>In Windows 2000, Explorer is everything. Windows Explorer is your doorway into the world of Windows 2000. Whether you are organizing your files, customizing your Desktop, or copying e-mail from your Outlook Express Inbox, Explorer is involved. By integrating Explorer so thoroughly into the Desktop, Windows 2000 avoids many of the pitfalls that users experienced under the File Manager/Program Manager duality of earlier versions of Windows.
</P>
<p>Explorer&#146;s greatest strength is its customizability. You can readily change views, manipulate folders, and customize right-click menus all with a few clicks of your mouse. Another virtue of Explorer is its integration with the rest of Windows 2000 and the Desktop. Complete drag-and-drop and OLE support affords you the freedom of being able to have your files where you need them, when you need them.</P>
<p>Moreover, Explorer&#146;s strengths extend to your network. All the activities and organizational tasks you routinely perform on your Desktop can also be accomplished on your local or remote network.</P><p><br></P>
