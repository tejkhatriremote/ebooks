<p><font size="+1"><b>The Advanced Tab</B></FONT></P>
<p>The second tab on the Taskbar and Start Menu Properties sheet, Advanced, affords more advanced options for configuring the Start menu. Although we wouldn&#146;t suggest using it to <i>add</I> programs to your Start menu (it is no match for the ease of the drag-and-drop approach outlined at the beginning of the chapter), the options offered by the Advanced tab are the fastest way to <i>remove</I> programs from the Start menu. Moreover, this tab offers more control over the appearance of the items listed on your Start menu, permitting changes to such properties as the following:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The icon that appears next to an item on the Start menu
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The order of the items on the Start menu
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of an item&#146;s window after it is opened
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Other options, depending on your system configuration

<tr><td><font size="+1"><b>Of Wizards and Mini-Explorers</B></FONT>
<p>The route you&#146;ll follow to change settings in Windows 2000 will often take you to one or more of the following types of assistant programs:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A wizard, which is a series of dialog boxes and folders programmed specifically to prompt you for additional information relating to the option you initially chose
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A mini-Explorer (or sometimes Explorer itself), which knows from the context of what you&#146;re doing to open folders and menus from which you can make appropriate selections
</DL>
<p>You&#146;ll see a couple of minor examples of these assistants in the following discussions. If you haven&#146;t yet mastered Explorer, don&#146;t worry; you&#146;ll just get a taste of what it can do in these next few paragraphs. The more extensive presentation of how you can make full use of Explorer takes up most of the remainder of the chapter.</TABLE>

<p><font size="+1"><b>Removing Programs from the Start Menu</B></FONT></P>
<p>Follow the directions below to remove programs from the Start menu.
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-click the Taskbar and choose Properties.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Advanced tab.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Remove button. A mini-Explorer opens, showing the items on the Start menu arranged hierarchically like files in a folder, which is essentially what they are.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;From the mini-Explorer window, click the item you want to remove. If you had to go to a fly-out menu (such as Programs) when you used the Start menu to access the item, the item will be in a subfolder in the mini-Explorer window now.
<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Remove button.
<dd><b>6.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A dialog box asks if you are sure you want to delete the program. (Are you? Click OK if you are sure.)
<dd><b>7.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Close button to finish the process.
</DL>
<p><font size="+1"><b>The Advanced Button and Explorer</B></FONT></P>
<p>You might recall that in previous versions of Windows the File Manager offered a View menu that, among other things, let you rearrange the order of the files it was listing for you. The approach to rearranging the items on the Start menu is similar in Windows 2000: If you go to Explorer, you can use <i>its</I> View menu to rearrange the items in the Start menu folder (or any of its subfolders).</P>
<p>You can go to Explorer any way you like, but if you don&#146;t remember where your Start Menu folder lies in the hierarchy of your hard drive, you may need to hunt for it. (In fact, your computer may have a confusing multitude of Start Menu folders. Remember that because Windows 2000 is a multiuser environment, you may elect to have different Start menus for the different types of work you do. Also, all other users who log on to your system have their own profile, and that profile includes their individual folder of Start menu items.) Windows 2000 can help you make short work of this confusion by taking you directly to your own current Start Menu folder. When you click the Advanced button on the Advanced tab, you are led to an Explorer window that automatically opens with your Start Menu folder open, the Start menu&#146;s items listed, and the commands and buttons for rearranging, renaming, and copying those items right at hand. While you&#146;re there, you can continue to use Explorer to do just about anything else you might normally want to do with Explorer, just as you would if you had run Explorer by itself. Unlike the mini-Explorer, which usually displays an incomplete set of Explorer features, you don&#146;t need to go straight back to the tab that gave rise to it.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>When you right-click the Start button and choose Explorer in Windows 2000, the default view is your own Programs group. To access the common groups of the Start menu, use Windows Explorer to browse to the All Users profile and edit the Start menu there. This enables you to modify the Start menu programs that everyone using the computer will see.<hr></FONT>
