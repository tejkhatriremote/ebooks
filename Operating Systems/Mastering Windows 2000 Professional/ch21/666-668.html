<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading8"></A><font color="#000077">Finding Registry Keys</FONT></H4>
<p>How did we know that we had to go to <tt>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion</TT> in order to change the organization name? We found it by poking around the Registry.</P>
<p>If you have the Windows 2000 Resource Kit from Microsoft&#151;and if you don&#146;t, then get it!&#151;you&#146;ll find 150 pages detailing each and every key. (That, by the way, is why this book doesn&#146;t contain a complete key guide; first, there wasn&#146;t anything that we could add to the contents of the Resource Kit; second, Microsoft&#146;s already published the kit; and third, 150 pages directly lifted from someone else&#146;s publication is a pretty serious copyright violation, and it&#146;s not really possible to &#147;paraphrase&#148; 150 pages of reference material.) Additionally, the Registry keys are documented in an Online Help file. Unfortunately, the documentation for some keys is hidden away in bits and pieces on Microsoft TechNet or the like, and so we do mention <i>those</I> in this book.</P>
<p>If you do <i>not</I> have the Resource Kit, then you can download the Registry key Help file from the WINNT forum on CompuServe. A few other tools facilitate searching for things in the Registry. One real weakness (in our opinion) in the Registry Editor is the absence of an effective search routine. Suppose you knew that there was something called RegisteredOrganization but you had no idea where it lived in the Registry? You&#146;d be out of luck. The program <tt>regedt32.exe</TT> includes a View/Find Key, but it searches only the names of <i>keys</I>, not value entries. As RegisteredOrganization is a value name within the key CurrentVersion, you would be able to search for it only if you knew that the key&#146;s name was CurrentVersion&#151;not a likely prospect. You can find shareware or freeware Registry search programs on the Internet; look in any Web search engine to find one.</P>
<p>Actually, Microsoft <i>did</I> provide one tool to use when searching the Registry. They included <tt>regedit.exe</TT> from Windows 95, which has the built-in capability to search for key names, subkeys, values and data. You can access this tool by typing <b>regedit.exe</B> at either the command prompt or at the Run command on the Start menu. One word of caution, though. There have been cases where using <tt>regedit.exe</TT> to modify the Registry caused corruption in the Registry files. So the general rule is this: Search with <tt>regedit.exe;</TT> modify with <tt>regedt32.exe</TT>.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading9"></A><font color="#000077">Heeding Even More Cautions about Editing the Registry</FONT></H4>
<p>If you&#146;re just learning about the Registry, then you&#146;re probably eager to wade right in and modify a value entry. Before you do, however, let&#146;s talk just a bit about using caution in manipulating the Registry. (We know we&#146;ve mentioned this subject before, but it&#146;s important, so we&#146;re mentioning it again.)
</P>
<p>The vast majority of Registry items correspond to some setting in the Control Panel or to some other program. For example, you can change screen colors or File Manager confirmation options directly via the Registry Editor.</P>
<p>We only picked those examples, however, because they were fairly illustrative and simple to understand. In general, <i>don&#146;t use the Registry to modify a value that can be modified otherwise</I>.</P>
<p>For example, suppose you want to set a background color on your screen to medium gray. That color is represented as the following triplet of numbers: 128 128 128. (These color values are the same as Windows 3.<i>x</I> color values. Color values in Windows are expressed as number triplets and each number is an integer from 0 to 255.) If you input a value greater than 255, then the Registry Editor would neither know nor care that you were punching in an illegal color value. Now, in the case of colors, entering illegal values probably wouldn&#146;t crash the system. In the case of <i>other</I> items, however, you could easily render your system unusable. For example, if you&#146;re running Windows 2000 Professional on a system with just a single Pentium II processor, the Registry reflects that, noting in one of the Hardware keys that Windows 2000 is running in uniprocessor mode. Changing that setting to multiprocessor mode wouldn&#146;t be a very good idea.</P>
<p>Why, then, are we bothering telling you about the Registry Editor? Three reasons:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You <i>must</I> use the Registry Editor to alter some important settings. Consequently, a Windows 2000 expert has to have some proficiency in the Editor.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use the Registry Editor to change value entries on <i>remote</I> computers.
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you&#146;re at location A and you want to change the background color on the server at location B, then you have to physically travel to location B in order to run the Control Panel on the Windows 2000 machine at that location. Or, you can start up the Registry Editor, choose Registry/Select Computer, and edit the Registry of the remote computer. (This procedure assumes that you are running Windows 2000 Professional and that you have the security access to change the Registry of the remote computer&#151;that is, you&#146;re a member of the Administrators group on that computer.)<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can write scripts to modify Registries by using the <tt>regini.exe</TT> program that comes with the Resource Kit. Such a tool is quite powerful; in theory, you could write a <tt>regini</TT> script to completely reconfigure a Windows 2000 setup.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B><i>Please</I> be sure that you have developed some proficiency with the Registry before you attempt to use <tt>regini.exe</TT>. We&#146;ve explained some of the kinds of mischief that you can cause working by hand with the Registry Editor; imagine what kinds of <i>automated</I> disasters you could start at 366MHz with a bad <tt>regini</TT> script!<hr></FONT>
