<h3><a name="Heading5"></A><font color="#000077">Entering Text</FONT></H3>
<p>Notice the main document area of the WordPad window. Because you haven&#146;t typed anything yet, the only item to look at is the blinking cursor in the upper-left corner. This <i>insertion point</I> indicates the place where new text appears when you type.</P>
<p>Now, begin creating a document. Of course, you&#146;re free to type anything you want. However, to establish a consistent text to refer to later in this chapter, try entering the following hypothetical news story. (For later steps in the tutorial, keep the two misspelled words, <i>Pizza</I> and <i>sight</I>, as they are.) If you are at all unfamiliar with word processors, first read the steps that follow this text:</P>
<dl>
<dd>NEWS FLASH
<dd>Society for Anachronistic Sciences
<dd>1000 Edsel Lane
<dd>Piltdown, PA 19042
<dd>The Society for Anachronistic Sciences announced its controversial findings today at a press conference held in the city of Pisa, Italy. Pizza was not chosen as the sight for the conference because of its celebrated position in the annals of Western scientific history. The Society has made public its annual press conferences for well over 300 years and, as usual, nothing new was revealed. According to its members, this is a comforting fact and a social service in an age when everything else seems to change.
</DL>
<p>Begin entering the text into your new file, following the steps outlined below. If you make mistakes while you are typing, use the Backspace key to back up and fix them. If you don&#146;t see an error until you have typed past it, leave it for now. You&#146;ll learn how to fix mistakes later.
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Type <b>NEWS FLASH</B> on the first line.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, press Enter twice to move down a couple of lines to prepare for typing the address. Notice that pressing Enter is necessary to add new blank lines in a word processing document. Pressing the down arrow key will not move the cursor down a line at this point or create new lines; you will only hear an error beep from your computer if you try this.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Type the first line of the address, then press Enter to move down to the next line. Repeat this process for the last two lines of the address.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Press Enter twice to put in another blank line.
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Don&#146;t insert two spaces (that is, don&#146;t press the spacebar twice) between sentences as you would with a typewriter. WordPad automatically adds enough space to clearly separate each sentence. If you add two spaces, your text will print with unsightly gaps between sentences.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Begin entering the body of the story. Don&#146;t forget to leave in the spelling mistakes so you can fix them later. When you get to the end of a line, keep typing. You shouldn&#146;t press Enter, because WordPad automatically moves text that overflows to the next line for you. This is called <i>word wrapping</I>. All you need to do is keep typing&#151;and leave only one space between sentences, not two.
</DL>
<p>When you&#146;ve finished entering the sample text, the WordPad window should look something like Figure 9.3.
</P>

<h3><a name="Heading6"></A><font color="#000077">Inserting the Date or Time in a Document</FONT></H3>
<p>One of WordPad&#146;s few frills is a special command that automatically inserts today&#146;s date or the current time into your document. For dates, you have many style choices. Depending on the document&#146;s intended audience, you can pick an abbreviated format, such as 12/12/99, or let WordPad write out the full date, as in December 12, 1999. For the time, you can choose among two versions of the 12-hour <small>AM/PM</SMALL> format that most people use and the 24-hour military format.</P>
<p><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch09/images/09-05i.jpg"> To insert the date or time, follow these steps:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose Insert <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch09/images/09-06i.jpg"> Date and Time, or if the toolbar is visible, click the Date and Time button (shown here). The Insert Date and Time dialog box appears.<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dialog box, choose your preferred style for the date or time from the list. The list offers more choices than will fit in the box, so scroll through it if you don&#146;t see the style you want.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the OK button to insert the chosen information in your document.
</DL>
<h3><a name="Heading7"></A><font color="#000077">Formatting Paragraphs</FONT></H3>
<p>Paragraphs are the most essential division of your text when it comes to <i>formatting</I>, which simply means controlling the appearance of your document. As defined by WordPad, a paragraph is any text terminated by pressing the Enter key. So even single letters, lines, or words are treated as paragraphs if you press Enter after typing them. For that matter, pressing Enter on a completely blank line creates a paragraph, albeit an empty one.</P>
<p>WordPad handles each paragraph as a separate entity, with its own formatting information. The press release you created earlier in the chapter uses a standard block-paragraph format typical of many business letters. In that format, a paragraph&#146;s first line is not indented, so you separate paragraphs with an empty paragraph. Also notice that the right margin is <i>ragged</I>, rather than aligned evenly&#151;or <i>justified</I>&#151;as it is on the left margin.</P>
<p>These and other qualities affecting the appearance of your paragraphs can be altered while you are entering text or at any time thereafter. As you change the format settings, you immediately see the effects. Bold letters look bold, centered lines look centered, italic letters look slanted, and so forth.</P>
<p>For most documents, you may find that you are satisfied with WordPad&#146;s default format. WordPad applies the standard default format for you, carrying it from one paragraph to the next as you type. If you decide you would rather use a different format for a new document, alter some settings before typing. Then everything you type into the new document will be formatted accordingly until you change the settings again.</P><p><br></P>
