<p><big><big>P</BIG></BIG>aint is a program for the artist in you. It&#146;s a simple but capable program for painting and drawing images on your computer screen. You can brush on colors free-form, draw lines and geometric shapes, and even add text to your pictures. A variety of nifty special effects are at your command, too.</P>
<p>Here are some ideas for things you can do with Paint:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Create printed signs
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Create illustrations for printed matter
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Create images for use in other Windows programs
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Design invitations
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Enhance digitized images or photographs
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Draw maps
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Make wallpaper images for your Windows 2000 Desktop
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Edit clip art (pre-drawn images you can buy in collections)
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean up &#147;digital dust&#148; from scanned images
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Edit graphics embedded or linked into documents created by other programs

<p>To bring up Paint, follow these steps:

</DL>
<p>The <i>work area</I> is the main part of the window where you do your painting. Along the left side, the <i>toolbox</I> provides a set of buttons for activating the tools you use to paint. You choose colors from the <i>color box</I> at the bottom of the window. Along the bottom of the window, the status bar offers Help messages on menu choices and displays the coordinates of the mouse pointer.</P>

<p>Before going any further, let&#146;s pause for a little background on how Paint works. This information will help you get the results you want from your artistic creations.
</P>
<p>In the personal computer world, there are two basic classes of pictures, or <i>graphics</I>: bitmapped and object-oriented. Paint can create and edit only bitmapped graphics.</P>

<table border="2" bordercolor="#0000" align="CENTER">
<tr><td><font size="+1"><b>Tips for Windows 3.x and NT 3.x Users</B></FONT>
<p>Compared to its Windows 3.<i>x</I> (and NT 3.<i>x</I>) predecessor, Paintbrush, MS Paint has more features, looks a little snazzier, and has changed some of its commands and buttons. Still, Paint will seem very familiar if you&#146;ve worked with Paintbrush. The one big difference that you might not notice is this: You can paint with the <i>right</I> mouse button, not just the left (using the right button paints with the background color). Aside from that, most of the tools work about the same as they did in Paintbrush.</P>
<p>Although they aren&#146;t earthshaking, new features are plentiful in Paint. You get two new tools: the Eyedropper and the Pencil. Manipulating selections is much easier now that they have resize handles, and you can rotate them or even use them as a brush shape. Print Preview lets you check your work before you print, saving paper and time. It&#146;s easier to work with text by virtue of the Text toolbar (for setting font, size, and style). And you can Undo three previous commands, not just one.</P>
<p>You give up some features, too. The Color Eraser tool is gone. You can&#146;t use shadow or outline styles with text. Paintbrush let you print headers and footers; Paint does not. But if you are enamored of any of these features, you don&#146;t need to give them up. Because both programs can open the same files, you can keep Paintbrush on your hard disk and use it when the need arises.</P>
<p>Here&#146;s a list of some of the tools and menu commands that have changed:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paint Roller tool in Paintbrush is the Paint Can tool in Paint.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shrink and Grow command in Paintbrush is Stretch in Paint.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tilt command in Paintbrush is Skew in Paint.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inverse command in Paintbrush is Invert Colors in Paint.
</DL>
</TABLE>

<p>In programs such as Paint, you create a picture on the computer screen as if you were painting on a canvas with paint. Imagine yourself painting the Mona Lisa. With each stroke of the brush, the paint you apply to the canvas sticks irreversibly, covering up whatever was there before.
</P>
<p>In Paint, you use colored dots on the screen as your paint, but the process is otherwise quite similar. After you&#146;ve placed anything on the screen (and unless you use Undo immediately), it becomes an integral part of the image. It remains there until you cover it up with something else.</P>
<p>Here&#146;s why Paint works this way. Your computer&#146;s screen is divided into very small dots (<i>pixels</I> or <i>pels</I>) that are controlled by the smallest division of computer information&#151;<i>bits</I>. A <i>bitmap</I> is a collection of bits of information that creates an image when assigned (<i>mapped</I>) to dots on the screen. This is similar to a sports scoreboard that can display the score, a message, or even a picture by turning on and off specific light bulbs in a grid.</P>
<p>The point is that the only thing Paint knows about the image on your screen is which dot should be displayed in which color. When you change the picture, Paint doesn&#146;t keep track of whether you paint a line, draw a circle, or type some text. Instead, it simply changes its map of colored dots; the new dots blend into all the other ones.</P><p><br></P>
