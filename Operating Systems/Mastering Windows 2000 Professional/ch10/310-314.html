<p>This means that bitmapped graphics can be incredibly detailed because you can control the color of each and every dot in your picture if you want to (with the Zoom command). That&#146;s why bitmapped graphics are used to create artwork with the rich detail of a real painting and to store photographic images that have been recorded by a scanner.
</P>
<p>On the other hand, you should keep some limitations in mind. After you paint a shape, you can&#146;t move it independently. True, you can use the computer to remove an area of the painting and place it somewhere else, as if you were cutting out a piece of the canvas and pasting it elsewhere. But <i>all</I> the dots in the area get moved, not just the ones in the shape you&#146;re interested in. Also, because a bitmapped graphic has a fixed number of dots, its resolution is fixed. You can&#146;t make it look sharper by printing it on a higher-resolution printer, for example.</P>
<p>In contrast, in object-oriented graphics, the computer stores each shape as a separate entity (something like those felt boards you used in grade school). Each line, circle, and text character retains its identity as a separate object. These objects can later be moved, sized, cut, copied, and otherwise altered without affecting anything else in the picture. In addition, object-oriented graphics always display and print at the maximum possible resolution of the device you&#146;re using.</P>
<p>With object-oriented graphics, it&#146;s more difficult to do detailed work, especially involving random shapes and color blends, than with bitmapped graphics. On the other hand, this type of computer art is great for line drawings, logos, and poster-like illustrations.</P>
<p>Windows 2000 Professional doesn&#146;t come with an object-oriented graphics program. Popular programs of this type include Corel Draw, Adobe Illustrator, and Micrografx Designer. Also, simple object-oriented graphics modules are included in many word processors and spreadsheets.</P>
<p>Now that you know what kind of graphics you&#146;re working with in Paint, let&#146;s get to work.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading4"></A><font color="#000077">Opening an Existing Picture</FONT></H3>
<p>Paint can open only the picture files stored in its own format (also known as the <tt>.bmp</TT> format). If you want to open pictures stored in other formats, such as <tt>.pcx</TT> or <tt>.tif</TT>, you&#146;ll need to translate them to the <tt>.bmp</TT> format with conversion software first.</P>
<p>To open, or <i>load</I>, an existing picture, do the following:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose File <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-04i.jpg"> Open.<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the picture by name in the Open dialog box. Windows 2000 comes with many Paint-style pictures in the main Windows directory. Figure 10.2 shows a picture of weightless chess pieces open in Paint.
<p><a name="Fig2"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-02.jpg',600,450)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-02t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-02.jpg',600,450)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 10.2</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture file opened and displayed in the work area</P>
</DL>
<p>Now you can edit the picture and save it again or copy any part of it to the Clipboard for use with other programs.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Paint remembers the last four pictures you&#146;ve opened or saved, listing them by name at the bottom of the File menu. To open one of these pictures without slowing down for the Open dialog box, just choose the picture from the File menu.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h3><a name="Heading5"></A><font color="#000077">Seeing More of the Picture</FONT></H3>
<p>If the picture is too big to fit in the work area, you can, of course, scroll to see any part of the image. But scrolling is a nuisance. You can also take steps to see more of the picture all at once, as explained in the following sections.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading6"></A><font color="#000077">Removing and Tearing Off the Tool and Color Boxes</FONT></H4>
<p>The simplest method you can use to increase your viewing area is to remove the tools along the left side and bottom of the Paint window. You don&#146;t need to give them up entirely. Instead, you can &#147;tear them off&#148; so they become floating windows that are easy to reposition on the screen.
</P>
<p>To tear off the tool or color box, click any part of the box&#146;s background. Hold down the mouse button and drag the window outline that appears in the work area. As shown in Figure 10.3, the box becomes a separate &#147;floating&#148; window that you can move as needed to work with your picture.</P>
<p><a name="Fig3"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-03.jpg',600,449)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-03t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-03.jpg',600,449)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 10.3</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Here&#146;s how the tool and color boxes look when you &#147;tear&#148; them from their standard locations, thereby turning them into separate, movable windows.</P>
<p>If you don&#146;t need the tool or color box (not very likely, but once in a while this may be the case), you can turn them off altogether. Open the View menu and choose the corresponding menu command. You can also remove the status bar at the bottom of the screen this way. To turn an item back on, choose its command again from the View menu.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>When a screen item (toolbox, color box, or status bar) is visible, the View menu displays a check mark beside the item&#146;s command; there&#146;s no check mark displayed if the item has been turned off.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Alternatively, if you&#146;ve torn off a box making it a separate window, you can remove the box from the screen by clicking its Close box (the &#147;X&#148; in the upper-right corner). To turn it on again, choose the corresponding item on the View menu. It will appear on the screen in its previous location.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading7"></A><font color="#000077">Displaying Only the Picture</FONT></H4>
<p>If you want to look at as much of your picture as possible, choose View <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-05i.jpg"> View Bitmap. The picture fills the entire Paint window; all the other screen elements, including the title bar, menu bar, and scroll bars disappear. You still may not be able to see the whole picture, of course, but this is as good as it gets. And all you can do is look at the picture&#151;you can&#146;t make any changes. Clicking anywhere on the screen or pressing any key returns you to the working screen.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>You can also get a full screen view of your bitmap by pressing Ctrl&#43;F, which is the keyboard shortcut for View Bitmap.<hr></FONT>
