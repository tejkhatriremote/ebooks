<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading20"></A><font color="#000077">Connecting to a Shared ClipBook Page</FONT></H4>
<p>So much for creating your own ClipBook pages, using them locally (that means on your computer), and sharing them with other network users. What about connecting to another network station&#146;s ClipBook to use those pages? And, by the same token, how do other users connect to your ClipBook pages after you&#146;ve shared them?
</P>
<p>It&#146;s a relatively straightforward process. You simply use the File <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-16i.jpg"> Connect command in the ClipBook Viewer to browse the network and connect to the desired station and page. Then you use the pages as if they were your own. Here are the steps:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Run ClipBook Viewer and open the local ClipBook window.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the File menu and click Connect.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Browse to select the computer whose ClipBook has the information you want, or type in its name.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the OK button. If a password is required for the remote ClipBook, you are prompted to enter it. The newly available page(s) now appear in a new window within your ClipBook Viewer. When you attempt to access one of its pages, you may be prompted for a password.
<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you&#146;re finished using another person&#146;s ClipBook, you may want to disconnect from it. Simply activate the particular remote ClipBook&#146;s icon or window within your ClipBook Viewer and choose File <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-17i.jpg"> Disconnect.</DL>
<h3><a name="Heading21"></A><font color="#000077">Using OLE</FONT></H3>
<p>The ability to run numerous programs, simultaneously switching between them at will and copying data between documents, marked a major advance in desktop computing, especially on the PC. Merely for its task-switching capabilities, Windows has been embraced by thousands of DOS diehards who don&#146;t even like Windows. They use Windows just to switch between multiple DOS programs!
</P>
<p>However, the Clipboard and ClipBook impose severe limitations to the idea of truly &#147;transparent&#148; data sharing between applications. If you&#146;ve been following Windows developments over the past several years, you&#146;ll know that post&#150;Windows 3 products (3.1, Windows for Workgroups, Windows 9<i>x</I>, Windows NT 3.<i>x</I> and 4, and now Windows 2000) have taken data sharing several steps further with schemes called Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), Network DDE, and Object Linking and Embedding (OLE).</P>
<p>If you read computer magazines at all, you&#146;ve likely been as inundated as we have on the topic of OLE 2, the latest and greatest of data-sharing schemes, which was incorporated into NT. In fact, you may already be familiar with its predecessor, OLE 1, and know that you can use it to create fancy documents combining bits and pieces of data from a variety of programs scattered on your hard disk or across your company&#146;s network.</P>
<p>On the other hand, many veteran Windows users have only the barest awareness of OLE and consider it some kind of black art (along with, unfortunately, such simple tasks as using a modem or getting their printer to work). So why should they care about OLE? The vast majority of folks don&#146;t understand OLE or DDE&#146;s nuances and stick instead with the tried and true Clipboard when it comes to passing data between applications. (Want a chart in that report? Paste it in!)</P>
<p>And for good reason. <i>Live</I> data sharing such as that offered by Windows OLE and DDE are the stuff computer-science conventions are made of. There are some highly technical distinctions between DDE and OLE that are a bit difficult to grasp, not to mention that not all Windows applications are OLE aware or implement OLE in the same way when they are. Add to this some confusion concerning OLE&#146;s use over a PC network, and you&#146;ve got a topic in need of clarification!</P>
<p>In hopes of dispelling some of the confusion, we offer in this section a brief OLE and DDE primer. This section fills you in on why you won&#146;t be using DDE, why you&#146;d want to use OLE, and how easy OLE 2 makes creating flashy documents that take advantage of all that power your computer has under its hood.</P><p><br></P>
