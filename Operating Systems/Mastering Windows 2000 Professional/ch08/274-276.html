<p><font size="+1"><b>Object Packages</B></FONT></P>
<p>In addition to the two basic OLE options of linking and embedding, there is a third variation of OLE called <i>packaging</I>. Packaging is a technique you can use to wrap an object into a cute little bundle represented by an icon. Then you drop the icon into the destination document. For example, you might want to drop a sound clip or video clip into a document in this way. When the reader of the container document comes across the icon, he or she just double-clicks it and it unwraps, so to speak. The video clip runs in a window, a sound clip plays, and so forth. Of course, this is useful only if the document is being viewed on a computer, because nothing happens when you double-click a piece of paper! It&#146;s particularly useful when sending e-mail messages because it keeps the messages smaller. Figure 8.14 shows an example of a WordPad document with a sound-file package embedded in it.</P>

<p>You can add a package to a document using Explorer, the File Manager, or the Object Packager program.

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading24"></A><font color="#000077">OLE 2 vs. OLE 1</FONT></H4>
<p>OLE 1 represented a great stride forward in application integration when it was introduced with Windows 3.1. However, it still left much to be desired. For starters, creating and moving objects between applications was awkward, requiring use of the Clipboard. With OLE 2, you can use the ubiquitous drag-and-drop approach. By Ctrl-dragging, you can copy the object.
</P>
<p>Editing embedded objects is also much easier. In OLE 1, editing embedded objects confused users because double-clicking an object brought up its source application in another window on the screen with the object loaded into that window. You would use the other application&#146;s window to change the data, and then exit that application. This returned you to the original application with the data updated. This process was not particularly intuitive, because you felt as though you had left the report you were working on.</P>
<p>In contrast, with OLE 2 another window does <i>not</I> appear. You are still in the window you began in. The two participating applications negotiate an arrangement whereby the menus, toolbars, menu commands, and palettes on the menus within the primary document&#146;s application window change. An example of this was shown in Figure 8.12 earlier in the chapter.</P>
<p>This convenient arrangement has been dubbed <i>visual editing</I>, and it is much more intuitively obvious for users. Note however, that it applies to editing only embedded objects, not linked ones, and works only if both applications are OLE 2-enabled. Linked objects are edited in separate windows, just as with OLE 1.</P>
<p>The other primary problem with OLE 1 was that moving any of the linked object files would break the link, resulting in an error message when the compound document was opened. OLE 2 solves this problem by enabling you to move files to other drives or directories at will. As long as all the linked files are present in the directory, the compound document will still be intact. As another way around having to deal with multiple files in compound documents composed of many objects, OLE 2 enables you to easily convert all the links in a compound document to embedded objects. This, in essence, takes all the relevant data that was previously stored in separate files and squishes it into a single (albeit a larger) one. With OLE 1, breaking the link meant losing the object altogether and needing to reestablish it.</P>
<p>Another interesting feature of OLE 2 is that it conforms to a <i>transaction-based</I> I/O model. Thus, an OLE 2-enabled application can undo changes that were made to a compound document. For example, if you cut an embedded object, the application can undo the cut, reestablishing the presence of the object in the file.</P>
<p>Next, OLE 2 specifies a new type of file format called the Compound File Format. This new format helps the operating system more efficiently store and edit complex documents that contain numerous objects. One advantage to this is that you can now edit a compound document object on an <i>incremental</I> basis rather than editing the entire object. For example, say you double-click a series of spreadsheet cells embedded in your text-based report and start editing the cells. Only the cells you alter will be updated, rather than the whole series of cells. This makes for faster updating and faster overall performance.</P>
<p>Finally, the expanded OLE 2 specification not only enables document objects such as charts, pictures, video, and sound to communicate, but it also works with program modules. As you may know, many applications are composed of separate modules (each one usually stored in separate <tt>.dll</TT> files). A <tt>.dll</TT> file typically performs a specific function, such as spell checking, within a word processing program. OLE 2 supplies a standard by which program modules can communicate with one another. As applications are written to comply with this standard, you&#146;ll have the option of mixing and matching your favorite program modules to create the &#147;perfect&#148; application. For example, you could buy a replacement spell checker for your favorite word processor, a favorite macro organizer for your spreadsheet, or some flashy graphics-manipulation tools for your favorite image-processing program.</P><p><br></P>
