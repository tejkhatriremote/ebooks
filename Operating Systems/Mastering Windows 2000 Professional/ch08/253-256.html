<p><font size="+1"><b>Pasting into a DOS Box</B></FONT></P>
<p>As weird as this seems, you can also paste into DOS applications&#151;weird because most DOS applications were invented way before the Windows Clipboard was even a twinkle in Bill Gates&#146;s eye. There are certain limitations to this technique, such as pasting only text (no graphics). This is for obvious reasons&#151;pasting graphics into a DOS application would be a nightmare. It simply wouldn&#146;t work because there is no standard agreement among DOS applications as to the treatment of on-screen graphics. Even with text, the results of pasting may be less than expected, because all DOS applications don&#146;t accept data the same way.
</P>
<p>You should be aware that all text formatting will be lost when you paste text into a DOS document. This is because formatting (bold, italics, fonts, bullets, and so forth) is application-specific information (specially coded for each program), and most applications just don&#146;t speak the same language at this point.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Although you can&#146;t paste graphics directly into DOS applications, here&#146;s a way to work around that: Simply paste the graphic into a Windows-based graphics program such as Paint or Corel Draw. Then save the graphic in a file that&#146;s readable by the DOS graphics program. Most DOS programs can read <tt>.bmp</TT> or <tt>.pcx</TT> files, and most Windows graphics programs can save files in these formats.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>When it comes time to do the pasting into a DOS application, here are the steps:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Put the desired text on the Clipboard by cutting or copying it from somewhere.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Toggle the destination DOS application so it&#146;s a window (it won&#146;t work if the DOS box is full-screen size).
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Position the DOS application&#146;s cursor at the location where you want to insert the Clipboard&#146;s material. This <i>must</I> be the location where you would next type text into the DOS document.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the DOS box&#146;s System menu (press Alt&#43;spacebar), and select Edit <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-06i.jpg"> Paste.</DL>
<p>Figure 8.3 shows an example in which we&#146;re about to insert Clipboard text into a DOS text-based program (our apologies to H.W. Longfellow).

<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-04.jpg',947,481)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 8.3</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;To paste text into a DOS application running in a window, select Edit, then Paste from the DOS box&#146;s System menu.</P>
<p>The process of pasting into a DOS box is interesting. The text on the Clipboard is sent to the portion of the operating system that&#146;s responsible for buffering keyboard data entry. When you paste, the application thinks you have typed in the new text from the keyboard. For the procedure to work correctly, however, the recipient program must be written in such a way that it doesn&#146;t balk at receiving information at the speed a supernormal typist could enter it.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you use the DOS box (command prompt) often, consider using the Edit <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-07i.jpg"> Copy command to copy long and unwieldy path names from the DOS prompt to the Clipboard. You can then paste these into a File Save, Start Run, or a Create Shortcut dialog box and spare yourself some typing.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading9"></A><font color="#000077">Using Right-Click Shortcuts for Cut, Copy, and Paste</FONT></H4>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the cut, copy, and paste scheme is implemented throughout Windows 2000, even on the Desktop, in Explorer, in folder windows, and so forth. This is done using right-mouse-button shortcuts. Some applications are also starting to offer this feature.
</P>
<p>For example, right-clicking a file in a folder window and choosing Copy puts a pointer to the file on the Clipboard. Right-clicking another location, such as the Desktop, and choosing Paste drops the file there (on the Desktop). This shortcut is being pushed by Microsoft and is included in some of its applications such as Word and Excel. Expect to see it included in applications from other makers, particularly 32-bit NT or Windows 2000 applications. Try clicking&#151;with the secondary (usually the right) mouse button&#151;icons or selected text or graphics in applications to see if there is a shortcut menu. Figure 8.4 shows an example of copying some text from a Word for Windows document using this shortcut.</P>

Windows applications are beginning to implement this feature, too, as you see here in Word for Windows.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading10"></A><font color="#000077">Working with the ClipBook Viewer</FONT></H3>
<p>In NT 4, there were two programs to handle viewing objects that had been placed on the Clipboard. One was Clipboard Viewer, the other was ClipBook Viewer. In Windows 2000, these two programs have been combined into one program called ClipBook Viewer (<tt>clipbrd.exe</TT>). This program lets you do some useful Clipboard-related tasks, such as</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;View the Clipboard&#146;s contents.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Save and retrieve the Clipboard&#146;s contents to or from a file.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear the Clipboard&#146;s contents.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set up pages of the Clipboard, with each page storing information you plan to use later or want to make available to networked colleagues.
</DL>
<p>Let&#146;s look at each of these simple tasks in order.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading11"></A><font color="#000077">Viewing the Clipboard&#146;s Contents</FONT></H4>
<p>You may simply forget what information is on the Clipboard; you don&#146;t remember what you cut or copied last. Before you paste it into an application (especially if that application doesn&#146;t have an Undo command) you might want to check out what will be inserted. Viewing the Clipboard&#146;s contents is also useful when you&#146;ve tried to get a particular item into the Clipboard and don&#146;t know how successful you&#146;ve been. Bringing up the Viewer and positioning it off in the corner of the screen can give you instant feedback as you cut and copy.
</P>
<p>Here&#146;s how to view the Clipboard&#146;s contents:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Start button and choose Run. Type in <tt>clipbrd.exe</TT> and press the Enter key to open the ClipBook Viewer window.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Double-click the Clipboard icon in the bottom left corner of the window or open the Window menu and choose Clipboard. The ClipBook icon turns into a window, displaying the Clipboard&#146;s current contents. Figure 8.5 shows typical Clipboard contents, in this case, a portion of an image just copied from the Paint program.
</DL>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you use the ClipBook Viewer frequently, you&#146;ll find it helpful to create a shortcut on your Desktop, or even add a shortcut to your Start menu.<hr></FONT>
