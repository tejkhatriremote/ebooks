<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading23"></A><font color="#000077">Basic OLE Concepts</FONT></H4>
<p>It&#146;s important that you have a working understanding of OLE terms and concepts before you try creating documents with OLE. Also, it&#146;s important that you understand that differences exist between OLE 1 and OLE 2. As of this writing, only a handful of applications are 2-enabled. Although OLE 2 is backward-compatible with 1, meaning you can mix and match the two, the techniques you&#146;ll use to create compound documents differ somewhat. In this section, we explain all you need to know to use OLE 1 or 2 to put together some fancy compound documents. We also explain what&#146;s so great about OLE 2.
</P>
<p>So let&#146;s start with objects. What is an object, really? An <i>object</I> is any single block of information stored as a separate bundle but incorporated into a document. An object can consist of as little as a single spreadsheet cell, database field, or graphic element; or as much as an entire spreadsheet, database, or a complete picture or video clip.</P>
<p>Next, there&#146;s the issue of the differences between <i>linking</I> and <i>embedding</I>. With OLE, you have the option of using either one. You either link <i>or</I> embed an object&#151;not both. Linking and embedding are different in functionality. Also you work with linked objects differently than you do with embedded ones. Study the images in Figure 8.13 for a moment.</P>

<tr><td><font size="+1"><b>What Is DDE?</B></FONT>
<p>OLE is getting all the attention these days, but you might run into another term while reading about data-sharing methods in Windows. An older and less ambitious means for intercommunication between applications is called Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), and it is also included in Windows 2000. Some older applications used DDE to achieve some of the same results you get nowadays with OLE. Windows NT Workstation 4, Windows for Workgroups, and Windows 9<i>x</I> have included an updated network version of DDE called NetDDE that enables applications to talk to one another over the network as well as on the same machine. And actually, OLE uses DDE as its communications link between programs.</P>
<p>The downside of DDE is that although it provides a way for applications to share information in a <i>live</I> way as OLE does (meaning that altering one document updates any linked documents, too), how you, the user, set up the link varies considerably from program to program. Another problem inherent in DDE is that the links it sets up between documents are too easy to sever. Simply moving a file to a new location or upgrading one of the source applications could result in a document losing one of its objects.</P>
<p>Since OLE&#146;s debut (with Windows 3.1), the bulk of serious Windows applications support OLE rather than DDE for user-created data sharing. Few programs used DDE internally to communicate between modules of a program or between multiple documents running under the same program. DDE has essentially been left to the domain of hackers working with such tools as Excel macros&#151;one of the few DDE-enabled tools.</TABLE>

</P>
<p>In the case of linking, two separate files exist: In the top part of Figure 8.13, the files are a Paint image and a Word file. The image can be edited either from within the Word document or separately in the Paint application.</P>
<p>By contrast, the bottom part of Figure 8.13 displays an <i>embedded</I> object. The embedded graphic is more intimately connected to the word processing document. In fact, it is contained <i>within</I> the word processing file itself. Although the embedded picture can still be edited, it doesn&#146;t have a life outside the word processing document that contains it.</P>
<p>Regardless of whether the objects in the word processing document are linked or embedded, the resulting larger document is called a <i>compound</I> document. A compound document is any document composed of two or more dissimilar document types joined via OLE.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Servers, Clients, Containers, and Other Terms</B></FONT></P>
<p>Let&#146;s look a little more closely at how applications work together to create compound documents. First, consider that programs play two separate and distinct roles in the process of sharing information through OLE. One program originates the object that is to be embedded or linked. This is referred to as the OLE <i>server</I>. The other program accepts the object. This is referred to as the OLE <i>client</I>. For example, in Figure 8.13, Paint and Excel are the originating (server) programs and in both cases Word is the accepting (client) program.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>To be absolutely precise, the terminology varies somewhat depending on whether you&#146;re speaking of OLE 1 or OLE 2. In OLE 2, the overall design model suggests the terms <i>container</I> and <i>component object </I>rather than <i>client</I> and <i>server</I>. The container is the receiver of any component object. For example, a word processing document containing a graph would be the container; the graph would be the component object. You&#146;ll probably be seeing these terms bandied about in the trade press, so the discussion here incorporates these terms from time to time.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Sophisticated Windows applications usually will work both as OLE servers and as clients. As an example, consider a spreadsheet program such as Excel. This program can supply charts and worksheet objects to a word processor or desktop publishing program, acting as an OLE server. Excel can also accept embedded database objects from, say, Access or Q&#38;E.
</P>
<p>This bidirectionality isn&#146;t always the case, however. For example, Windows Write, WordPad, and Cardfile can function only as clients. Programs such as Paint, Media Player, and Sound Recorder can behave only as servers.</P>
<p>Two final terms you need to know are <i>source</I> and <i>destination</I>. The <i>source document</I> (a close kin of the OLE server program) is the one in which an object is originally created. A <i>destination document</I> (similarly, this one is kin to the OLE client program) is the one into which you place the object.</P><p><br></P>
