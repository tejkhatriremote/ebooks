<p><big><big>M</BIG></BIG>ultimedia&#151;few terms have been used so much that confuse so many. Just what is multimedia, anyway?</P>
<p>Multimedia applications integrate different media&#151;graphics (two-dimensional and sometimes three-dimensional), digital video, wave audio, and synthesized music&#151;to more dramatically present information on just about any subject. A picture is worth a thousand words. For instance, it may be interesting to read about a cheetah running at 70 mph, but it&#146;s far more compelling to see a digital video clip of this majestic animal sprinting across a field. Reading text about how music sounds doesn&#146;t tell us much, but hearing it, maybe with an annotated narration, can convey far more information than just text on a screen. Computer games are a kind of multimedia; they use all these capabilities to create a compelling environment for you to enter.</P>
<p>A great example of multimedia and game programs is Broderbund&#146;s Myst, which combines both gracefully. The program takes you into a world to try to solve a mystery; you are aided by digital video clips of characters giving you small amounts of information to piece together and unravel the entire story. Another fun multimedia program (sometimes referred to as an &#147;edutainment&#148; program) is Grolier&#146;s series of general and specialized encyclopedias on CD-ROM. In addition, most computer magazines now have a subscription option to receive a CD-ROM with demo programs and extra magazine content, along with the printed version of the magazine.</P>
<p>You can also create your own multimedia shows. For example, by peppering a computer-based slide presentation with digital video and audio clips, you can add panache to what might be an otherwise dreary business presentation.</P>
<p>Because previous versions of Windows NT were designed primarily for workstation applications, Microsoft didn&#146;t put much effort into making NT a multimedia-friendly operating system. In Windows 2000, along with a new user interface, Microsoft has increased the multimedia capabilities. The new abilities include being able to utilize the full range of DirectX 7&#146;s application programming interfaces (APIs).</P>
<p>In this chapter, we take a look at these enabling APIs and how they process multimedia data. Next, we step through installing multimedia hardware to run with Windows 2000. Then we explore Windows 2000&#146;s multimedia tools for viewing or listening to multimedia content.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Understanding How Multimedia Works in Windows 2000</FONT></H3>
<p>When Microsoft shipped Windows 95, one of the goals was to make it the ultimate gaming/multimedia platform. Windows 3.1 and Windows NT 3.5 had some functionality in these areas, but their behavior could be erratic, and multimedia hardware drivers sometimes made the whole systems unstable. What&#146;s more, writing games was difficult in Windows 3.1 and all but impossible in NT.
</P>
<p>Developers wrote many multimedia software programs for Windows 3.1, some of which were impressive. But they were plagued with hardware inconsistencies because of the wide variety of machines on which users ran these programs. Game developers are notorious for writing their programs straight to the hardware (especially true of graphics code), often bypassing many operating system components that normally handle graphics drawing routines. This programming style works fine provided you know exactly what hardware users will have. But because that wasn&#146;t the case, some programs would crash running on certain kinds of hardware, which was a real nightmare for users.</P>
<p>To remedy the problem, Microsoft developed a set of APIs known collectively as DirectX. An API is a piece of <i>middleware</I>, to which developers write their programs, rather than writing directly to hardware. The key concept with DirectX is <i>hardware abstraction</I>, whereby software developers don&#146;t need to worry about their programs being able to &#147;talk&#148; to specific hardware. Hardware vendors, in turn, write their drivers to the API. In addition to eliminating many compatibility nightmares, these APIs are much faster at handling their respective duties than their predecessors, a requirement for great multimedia. Figure 7.1 shows how applications get at the DirectX APIs, which in turn communicate with your multimedia hardware.</P>

<p>Windows 2000 handles DirectX a little differently than NT 4 did. NT 4 only included a small subset of the DirectX APIs, thus having limited multimedia capabilities. Windows 2000, on the other hand, has implemented the entire DirectX 7 API set. This fact alone makes Windows 2000 superior to NT 4 for multimedia. In Windows 2000, there are essentially two layers of DirectX support: The DirectX Foundation layer provides the low-level hardware services for things like video accelerators and joysticks; the DirectX Media layer provides high level support for media streaming (digital audio and video), animation, and interactivity. Let&#146;s take a quick tour of the two layers of DirectX support.
