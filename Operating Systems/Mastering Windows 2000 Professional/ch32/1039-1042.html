<p>One last possibility is that there is a problem with your document. It is possible that you will be able to print a less complex document from the same application. If this is the case, the problem is probably within the application.

<h3><a name="Heading12"></A><font color="#000077">Troubleshooting Windows 2000 Setup</FONT></H3>
<p>Many people encounter problems during the installation of Windows 2000, though most of the problems are minor and can be easily avoided. This section helps with troubleshooting the more difficult setup issues.
</P>
<p>In this section, we talk about troubleshooting Setup on the Intel and compatible platforms. The techniques work well for machines that are on the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) and also for most machines that aren&#146;t on the list. Why would you want to install Windows 2000 on a &#147;non-compatible&#148; system? Ever build your own computer? It wouldn&#146;t likely be on the HCL unless you want to pay Microsoft to test your computer and certify it for Windows 2000.</P>
<p>We&#146;ve broken this section into parts that address problems you might encounter when planning for or during the text mode portion of Setup, during the transition to GUI mode, and during the final phase of rebooting.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading13"></A><font color="#000077">Planning and Text Mode Setup</FONT></H4>
<p>If you can restrain yourself from simply tearing the shrink-wrap from the box and whipping the CD-ROM out to start Setup, you should think about some things before you begin. Does your computer meet or exceed all the requirements? You may want to take the time to consult Chapter 20, &#147;Installing Windows 2000 (and Automating Installation),&#148; again for setup guidance and hardware requirements. Assuming that you have, and your computer meets all the requirements, there are some additional points you will want to document before starting.
</P>
<p>What cards are installed in your computer? Do you have a network card? A sound card? What about a 3-D accelerator card? Do you have the settings for all these devices written down? Remember that Windows 2000 is a Plug-and-Play operating system; it can find the settings for most of your hardware on its own, but you should still know what those settings are in case it can&#146;t find them. Do you have all the drivers for these devices under Windows 2000? Are the drivers on floppy disk or CD-ROM where you can get to them easily? Or are they on a network share? By the way, it won&#146;t do you any good to have your network card drivers out on a network server somewhere if you don&#146;t already have a functioning network card. Keep these handy on a floppy disk. Use Table 32.1 as a guide for the information you should have on hand prior to running Setup.</P>

<p>If in doubt about what hardware is installed in your computer, a tool included on the Windows 2000 CD-ROM can help. The NT Hardware Qualifier (NTHQ) tool, located in <tt>\Support\Hqtool</TT>, is a utility that runs from a bootable floppy and creates a text file containing all this information about your installed hardware. To use the tool, follow these steps:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Insert your Windows 2000 CD-ROM and change to the <tt>\Support\Hqtool</TT> folder.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Insert a formatted floppy in drive A.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Run the MAKEDISK tool found in the <tt>\Support\Hqtool</TT> folder.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reboot your computer using the floppy.
<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow the directions on screen.
</DL>
<p>There is also another similar tool for detecting the SCSI devices in your computer. Follow these directions to use the SCSItool:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Insert your Windows 2000 CD-ROM and change to the <tt>\Support\SCSItool</TT> folder.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Insert a formatted floppy in drive A.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Run the MAKEDISK tool found in the <tt>\Support\SCSItool</TT> folder.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reboot your computer using the floppy.
<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow the directions on screen.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The SCSItool works only with Adaptec or BusLogic SCSI controllers. If you have a different controller, you may be able to obtain the same information by using the BIOS of the controller or an additional program provided by the manufacturer.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Now let&#146;s look at another troubleshooting scenario involving setup issues. In this situation, imagine you are the person responsible for installing Windows 2000 Professional and for providing general technical support to a group of users.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Scenario 3: Drives Not Found</B></FONT></P>
<p>You are responsible for installing Windows 2000 Professional on a computer for one of the users in your department. You build and use the four Setup floppies to boot the computer and begin Setup. When Setup reaches the point where it displays your current disk and partition information, Setup displays the following error message:
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
   Setup did not find any hard drives on your computer.
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>You know that there are two hard drives in this computer and you can hear them spinning, so you know that they are receiving power. The first step in our troubleshooting methodology is to explore the boundaries of the problem.
</P>
<p>You open the case of the computer to find out exactly what kind of hard drives are installed (after turning off the power, of course). You find that the drives are SCSI-2 2.1GB, and that they are attached to an Adaptec 2940 controller. No other SCSI devices are installed in this computer. When you investigate, you find that this computer is newly updated from IDE hard drives and has not had any operating system running on it since the upgrade.</P><p><br></P>
