<h3><a name="Heading4"></A><font color="#000077">Using the Novell Administration Utilities</FONT></H3>
<p>To help you set up these myriad directories&#151;users directory, trustee directory, and file attributes&#151;NetWare comes with a complete set of network utilities to help you set up access rights. Of these, the main utility for administrative purposes is known as the <i>system configuration utility</I> (SYSCON for short) for NetWare 2.<i>x</I> and 3.<i>x</I> and NETADMIN for NetWare 4.<i>x</I> (NWADMIN is the Windows version of this utility). NetWare 5.<i>x</I> brings a new administration tool, ConsoleOne. With SYSCON and NETADMIN, you can set up accounting and metering features and set time restrictions for user logons. For example, let&#146;s say that Jane has rights to use the file server only on Monday through Friday, from 8:00 <small>AM</SMALL> to 3:00 <small>PM</SMALL>. If she tries to log on at 4:00 <small>PM</SMALL> Friday she will get an &#147;access denied&#148; or &#147;invalid logon&#148; error message. ConsoleOne is a one-stop tool for administering both a NetWare 5 server, and NDS. Accessed from a NetWare client, ConsoleOne gives you full access to the administration duties of your NetWare network with one tool. ConsoleOne is shown in Figure 25.1.</P>
<p><a name="Fig1"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch25/images/25-01.jpg',638,476)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch25/images/25-01t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch25/images/25-01.jpg',638,476)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 25.1</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The ConsoleOne tool enables you to manage your NetWare 5 network from Windows 2000.</P>
<p>With ConsoleOne you can create users, groups, and Organizational Units (OUs). You can set trustee rights for the containers in your NDS tree, and set directory rights. Essentially, the functions of SYSCON and NETADMIN have been combined into a single tool that can be run either from the new GUI of NetWare 5 or from any Windows-based client. That&#146;s the good news.
</P>
<p>The bad news for people who want to use Windows 2000 Professional to manage their NetWare 5 network is that the tool does not have full functionality with Microsoft&#146;s Client Services for NetWare. As with NT 4 and earlier, you must map a drive letter to access the Sys volume before you can run any NetWare administration tool. UNC paths will not work at all with these tools. If you are serious about managing your NetWare environment from within Windows 2000, you should strongly consider downloading Novell&#146;s Client32 when it is available for Windows 2000.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading5"></A><font color="#000077">Talking to NetWare 3.<i>x</I> Servers vs. Talking to an NDS Tree
</FONT></H3>
<p>Face it; you have to be aware of some facts of life regarding Novell and its three primary network operating systems&#151;NetWare 3.<i>x</I>, 4.<i>x</I>, and 5.<i>x</I>. The heart of the difference lies in the way that NetWare versions view and handle security and validation of users. NetWare 4.<i>x</I> and 5.<i>x</I> both use NetWare Directory Services (NDS), which is an X.500 directory structure, very much like Windows 2000&#146;s Active Directory.</P>
<p>A NetWare 3.<i>x</I> server holds its security information in a security database called the <i>bindery</I>. The bindery method of security views each server as an individual entity and the security that you assign to various directories and print queues is kept independently on each server. On the other hand, the NDS method of security that NetWare 4.<i>x</I> and 5.<i>x</I> use no longer treats each server as an independent unit, but instead treats a conglomeration of servers as a single unit called a <i>tree</I>. As a matter of fact, we really don&#146;t care about the individual server in NetWare 4.<i>x</I> and 5.<i>x</I>. Instead we look to the different resources or <i>objects</I> that are being offered on each server, and the NDS tree keeps track of these objects and controls access to them.</P>
<p>To illustrate the difference, assume that you had to build 100 user accounts on 5 NetWare servers and that each of the 100 users needed access to the 5 NetWare servers. If you were building these accounts in a NetWare 3.<i>x</I> environment, you would have to build 500 user accounts&#151;each of the 100 users on each of the 5 servers. If you were building these accounts in a NetWare 4.<i>x</I> or 5.<i>x</I> environment, you would have to build only 100 user accounts because all 5 servers would be part of the same NDS tree; you have to log on to an NDS tree only once.</P>
<p>The reason that this difference is important to you at the Windows 2000 Professional level is that the levels of access and control that you have on a NetWare 3<i>.x</I> server are different than on a NetWare 4<i>.x</I> or 5.<i>x</I> server. Therefore, a Windows 2000 machine interacts with NetWare 3.<i>x</I> and 4.<i>x</I> or 5.<i>x</I> in different fashions.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading6"></A><font color="#000077">Accessing a NetWare Server</FONT></H4>
<p>After you install the Client Service for NetWare (discussed later, in the section &#147;Configuring Windows 2000 to Run in Parallel with NetWare&#148;), you can access the resources of a NetWare 3.<i>x</I> server as well as a NetWare 4.<i>x</I> or 5.<i>x</I> tree, as long as you have a valid login ID on the NetWare servers. The login scripts that reside on the Novell server will run even on your Windows 2000 workstation, mapping your drives and capturing your printer ports.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading7"></A><font color="#000077">Administering a NetWare Server from a Windows 2000 Computer</FONT></H4>
<p>After the Client Service for NetWare is installed, you can still go to the command line prompt and run SYSCON (the system console) on a NetWare 3.<i>x</I> server in order to build users, manage groups, and assign trustee rights to the various resources this NetWare server has to offer. Life proceeds normally as long as all you want to do is administer a 3.<i>x</I> server.</P>
<p>However, if you turn your attention to a NetWare 4<i>.x</I> server, life is much different. You cannot run the NETADMIN or NWADMIN utilities to manage a NetWare 4.<i>x</I> NDS tree. At this time the Client Service for NetWare does not support logging on to the NDS as administrator to allow direct administrative access to the NDS. Look for this to change in subsequent patches for this service, especially in the Service packs that Microsoft will release for this product.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Many administrators may have gotten around the NDS administration limitation in NT Workstation 4 with 32-bit Novell Administrator software provided by Novell. This utility does not work on Windows 2000. In most cases, it will bring your system to a screeching halt, generally making it difficult (if not impossible) to reboot Windows 2000. Look on Novell&#146;s Web site (<a href="www.novell.com">www.novell.com</A>) for the Windows 2000 version of the utility.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>NetWare 5.<i>x</I> uses the ConsoleOne tool to manage the network resources from a client computer. Currently, this tool won&#146;t work correctly with Windows 2000. To really use this tool&#146;s functions, you will need to install the Client32 software from Novell. The key issue appears to be some proprietary functions supplied in some dynamic link libraries (DLLs) that are installed with the Client32 software.</P><p><br></P>
