<p><big><big>I</BIG></BIG>f your business is like thousands of others around the world, there&#146;s a good chance you have a Novell NetWare network already in place. And if you&#146;ve just made the move to using Windows 2000 Professional, you&#146;ll be pleased to know that it&#146;s not difficult to connect your Windows 2000 computer to the Novell NetWare server. In other words, you&#146;ve come to the right chapter.</P>
<p>Microsoft provides a special solution for this situation, which it calls the Client Service for NetWare. The benefits of the Client Service for NetWare include the following:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>Novell script processing</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Client Service for NetWare processes the system and individual logon scripts created by the network administrator of the Novell network. Please note that the Client Service for NetWare still has limited support for NetWare Directory Services (NDS) in this iteration of Windows 2000; therefore, the script processing takes place when logging onto a NetWare 4.<i>x</I> or 5.<i>x</I> server.
<dd><b>Long filename support</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you enable OS/2 naming support on your Novell server, you can save files with names up to 254 characters in length. With the OS/2 naming support enabled, your NetWare server appears as a High Performance File System (HPFS) volume to the Windows 2000 client.
<dd><b>Single peripheral systems</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you are using the 32-bit drivers for connectivity, you can use the dial-up services that are part of the Microsoft enterprise network. Historically, Microsoft products have referred to the dial-up services as Remote Access Service (RAS), but in Windows 2000 Professional, this function is known as Dial-Up Networking. If you use the Client Service for NetWare, dial-up networking will enable you to attach directly to the Novell servers and process NetWare logon scripts remotely.
</DL>
<p>Before we look at the procedure for installing the Client Service for NetWare, let&#146;s look at the different versions of NetWare to which you may have to connect&#151;NetWare 3.<i>x</I>, 4.<i>x,</I> or 5.<i>x</I>. We will also look at the printing resources that are available to you after you install the Client Service for NetWare. We conclude this discussion with some notes about utilizing logon scripts and mapping drives to the NetWare servers.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Defining Novell&#146;s Point of View: Common Terms</FONT></H3>
<p>A lot of the concepts that you are familiar with in Windows 2000 are present in Novell NetWare. Let&#146;s take a moment to clarify the Novell terms.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">Novell Security</FONT></H4>
<p>NetWare security distinguishes four security issues:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The login procedure
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Trustee rights
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Directory rights
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;File attributes
</DL>
<p>Each of these levels provides a different and more complete level of security.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>The Login Procedure</B></FONT></P>
<p>Every time a user logs on to the network, she must provide her identification name and a password. This password is NetWare&#146;s guide to the access rights that the user has on the network. If the password has read-only rights attached to it, then that user can&#146;t modify files on the server. Conversely, if that password has full rights to a file server and all file servers are treated as one on the network (as in NetWare 4.<i>x</I> or 5.<i>x</I>), then that user has full rights to all servers.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Trustee Rights</B></FONT></P>
<p>Each user or group of users on a Novell network is considered a trustee. Each user has a list of possible rights or permissions linked to his or her password (as we saw above), including but not limited to:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading from open files
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing to open files
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening existing files
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating new files
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Deleting existing files
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting trustee rights for others at the directory/subdirectory level
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Modifying file attributes
</DL>
<p>Although these rights can apply evenly to entire disks, they don&#146;t necessarily have to. A network administrator can vary a user&#146;s rights according to a particular directory of a drive. In other words, you could have full access to most of a drive, but read-only access to a particular directory on that drive. This concept leads us to our next topic&#151;directory rights.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Directory Rights</B></FONT></P>
<p>Directory rights are similar to the directory permissions in Windows 2000. Although NetWare, by default, gives child directories (subdirectories) the same rights as their parent directories, each trustee can set the above rights for each directory and subdirectory on the network. Subdirectories do inherit the rights of their parent directories, just as they do in Windows 2000.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>File Attributes</B></FONT></P>
<p>As a final level of security, the network administrator can mark individual files with certain attributes that limit how and when users can use them, similar to setting file-level permissions in Windows 2000. (NetWare just has fewer of them.) These attributes are:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shareable vs. non-shareable. If a file is shareable, then if one person is using that file, others can access it as well. If a file is non-shareable, then no more than one person at a time can use (even read) that file.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Read/write vs. read-only.
</DL>
<p>You&#146;re probably pretty familiar with read/write and read-only file attributes. If a file is read-only, then any user with those rights can read it and make changes but can&#146;t save those changes to the original document. He could save those changes if he saved the amended file under another name, however. This kind of restriction is handy for a group project in which one person is in charge and other people are contributing. If the helpers can&#146;t modify the original, the person in charge has to incorporate only the changes that she approves. This process saves the helpers from frantically looking for the original file&#146;s backup after modifying the file in a way in which the project leader rejected. (And unless the helpers made a backup copy, the old file would no longer exist.)
</P>
<p>Any user with read/write capability (such as that project manager) could update a file and then save it under the same name as before, incorporating the new information. Again, a backup file must be made or the old file will no longer exist.</P><p><br></P>
