<h3><a name="Heading18"></A><font color="#000077">Wireless Networks</FONT></H3>
<p>Now that we&#146;ve talked about cables, let&#146;s briefly discuss a kind of network that doesn&#146;t use them: the wireless network.
</P>
<p>In recent years, several hardware companies have developed technology that enables computers to plug into a network without cables or connectors, as illustrated in Figure 22.1. This wireless connection requires a special network card in the network server, a receiving and broadcasting adapter for the computer to be connected, and an antenna that attaches to the server and thus broadcasts to and receives from the wireless workstation. The wireless nodes have a range of up to several hundred feet, but this range may be restricted by heavy steel or concrete floors or walls.</P>
<p><a name="Fig1"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch22/images/22-01.jpg',450,218)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch22/images/22-01t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch22/images/22-01.jpg',450,218)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 22.1</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wireless LAN</P>
<p>Why would you want a wireless LAN? Depending upon your situation, a wireless LAN could prove to be cost effective and convenient. The biggest chunk of your LAN&#146;s cost is the cabling, and the more difficult the cabling job, the more expensive that part of your LAN will be. A LAN that has no wires at all, or one that is partially wired and partially wireless, could save you money if your building is especially hard to wire. As for convenience, a wireless LAN could enable you to roam the building with a laptop or even go outside if you didn&#146;t go too far. For people who need to be mobile but also need instant access to the network (such as a stock person at a grocery store), wireless workstations are very handy.
</P>
<p>Although you can have either an entirely wireless LAN or a mixed LAN with wired and wireless nodes, most people would opt for the latter for a number of reasons. First, the wireless adapters and network cards are expensive (between $200 and $700 more per node than a wired Ethernet card), so you have to decide whether the more cost-effective option for you is to spend money on the wireless cards and adapters or on cables. Second, the wireless LANs really aren&#146;t made to take the place of wires. Their data transfer rates aren&#146;t especially high (242Kbps for one brand) and thus don&#146;t work well for anyone interested in moving large, data-intensive files. Light data transfer, such as small- to medium-sized text files, is about all that wireless connections can handle well.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading19"></A><font color="#000077">Specifics: The Network Interface Card</FONT></H3>
<p>One of the first decisions that you are going to have to make when purchasing hardware is the type of Network Interface Card to buy&#151;should it be Token Ring or Ethernet? We describe the differences between these two cards (besides their huge cost differential) in great detail when we discuss Token versus Ethernet logical topologies in the next chapter.
</P>
<p>Regardless of the type of card that you will purchase, all cards have certain standard features&#151;the settings that enable the cards to work correctly and to avoid hardware conflict with the other cards that are sitting in the computer. So we will begin our adventure by taking a look at IRQs, base I/O addresses, and DMAs.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading20"></A><font color="#000077">IRQs</FONT></H4>
<p>Sitting on your NIC are some memory chips. The purpose of these memory chips is to give packets that are addressed to your machine someplace to go when they arrive at your workstation. Unfortunately, the computer&#146;s CPU, which is the brains of the operation, cannot see that memory sitting on the NIC. Therefore, somebody has to move that information from the memory of the NIC to the main memory of your system so that the CPU can process it. The component charged with the task of moving information from the memory of the NIC to your main memory is also a CPU, but this CPU is located on the network adapter.
</P>
<p>If you open your computer, you will notice metal traces or wires sitting on the motherboard that act as pathways to connect various cards sitting in their bus slots to the CPU. Some of these pathways are known as interrupt request (IRQ) lines. You need to be concerned with 16 of them.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Because we are techie folk, we always start counting with the number zero. And so the IRQ numbers start from 0 and go all the way up to 15.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Each device that needs to use an IRQ must use a unique IRQ. Otherwise, you can expect your computer to crash! Using different IRQs for different cards in your system is not optional; it is imperative.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Windows 3.<i>x</I> sometimes lets you share IRQs with the assumption that only one of the devices would be in use at a time. Windows 9<i>x</I> doesn&#146;t like to share IRQs and often fails because of this. Windows NT and Windows 2000 do not allow you to share IRQs at all. Each device must have a separate and unique IRQ to function with Windows 2000.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Now you are wondering how to find out which IRQs are in use and which ones are available. If you are using Microsoft DOS 5.<i>x</I> or higher, you can run a utility known as Microsoft Diagnostics. It is sitting in your DOS directory. Simply type <b>MSD</B> at the DOS prompt to start it. Once inside MSD, type <b>Q</B> to get the IRQ status. In Windows 9<i>x</I> this information can be found in Device Manager by double-clicking Computer at the top of the device list. In Windows 2000 you can find the information grouping the Hardware Resources folder of the System Information console (<tt>winmsd.exe</TT>).</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading21"></A><font color="#000077">Base Memory Address</FONT></H4>
<p>The location that an adapter card occupies in memory is referred to as its base memory address or base I/O address. This is the location that the CPU goes to when it needs to exchange information with the adapter card. The IRQ (described above) is used to signal to the CPU that there is information waiting. Then the CPU accesses these memory addresses to retrieve that information. It can also work in reverse when the system is sending information to the network.
</P>
<p>This is one of the hardware resources that Windows 2000 needs to know about in order to access the adapter card&#146;s functions.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading22"></A><font color="#000077">Direct Memory Access&#151;Memory Movers</FONT></H4>
<p>The next order of business is to find out how DMA chips move the information from the NIC to main memory.
</P>
<p>Your motherboard contains two DMA chips, and each chip supports four DMA channels, making a total of eight DMA channels on your motherboard. (Again, because we are techie folk, they&#146;re numbered DMA0 through DMA7.) Every device that needs to use DMA must use a unique DMA channel. This topic is explored in detail in Chapter 24, &#147;Essentials of Windows 2000 Networking.&#148;</P><p><br></P>
