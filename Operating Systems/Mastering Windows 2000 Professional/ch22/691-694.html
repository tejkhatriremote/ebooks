<p>Distance can adversely affect cables if they aren&#146;t designed to deal with it. Here are the three ways distance most often affects cables:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Signal strength and quality (attenuation)
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Possibility of packet collision
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Susceptibility to RF noise
</DL>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Attenuation</B></FONT></P>
<p>Some kinds of cable just aren&#146;t capable of extending very far, due to their inability to maintain signal quality and strength over a certain distance. This capability of a cable varies according to the thickness and composition of its conducting wire and its type of insulating material. Twisted-pair, which consists of copper wires surrounded by an insulator, is one example of cable affected by attenuation. You can get around attenuation problems with devices such as repeaters.
</P>
<p><i>Repeaters</I> are devices that &#147;repeat&#148; a signal so that it can travel a distance that would otherwise be too long to maintain proper signal strength. These devices repeat the transmission signal, enabling your network to extend farther than it ordinarily could. They&#146;re not exactly internetworking devices but rather devices to extend an existing network a little farther. Imagine that you and a friend are standing at a little distance from each other, calling back and forth. So long as you don&#146;t move too far apart, you can hear each other fine. If you move too far, though, you either won&#146;t hear what your friend said or it&#146;ll come out garbled. In that case, you&#146;d need a repeater (perhaps a mutual friend) to stand in the middle and relay messages. In the same way, a repeater receives packets and either amplifies them or retransmits them as new so that the packet can go farther across your network.</P>
<p>Your best defense against the terrible threat of attenuation is a good repeater.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Possibility of Packet Collision</B></FONT></P>
<p>Long cable runs can throw off the timing of packets moving through a network. On an Ethernet system, each node transmits for itself, sending a packet of information to wherever it needs to go on the network. If two nodes transmit at the same time, their packets collide and they must retransmit, which takes time. Therefore, before a node sends out its packet, it &#147;listens&#148; to see if the network is clear.
</P>
<p>Think of it like this: Suppose you are a stock clerk in a warehouse that stocks very large boulders&#151;rather like the one in <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</I>. Each small stockroom in your warehouse opens onto a large corridor. If you need to move boulders from one stockroom to another, you certainly can&#146;t do it at the same time that someone else is moving another boulder because they won&#146;t fit past each other. So you must first listen out your door to make sure that the coast is clear before beginning the move. The rolling boulders make enough noise to alert you when other stock clerks are moving boulders.</P>
<p>What happens, however, if your warehouse expands and the corridor becomes longer (but no wider)? You might not be able to hear stock clerks moving boulders at the far end of the corridor, so you might hear nothing and head out with your boulder&#151;and run into your colleague. Although you might expect that only one of you has to return to their stockroom until the other one has passed, the company rules are that both of you have to return to your respective stockrooms and wait a preset time before venturing out again.</P>
<p>Time wasting, isn&#146;t it? The above situation is analogous to what happens if you use cables that are too long for your Ethernet topologies. The nodes can&#146;t &#147;hear&#148; the other nodes at the far end of the cable and so transmit at the same time, causing the packets to collide and requiring the nodes to resend them. This kind of problem could seriously slow down a network because there&#146;s no guarantee that the packets wouldn&#146;t collide on the <i>next</I> try, either.</P>
<p>This situation can be troublesome with only two people attempting to access the network cable, but imagine how monumental this problem can become if a thousand people are attempting to access the network.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Susceptibility to RF Noise</B></FONT></P>
<p>As we discussed before, wires are affected by RF noise and therefore act as antennas. The longer a wire is, the better antenna it makes&#151;that&#146;s why, if you want to improve the signal on your car radio, you pull the antenna out farther. Also, the longer a cable is, the more likely it is to pick up RF noise that interferes with transmission. A poorly insulated cable is liable to pick up RF noise under the best of circumstances, and the longer it is, the more chances the noise has to interfere with it.
</P>
<h3><a name="Heading29"></A><font color="#000077">Types of Cables</FONT></H3>
<p>The first solution to the interference problem led to the development of various kinds of protection against interference. Conductors can be protected from RF noise by insulating them with another conductor. This kind of protection is seen in twisted-pair and coaxial cables.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading30"></A><font color="#000077">Twisted-Pair</FONT></H4>
<p>Twisted-pair cable is made of several pairs of two wires intertwined along their entire length. Because each wire is a conductor, wrapping the wires over each other serves to insulate each wire from RF noise. The two kinds of twisted-pair cable are <i>shielded twisted-pair</I> (STP) and <i>unshielded twisted-pair</I> (UTP). The only difference between them is that in STP a conducting layer surrounds the twisted wires, providing an extra layer of protection from interference. STP costs a little more than UTP, but it is more immune to outside RF noise and therefore can run in places where UTP would not work well.</P>
<p>You can see what UTP looks like in Figure 22.2 and what STP looks like in Figure 22.3.</P>

<p>The Electronics Industry Association (EIA), Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA), and National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) established a five-level standard and commissioned Underwriters Laboratories (UL) to certify cable as meeting the EIA/TIA-586 standards. The higher the grade number, the more twists per foot and the better attenuation&#151;that is, the less interference will affect the conducting wire.
