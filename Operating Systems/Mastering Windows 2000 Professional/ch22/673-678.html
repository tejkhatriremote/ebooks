<p><big><big>B</BIG></BIG>y now, you&#146;re fully aware that the operating system on your computer is Windows 2000 Professional, and that it was designed as a <i>network</I> operating system. You&#146;ve patiently read through the earlier chapters, learning all there is to know about using Windows 2000 Professional on your own, but you&#146;re intensely interested in learning the best way to set up your network. And by &#147;set up,&#148; you mean you want the nitty-gritty: You want to know what&#146;s <i>physically</I> involved. You want advice about cabling and connectors, protocols and topologies, and a heads-up about any additional software you might need to connect to or install your own network.</P>
<p>Well, you asked for it. In this part of the book, you&#146;ll get five chapters of detailed information on networks&#151;probably more than you need to get started with your installation, but, as with so many complicated topics, the more you know, the better off you&#146;ll be in the long run.</P>
<p>This chapter is designed to take you through the theories and preliminaries of planning a network. We begin with a look at various ways to use a network successfully and then present the types of cables that can be used for networking.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Early Networking: Sneakernet</FONT></H3>
<p>The oldest form of the computer network is commonly referred to as the <i>Sneakernet</I>, an official-sounding name for a very unofficial way of doing business. In this popular networking arrangement, a user would copy information to a floppy disk, put on a good pair of Reeboks, and run the file over to another machine or user. Not a very efficient method of sharing information by today&#146;s standards, but it got the job done. For some purposes, it may still be the best way to get information from one place to another.</P>
<p>Though wonderful for encouraging interoffice interaction, Sneakernet poses a few serious disadvantages. Losing data is a big risk with this system because if you misplace or accidentally reformat the data disk, you lose the information. Making sure that everyone who&#146;s working on a document or spreadsheet is working with the same information is also cumbersome:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens if you have a copy of the original disk and someone makes changes to the original without telling you?
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens if more than one person is working on a document and you need to incorporate everyone&#146;s changes into one copy?
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you keep people from leaving the building with disks full of sensitive information?
</DL>
<p>Obviously, if you want data integrity, security, and the best use of the creativity of all the people working on a document (and who doesn&#146;t?), Sneakernet is not the way to go. What you need instead is some way of tying your network together other than having to rely on the trustworthiness and good will of your coworkers. What you need is a LAN.
</P>
<h3><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">LAN: The Alternative</FONT></H3>
<p>Strictly speaking, a <i>local area network</I> (LAN) is a group of computers that are connected within a certain area. LANs vary greatly in size&#151;you can make a LAN out of two computers sitting across from each other in the same room or out of several thousand computers in the same building. The key part to the definition of a LAN is that all the computers on the network are <i>grouped together in some fashion and are connected</I>.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>A network that extends over a larger area, such as a city block or a country, is known as a w<i>ide area network</I> or WAN. We&#146;ve also run across the abbreviations MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) and CAN (Citywide Area Network), but most of the time citywide networks are referred to as WANs.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>On most LANs, cables connect the LAN by linking the network cards that reside within each computer or printer on the network. We talk about situations where cable is <i>not</I> the means of connection later in the section &#147;Wireless Networks.&#148;</P>
<p>The preceding definition is the strict, textbook definition. However, in the real world, LANs are generally defined less by their physical characteristics and more by their function. In this sense, a LAN is a system in which linked computers and peripheral devices can share common information, software applications, printers, scanners, fax services, CD-ROMs, and/or the use of group scheduling programs and e-mail. The quick electronic dispersal of computer-generated information to people striving toward a common goal and existing in a single-user-per-computer environment truly defines a local area network.</P>
<p>With a LAN, you can do all of the following:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Perform file-management tasks
<dl>
<br>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Share files
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer files
</DL>
<br>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Share applications
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Share peripheral devices
<dl>
<br>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Printers
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;CD-ROMs
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Scanners
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fax modems
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tape drives
</DL>
<br>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Interact with other users on the network
<dl>
<br>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule group meetings
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Send and receive e-mail
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold electronic meetings
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Play network games
