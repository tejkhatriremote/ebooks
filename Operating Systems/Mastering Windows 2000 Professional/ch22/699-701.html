<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading32"></A><font color="#000077">Fiber-Optic Cable</FONT></H4>
<p>Here are two new terms for your techie cocktail party (you know, the one where everybody tries to out-tech each other): electronic medium and photonic medium. The cables that we have discussed up to this point have been electronic; they conduct electronic signals. Fiber-optic cable, on the other hand, conducts photonic signals, or light.
</P>
<p>Fiber-optic cable is indifferent to RF noise because of the difference in its conductive medium: Whereas twisted-pair and coaxial cable transmit with electronic signals, fiber-optic cable transmits using light. The light is conducted along a slender plastic or glass fiber that has a thin coating called <i>cladding</I>. The fiber is then surrounded by a plastic jacket intended to protect the delicate fiber.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>You&#146;ve probably seen fiber optics in action. Remember the feather lamps so popular in the late 1970s and early &#146;80s? Each strand on those lamps is a fiber-optic strand.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Take a look at Figure 22.6 to see the structure of a fiber-optic cable.
</P>
<p><a name="Fig6"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch22/images/22-06.jpg',500,139)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch22/images/22-06t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch22/images/22-06.jpg',500,139)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 22.6</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiber-optic cable</P>
<p>In Figure 22.6, the straight, darker wires running more or less horizontally from left to right are the fibers with cladding on them and the feathery stuff is insulation.
</P>
<p>Fiber-optic cable has many advantages over either coax or twisted-pair. Fiber-optic cable is completely resistant to electromagnetic and radio frequencies, and the signal is sometimes able to travel <i>several miles</I> without any degradation. In addition, tapping into fiber-optic cable and intercepting the signals is more difficult than gaining unauthorized access to either coax or twisted-pair cable, so fiber-optic is a popular cable for top-secret communications. Most importantly, fiber-optic cable supports very high speeds of transmissions.</P>
<p>How does fiber transmit data? Information travels along a fiber-optic cable by means of a light-emitting diode (LED) that sends signals through the core of the fiber-optic cable. These devices are generically called <i>codecs</I>&#151;coder/decoders. When the signal reaches the receiving end of the transmission, it is reconstructed back into its original form with a photo-diode. If the sending and receiving sources of the transmission are very far apart, then a device called a fiber-optic repeater may be placed at strategic locations to amplify the signal so that it arrives at its destination at full strength.</P>
<p>Fiber-optic cabling doesn&#146;t limit you to one path for your data. As you saw in Figure 22.6, each cable can have more than one fiber in it, enabling data to move to its destination more quickly. The more fibers the cable has, the more data can pass through the cable at any given time, just as a four-lane highway can carry more traffic than a single-lane road. Also, fiber-optic cable comes in a wide variety of sizes, some intended for outside work and some for inside, as shown in Figure 22.7.</P>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The thick black cable in Figure 22.7 is about &#189;-inch thick and very stiff (it&#146;s outside cable), whereas the thinner gray one is about <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch22/images/22-02i.jpg">-inch in diameter (and is commonly used indoors).<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Some fiber-optic cables run information in both directions like the slender gray cable does in Figure 22.7, but some cables are like two-lane streets; traffic in each lane goes in only one direction, so each direction has its own lane: one to come, and one to go.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Types of Fiber-Optic Cable</B></FONT></P>
<p>The two types of fiber-optic cable are <i>single mode</I> (or monomode) and <i>multimode</I>.</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>Single mode</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends the light signal along a single path. This type of transmission is used for networks that need very high rates of data transfer, such as long distance telephones or Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI).
<dd><b>Multimode</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Contains several light signals that move along inside the cable. The two kinds of multimode cable are <i>step index</I> and <i>graded index</I>.
<dl>
<br>
<dd><b>Step index</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The light beams bounce around inside the cable in a zigzag pattern.
<dd><b>Graded index</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The light movement has a more rounded pattern like a sine wave.
</DL>
<br>
</DL>
<p>Both kinds of multimode cable are prone to modal dispersion&#151;spreading of the received light impulse&#151;due to the number of light beams traveling through the cable. When the signal spreads, it moves more slowly, so single-mode cable transmits faster than multimode cable. To understand why, try imagining what happens if you throw a ball down a pipe. If you toss just one ball and it goes through without hitting the walls of the pipe, it would move faster and more accurately than if it bounced off the walls of the pipe. Just as bouncing off the walls of the pipe slows the ball&#146;s traveling speed, bouncing off the walls of the cable slows down the light signal.
</P>
<p>With its 155Mbps throughput, fiber-optic cable has had notable success as the LAN backbone. Because it&#146;s still costly to run this type of cable for the entire system, only high-powered engineering or graphics applications seem to make use of it for local segments. Certainly a cost advantage can be realized by opting to run UTP to connect your workstations, which allows you the flexibility to upgrade to fiber-optic as prices go down.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Advantages and Disadvantages</B></FONT></P>
<p>Fiber-optic cable has a lot of advantages and two disadvantages. On the plus side are its huge data transfer rates (up to 155Mbps), especially useful for transferring video or audio images generally referred to as multimedia. Because fiber-optic transmits light, not electricity, fiber-optic is immune to electrical interference. Some kinds of fiber-optic can transmit up to 3 miles in LAN environments and across the country via a high-power laser device in WAN environments. Fiber-optic cable is also useful in hazardous environments: First, it can&#146;t spark (as electric transfer cables could), and second, it doesn&#146;t have any metal in it, so it resists corrosion. Finally, fiber-optic cabling is harder to tap into than coaxial or twisted-pair cable, so it&#146;s more secure. (Of course, no cable is totally immune from tapping.)
</P>
<p>As you might have guessed, fiber&#146;s two disadvantages are cost related. First, the fiber-optic cable is far more expensive than either coax or twisted-pair. Second, it is generally more difficult to install, so its installation costs are higher. Fiber-optic is dropping in price as it becomes more common, however, so don&#146;t eliminate it from your list of possibilities just because of cost. If nothing else, you could follow the example of companies that run a fiber backbone and use high-grade UTP for taps to the nodes.</P>
<p>One disadvantage that fiber-optic <i>doesn&#146;t</I> have is flexibility. If you were concerned that cable with a glass fiber would be fragile and limited to running in a straight line, think again.</P><p><br></P>
