<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading4"></A><font color="#000077">File Management: Sharing and Transferring Files</FONT></H4>
<p>One of the primary purposes of a LAN is to provide a common storage area so that several people can access the same files. File sharing can help ensure that only one version of a file is circulating at a time so that anyone who uses that file is always working with the most recent version. If you don&#146;t want to share a file with the network but you need someone else to do some work on it, you can transfer the file to someone else&#151;just move it from your directory to theirs or else send it as an e-mail message.
</P>
<p>We would like to point out that the act of sharing a file with the network does <i>not</I> automatically give everyone on the network access to it. In many network operating systems, you can attach a password to your files so that only people who have the password can access them. In most network operating systems, you can determine whether other users will have full access or read-only access to your files, directories, and hard drives. This capability can keep others from seeing your work or prevent them from making changes to your work when they&#146;re not supposed to.</P>
<p>Sharing, transferring, and securing information between computers on a network is generally known as <i>file management</I>. You can share entire drives and directories&#151;you&#146;re not limited to sharing individual files.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>As with individual files, you can restrict access to your shared resources (printers, CD-ROMs, scanners, tape drives, etc.) with passwords.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading5"></A><font color="#000077">Concurrent Use of Applications</FONT></H4>
<p>Many, but not all, software packages will work fine if you install them onto the <i>file server</I> and let people access them from their workstations. Here are a few of the advantages to locating software centrally (that is, on a file server):</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It frees disk space on individual computers. The bulk of the applications is stored on the file server and not at each user&#146;s computer.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;More than one user can use an application at one time (almost a necessity in many database applications).
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Upgrading software is easier because the application that needs to be updated is the copy of the software that is installed on the server. This feature is not true of all software packages. Some, like Windows, have a certain number of files that need to be updated at each user&#146;s computer even though the major part of Windows is located on the file server. These files usually include configuration information that is specific to each computer system in your office.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you store applications on a file server and let users access them from their workstations, <i>you are still required to buy more than one license</I>. You should have proper software licensing for every user, even if you only loaded one copy of the software onto the server. If you don&#146;t have proper licenses for all your users, you are committing software piracy&#151;stealing from the developers of that software. Software piracy is a federal crime.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>LAN-dependent applications, such as e-mail, are usually licensed for a specific number of users. When you access the program from the file server, a full-blown copy of the program is transported from the hard drive of the file server to the memory of your computer. As you interact with the program, you are interacting with the copy that is stored in the memory of your computer. If you activate a new feature of the program, such as invoking the spell-check feature of your favorite word processing program, then the spell-check portion of the word processing program is transported from the hard drive of the file server to the memory of your computer. For every computer that will store part of the program in its memory, you need a license for the program.
</P>
<p>Again, having more users than your LAN-dependent application allows is still considered software piracy.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading6"></A><font color="#000077">Peripheral Sharing</FONT></H4>
<p>A lot of people get confused about the nature of peripherals these days because you no longer have to attach a modem to your computer: Many people use modem cards that sit inside the PC. To assist you with visualizing exactly what a peripheral device is, consider it anything that is external to the CPU and memory.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The words <i>peripheral device</I> and <i>peripheral</I> are just tech-speak for &#147;a device that attaches to your computer system.&#148; Printers, scanners, sound cards, CD-ROM players, fax modems, and joysticks are all peripheral devices. The CPU is the central processing unit.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>A LAN enables its users to share high-cost peripheral devices and manage them so that two users do not attempt to use the devices simultaneously.
</P>
<p>Peripheral sharing saves network users time and money. Of course, even without a network, you don&#146;t have to buy printers or other expensive peripheral devices for every workstation in the office. One or two devices will work just as well&#151;if people don&#146;t mind standing in line to use them. However, if people must wait for a device to be free, you are spending the money you saved (by not buying the extra printer) on wasted time.</P>
<p>As with file management, a network administrator can restrict access to the peripheral devices on a network so that only those people authorized to use them can access them. For example, you may not want people to print out rough drafts or r&#233;sum&#233;s on the $8,000 color printer.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading7"></A><font color="#000077">Group Scheduling</FONT></H4>
<p>Group scheduling could be one of your office manager&#146;s favorite network features. Organizing departmental meetings can be an administrator&#146;s nightmare, as he or she tries to sort through everyone&#146;s schedules to find a time when everyone can meet. Group scheduling software can make this nightmarish task much more manageable.
</P>
<p>Group scheduling software keeps track of all users&#146; schedules, either separately or together as one large calendar. Each person on the network keeps track of his or her own appointments in the virtual day planner. This information is automatically stored in a central database.</P>
<p>Now, let&#146;s say that you want to call a meeting of all the MIS people in your company. All that you have to do is list the names of the people who should attend this meeting and then choose a date. The computer can tell you of any scheduling conflicts and let you modify the meeting time accordingly. Some scheduling software packages let you tell the computer to choose the first time that everyone is available, to save you the trouble of having to guess. After you&#146;ve settled on a time, you can use the scheduling program to send &#147;invitations&#148; and ask people to confirm their attendance.</P>
<p>Some group scheduling software enables users on the network to see or modify each other&#146;s schedules, but only if the owner of the schedule permits it.</P><p><br></P>
