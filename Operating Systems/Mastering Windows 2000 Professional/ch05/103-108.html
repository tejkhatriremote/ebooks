</DL>
<p><big><big>Y</BIG></BIG>ou can make numerous alterations to customize Windows 2000 to your liking&#151;adjustments to screen colors, modems, mouse speed, passwords, key repeat rate, fonts, and networking options, to name just a few. Most of these adjustments are not necessities as much as they are niceties that make using Windows 2000 just a little easier. Others are more imperative, such as setting up Windows 2000 to work with your brand and model of printer, setting up Windows Messaging preferences for your e-mail, or getting your mouse pointer to slow down a bit so you can reasonably control it.</P>
<p>You can set preferences of this sort through Windows 2000&#146;s Control Panel. After you change a setting with the Control Panel, alterations are stored in the Windows configuration Registry. The settings are reloaded each time you run Windows 2000 and stay in effect until you change them again with the Control Panel.</P>
<p>A few Control Panel settings can be altered from other locations throughout Windows 2000. For example, you can set up printers from the Start <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch05/images/05-01i.jpg"> Settings <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch05/images/05-02i.jpg"> Printers command, and you can change your screen&#146;s settings by right-clicking the Desktop. However, such approaches essentially run the Control Panel option responsible for the relevant settings, so the Control Panel is still doing the work. Running the Control Panel to make system changes is often easier because it displays all the options for controlling your system in one place. This chapter discusses how you work with the Control Panel and delves into what the multiple settings are good for.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Not all the Control Panel settings are discussed in detail in this chapter. Those that pertain to larger topics, such as networking, printing, multimedia, and communications, are covered in greater depth in their respective chapters later in the book. Those that don&#146;t fall into a single chapter are gathered into Chapter 31, &#147;Additional Customization Options.&#148;<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Opening the Control Panel</FONT></H3>
<p>You open the Control Panel by clicking the Start button, choosing Settings, and choosing Control Panel. The Control Panel can also be reached from My Computer or from Explorer. From Explorer, scroll the left pane to the top and click the My Computer icon. Then double-click Control Panel in the right pane. The Control Panel window is shown in Figure 5.1.
</P>
<p><a name="Fig1"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch05/images/05-01.jpg',610,510)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch05/images/05-01t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch05/images/05-01.jpg',610,510)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 5.1</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Control Panel window. Each item opens a window from which you can make adjustments.</P>
<p>In your Control Panel, there will be as many as 20 or so items to choose from, depending on your computer&#146;s hardware, software, and which items you opted for during installation of Windows 2000. As you add new software or hardware to your system, you&#146;ll occasionally see new options in your Control Panel as well, or your mouse icon might look different from the one you see in Figure 5.1. Computers that use a Microsoft Ballpoint mouse, for example, may have an icon that looks like a trackball rather than a tabletop mouse.
</P>
<p>Each icon in the Control Panel represents a little program (called an <i>applet</I>) that runs when you double-click it, typically bringing up one or more dialog boxes in which you can make settings. The following is a list of all the standard Control Panel applets and what they do.</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Accessibility Options</B>
<dd>Lets you set keyboard, mouse, sound, display, and other options that make a Windows 2000 computer easier to use by those who are visually, hearing, or motor impaired.
<dt><b>Add/Remove Hardware</B>
<dd>Runs the Hardware Wizard, which enables you to troubleshoot installed hardware, remove hardware, unplug a device, and of course add new hardware to the system.
<dt><b>Add/Remove Programs</B>
<dd>Adds or removes modules of Windows 2000 itself and sometimes adds or removes other kinds of programs.
<dt><b>Administrative Tools</B>
<dd>This is the same folder that was on the start menu in NT 4. Administrative Tools contains the tools you use to add user account to your computer, partition hard disks, etc.
<dt><b>CSNW</B>
<dd>Lets you configure Client Service for NetWare. This service is installed only if you have installed the NetWare Client Service under Networking, which is the topic of Chapter 25, &#147;Connecting to Novell NetWare Networks.&#148;
<dt><b>Date/Time</B>
<dd>Sets the current date and time, as well as identifies your time zone.
<dt><b>Display</B>
<dd>Sets the colors (or gray levels) and fonts of various parts of Windows 2000&#146;s screens, title bars, scroll bars, and so forth. Display also sets the background pattern or picture for the Desktop and enables you to choose the screen saver, display driver, screen resolution, and energy-saving mode (if your display supports it). If you have hardware support for multiple monitors, you can adjust their properties here as well.
<dt><b>Folder Options</B>
<dd>Allows you to determine the fundamental behavior of Windows 2000. It includes options for single-clicking to start programs, managing folder settings, and associating files. The tab for setting offline folder options is new to Windows 2000. It enables you to cache information from network folders for use when the network is not available.
<dt><b>Fonts</B>
<dd>Adds and deletes typefaces for your screen display and printer output. Enables you to look at samples of each of your fonts. Fonts are discussed at length in Chapter 9, &#147;Using WordPad for Simple Word Processing.&#148;
<dt><b>Game Controllers</B>
<dd>Lets you install, configure, and test a game controller such as a joystick or gamepad.
<dt><b>Internet Options</B>
<dd>Allows you to configure Internet auto-dial, use proxy servers, and make other advanced Internet-related settings.
<dt><b>Keyboard</B>
<dd>Sets the rate at which keys repeat when you hold them down, sets the cursor blink rate, determines the language your keyboard will be able to enter into documents, and lets you declare the type of keyboard you have.
<dt><b>Mail</B>
<dd>Defines and manages mail profiles. As explained in Chapter 13, &#147;Sending and Receiving E-Mail with Outlook Express,&#148; and Chapter 15, &#147;Using HyperTerminal,&#148; mail profiles are groups of settings that control how Outlook Express handles incoming and outgoing e-mail and faxes.
<dt><b>Monitoring Agent</B>
<dd>Allows you to configure the Network Monitor Agent, which is used to capture network traffic and relay it to another computer to be analyzed using Network Monitor.
<dt><b>Mouse</B>
<dd>Sets the speed of the mouse pointer&#146;s motion relative to your hand motion and sets how fast a double-click has to be to have an effect. You can also reverse the function of the right and left buttons, set the shape of the various Windows 2000 pointers, and tell Windows 2000 that you&#146;ve changed your type of mouse.
<dt><b>Network and Dial-Up Connections</B>
<dd>Function varies with the network type. This applet has changed since NT 4, but it still lets you make changes to your network configuration and also enables you to change Dial-Up Networking connections and other persistent network connections. This applet is covered in Chapter 30, &#147;Administrative and Diagnostic Tools.&#148;
<dt><b>Phone and Modems</B>
<dd>Lets you add, remove, and set the properties of the modem(s) connected to your system. This applet is covered in Chapter 15 and Chapter 16, &#147;Accessing the Internet.&#148;
<dt><b>Power Options</B>
<dd>Windows 2000 does support Advanced Power Management (APM), and this applet enables you to define how APM will be used by your computer. Using the Power Options applet, you can set the power conservation scheme and set options for how long your computer will sit idle before turning off the monitor, hard drives, or even entering suspend mode.
<dt><b>Printers</B>
<dd>Displays the printers you have installed on your system, lets you modify the property settings for those printers, and lets you display and manage the print queue for each of those printers. Use this applet to install printer drivers. Installing new printer drivers and managing the print queue are covered in Chapter 6, &#147;Printers and Printing,&#148; and Chapter 27, &#147;Supporting New Hardware and Installing Drivers.&#148;
<dt><b>Regional Options</B>
<dd>Sets the way that NT displays times, dates, numbers, and currency. This is covered in Chapter 31.
<dt><b>Scanners and Cameras</B>
<dd>Enables you to install, configure, and troubleshoot any installed digital cameras or scanners.
<dt><b>Scheduled Tasks</B>
<dd>This new applet lets you easily schedule programs to run automatically in Windows 2000.
<dt><b>Sounds and Multimedia</B>
<dd>Adds and configures sounds to specific system events if your computer has built-in sound capability or an installed sound card. Lets you set up sound <i>schemes</I>&#151;preset collections of sounds that your system uses to alert you to specific events. This is also the location for configuring or troubleshooting multimedia equipment on your computer.
<dt><b>System</B>
<dd>Displays information about your system&#146;s internals&#151;devices, amount of Random Access Memory (RAM), type of processor, environment settings, user profiles, hardware profiles, and start-up configuration. The use of the System applet is geared more toward advanced users. It is covered in detail in Chapter 31.
<dt><b>Users and Passwords</B>
<dd>Windows 2000 has moved away from using User Manager (as in NT 4) and has placed the local user and group management into this Control Panel applet. This is where you create and manage user and group accounts that are valid only on your Windows 2000 Professional computer.

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>All the Control Panel setting dialog boxes have a question mark (?) button in their upper-right corner. Remember from Chapter 3, &#147;Organizing Programs and Documents,&#148; that you can click this button and then click an item in the dialog box that you have a question about. You&#146;ll be shown a relevant explanation about the item.<hr></FONT>
