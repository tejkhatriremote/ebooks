<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading11"></A><font color="#000077">Removing Existing Programs</FONT></H4>
<p>With time, more programs will be made removable via the Control Panel. This is because the PC software industry at large has heard much &#147;kvetching&#148; from users and critics about tenacious programs that once installed are hard to remove. Some ambitious programs spread themselves all over your hard disk like olive oil in a hoagie, and there&#146;s no easy way of reversing the process and returning your system to a pristine state. The result is often overall system slowdown, unexplained crashes, or other untoward effects.
</P>
<p>To this end, aftermarket utilities such as UnInstaller&#153; from McAfee have become quite popular. Uninstall utility programs monitor and record exactly what files a new software package adds to your hard disk and which internal Windows 2000 settings it modifies. It can then undo the damage later, freeing up disk space and tidying your Windows 2000 system.</P>
<p>In typical fashion, Microsoft has incorporated such a scheme into Windows 2000. Time will tell if its mousetrap is as good as the competition&#146;s. Probably not, but it will be &#147;close enough for jazz,&#148; as the saying goes. If programmers write installation routines that work with Windows 2000&#146;s Add/Remove Programs applet, we&#146;ll all be in luck.</P>
<p>One of the nicest improvements in the Add/Remove Programs applet is the new interface for listing the applications that are installed. This new interface also tells you how large the application is on disk, when you last used the program, and even how frequently you use the program. This is really helpful when you&#146;re running out of drive space and trying to decide which program to delete to free up some space.</P>
<p>Use of the uninstall feature of the applet is simple:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first tab, select the program that you want to remove.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Change/Remove button.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer any warnings about removing an application as appropriate.
</DL>
<p>This procedure also enables you to add or remove components from some applications, which explains the name of the applet. If an application supports adding and removing components, you are asked if you want to remove all components, add or remove components, or reinstall the entire application.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>After the program is removed, you must reinstall the program from its source disks to make it work again. You can&#146;t just copy files out of the Recycle Bin folder to their old directories because settings from the Start button&#151;and possibly the Registry&#151;will have been deleted.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h3><a name="Heading12"></A><font color="#000077">Setting the Date and Time</FONT></H3>
<p>The Date/Time icon lets you adjust the system&#146;s date and time. The system date and time are used for a number of purposes, including date- and time-stamping the files you create and modify, and scheduling fax transmissions. All programs use these settings, regardless of whether they are Windows or non-Windows programs. (This applet doesn&#146;t change the format of the date and time&#151;just the actual date and time. To change the <i>format</I>, you use the Regional applet.) To set the date and time</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Double-click the Date/Time applet. The dialog box in Figure 5.11 appears.
<p><a name="Fig12"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch05/images/05-12.jpg',404,341)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch05/images/05-12t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch05/images/05-12.jpg',404,341)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 5.11</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjust the date, time, and local time zone from this dialog box. A shortcut to this box is to double-click the time in the Taskbar.</P>
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjust the date and time by typing the corrections or clicking the arrows. Note that you have to click directly on the hours, minutes, seconds, or <small>A.M.</SMALL>/<small>P.M.</SMALL> area before the little arrows to the right of them will modify the correct value.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, you can change the time zone you are in. Who cares about the time zone, you ask? Good question. For many users it doesn&#146;t matter. But because people fax to other time zones, and some programs help you manage your transcontinental and transoceanic phone calling, it&#146;s built into Windows 2000. These programs need to know where in the world you and Carmen Sandiego&#153; are. So, click the Time Zone tab and you&#146;ll see a world map (see Figure 5.12).
<p><a name="Fig13"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch05/images/05-13.jpg',404,341)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch05/images/05-13t.jpg"></A>

Some programs use this information to help you schedule mail or fax transmissions to other time zones. For laptop users who travel, this can be a great boon. Just point to your new location and click: The computer&#146;s time is automatically adjusted.</P>
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>You can also adjust the date and time using the <tt>date</TT> and <tt>time</TT> commands from the command prompt. Another method is to use the <tt>net time</TT> command to synchronize your system time and date with a specific server on your network.<hr></FONT>

<h3><a name="Heading13"></A><font color="#000077">Customizing Your Screen Display</FONT></H3>
<p>The Display applet packs a wallop under its hood. For starters, it incorporates what, in Windows 3.<i>x</I>, were the separate Color and Desktop Control Panel applets for prettying up the general look of the Windows screen. Then, in addition, the Display applet includes the means for changing your screen driver and resolution&#151;functions heretofore (in Windows 3.<i>x</I>) available only from the Setup program. If getting at all these areas for display-tweaking from different venues annoyed you, suffer no more. Microsoft has incorporated all display-related adjustments into the unified Display applet. If you are among the blessed, you even have the option of changing screen resolution on the fly.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The Display icon is accessible either from the Control Panel or from the Desktop. Right-click an empty area of the Desktop and choose Properties.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Here are the functional and cosmetic adjustments you can make to your Windows 2000 display from this applet:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the background and wallpaper for the Desktop.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the screen saver and energy conservation.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the color scheme and fonts for Windows elements.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the display device driver and adjust resolution, color depth, and font size.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjust the display properties of multiple monitors if the hardware provides this function.
</DL>
<p>Let&#146;s take a look at this dialog box page by page. This is a fun one to experiment with, and it comes in handy if you know how to use it. First run the applet by double-clicking it.
