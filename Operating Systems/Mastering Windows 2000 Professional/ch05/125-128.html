<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading15"></A><font color="#000077">Setting the Screen Saver</FONT></H4>
<p>A screen saver blanks your screen or displays a moving image or pattern if you don&#146;t use the mouse or keyboard for a predetermined amount of time. Screen savers can prevent a static image from burning the delicate phosphors on the inside surface of the monitor, which can leave a ghost of the image on the screen for all time regardless of what is displayed.
</P>
<p>Many modern computer monitors have an EPA Energy Star, Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA), or other kind of energy-saving strategy built into them. Because far too many people leave their computers on all the time (although it&#146;s not really true that they will last longer that way), efforts have been made by power regulators and electronics manufacturers to devise energy-conservation schemes for computers. If your monitor has an Energy Star rating and your video board supports this feature, the screen saver in NT can power the monitor down after it senses you went out to lunch or got caught up at the water cooler for a longer-than-expected break.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>For an energy-saving screen saver to work properly, you will need to set the power management options for you monitor by selecting Display <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch05/images/05-04i.jpg"> Screen Saver <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch05/images/05-05i.jpg"> Power. Also, the monitor must adhere to the VESA Display Power Management Signaling (DPMS) specification or to another method of lowering power consumption. Some LCD screens on portable computers can do this. You can assume that if your monitor has an Energy Star emblem, it probably supports DPMS. Energy Star is a program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reduce the amount of power used by personal computers and peripherals. The Energy Star emblem does not represent EPA endorsement of any product or service. If you notice that your screen freaks out or the display is garbled after your power-management screen saver turns on, you should turn off these settings.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The screen saver options enable you to choose or create an entertaining video ditty that will greet you when you return to work. You also can set how much time you have after your last keystroke or mouse skitter before the show begins.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Loading a Screen Saver</B></FONT></P>
<p>Here&#146;s how it&#146;s done:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Screen Saver tab. The page appears, as you see in Figure 5.15.
<p><a name="Fig17"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch05/images/05-17.jpg',404,448)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch05/images/05-17t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch05/images/05-17.jpg',404,448)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 5.15</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting up a screen saver</P>
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose a name from the drop-down list. The saver will be shown in the little screen in the dialog box.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Want to see how it will look on your whole screen? Click the Preview button. Your screen goes black and then begins its antics. The show continues until you hit any key or move your mouse.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to change anything about the selected screen saver, click Settings. You&#146;ll see a box of settings that apply to that particular screen saver. For example, for the 3D Text (OpenGL) screen saver, this is the settings box:
<p><a name="Fig18"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch05/images/05-18.jpg',360,168)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch05/images/05-18t.jpg"></A></P>
<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the option boxes have fun sliders and stuff you can play with to get an effect you like. Depending on the screen saver you chose, you may need to make a few adjustments, such as speed, placement, and details pertinent to the graphic. Play with the settings until you&#146;re happy with the results and OK the Settings box. By the way, try typing in Volcano to see what happens.
<dd><b>6.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Back at the Screen Saver tab, the next choice you might want to consider is Password Protected. If you set password protection on, every time your screen saver is activated you must type your password into a box to return to work. This is good if you don&#146;t want anyone else tampering with your files or seeing what you&#146;re doing. It can be a pain, though, if there&#146;s no particular need for privacy at your computer. To cancel the screen saver, you must press Ctrl&#43;Alt&#43;Del and enter the same password you use to log on to NT. If you cannot get back in, don&#146;t worry. An administrator can unlock the machine by entering their password. If they do this, it will log off your session, so the administrator can&#146;t see your work. Click the Password Protected check box if you want protection and proceed to the next two steps. Otherwise skip them.
<dd><b>7.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Back at the Desktop dialog box, set the number of minutes you want your computer to be idle before the screen saver springs into action. Next to Wait, either type a number or use the up and down arrows to change the time incrementally.
<dd><b>8.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the settings are correct, click Apply or OK.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Have you ever wondered about the difference between the OK and Apply buttons? They work like this: Apply makes the change but leaves the window or dialog open; OK makes the change and closes the window or dialog. You can use either one. You do not have to use Apply and then OK in order to save your changes.<hr></FONT>

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading16"></A><font color="#000077">Adjusting the Appearance</FONT></H4>
<p>The Appearance tab lets you change the way Windows 2000 assigns colors and fonts to various parts of the screen. If you&#146;re using a monochrome monitor (no color), altering the colors may still have some effect (the amount depends on how you installed Windows 2000).
</P>
<p>Windows 2000 sets itself up using a default color scheme that&#146;s fine for most screens&#151;and if you&#146;re happy with your colors as they are, you might not want to futz around with them.</P>
<p>However, the color settings options for Windows 2000 are flexible and easy to modify. You can modify the color setting of just about any part of a Windows 2000 screen. For those of you who are particular about color choices, you can do this manually, choosing colors from a palette or even mixing your own with the Custom Colors feature. Once created, custom colors and color setups can be saved on disk for later use or automatically loaded with each Windows 2000 session. For more expedient color reassignments, there are a number of supplied color scheme options.</P>
<p>After you click the Appearance tab, your dialog box looks like the one shown in Figure 5.16. The various parts of the Windows 2000 graphical environment that you can alter are shown in the top portion and named in the lower portion. As you select color schemes, these samples change so you can see what the effect will be without having to go back into Windows 2000 proper.</P>
