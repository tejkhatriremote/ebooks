<p>Windows 2000 has combined the best of both worlds by including two ways of handling hardware and software issues into one operating system. Because Windows 2000 is designed to work with different types of CPUs and their respective BIOS, Windows 2000 can&#146;t make the same assumptions that Windows 9<i>x</I> makes. The HAL (which bears no resemblance to the computer in <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</I>) acts as a buffer between most of the hardware and software, so there is no direct contact between the two without the HAL knowing about it. With the HAL in place, Windows 2000 can go about its business without worrying about what hardware has been installed, and what hasn&#146;t. Some of the communications between Windows 2000 and the hardware pass directly through the hardware device drivers. In these few cases, the HAL isn&#146;t involved, but the concept of hardware abstraction is still maintained. To add Plug-and-Play support in Windows 2000, Microsoft had to include the ability for the HAL to query the BIOS to discover what devices are installed. This means that the Plug-and-Play support is specific to each hardware platform running Windows 2000.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>When buying new peripherals, video cards, network cards, and the like, make sure that the item is bundled with Windows 2000 drivers. If the device drivers provided by the hardware manufacturer are designed to be compatible with Windows 2000, it means they&#146;re designed to talk to their hardware through the Executive Services and then report back to the operating system. This ensures that you&#146;ll never need to worry about compatibility problems. Also, it almost always means that you&#146;ll be able to configure the device&#146;s settings directly from the operating system (rather than needing to physically set switches on the new card or device). The fewer times you open your computer, the better!<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>With Windows 2000&#146;s hardware abstraction, there is a much smaller chance that you&#146;ll run into conflicts between different hardware devices. Now that Microsoft has added Plug-and-Play support to the hardware abstraction process this concern should be virtually eliminated.

</FONT></H4>
<p>Windows 2000 is built to run on the Intel <i>x</I>86 and IA64 families of computer processors. It can also run on computers running more than one processor. Windows 2000 Professional will support up to two processors. What&#146;s the advantage to all this? Well, it means you can use Windows 2000 on some very fast machines; you&#146;re not limited to the <i>x</I>86 series. On the other hand, Windows 9<i>x</I> can run only on an <i>x</I>86 processor and on only one of them at a time.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading8"></A><font color="#000077">Preemptive over Cooperative Multitasking</FONT></H4>
<p>Multitasking is the ability to do more than one thing at the same time. We all do it at work every day and usually with little thanks, but our computers have different ways of managing their own multitasking abilities. Multitasking comes in two flavors&#151;<i>cooperative</I> and <i>preemptive</I>.</P>
<p>Cooperative multitasking works like this:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>Program 1</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Excuse me, Program 2, may I use the portion of the CPU that you are using at present?
<dd><b>Program 2</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, certainly, Program 1. Let me finish this task and then it&#146;s all yours.
</DL>
<p>The preceding example shows cooperative multitasking working correctly, but what happens when it doesn&#146;t? For example, what if the second program doesn&#146;t give up its memory space when it&#146;s finished? Well, the program that is requesting the CPU time either waits (in which case you&#151;the innocent bystander&#151;watch the Windows hourglass spin on your screen) or, worse, your application crashes. With cooperative multitasking, you rely on the good intentions and the good behavior of whatever program happens to be running.
</P>
<p>Preemptive multitasking works like this:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>Program 1</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I want the CPU and I want it now!
<dd><b>Program 2</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;No, you can&#146;t have it. I&#146;m not finished yet. I might need it again.
<dd><b>Operating System</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, children. This is the way it&#146;s gonna be. You, Program 1, have to wait until Program 2 is finished. Then you can have the CPU for 37 milliseconds. When you&#146;re finished, I&#146;m giving it to another, more deserving program.
</DL>
<p>With preemptive multitasking, the operating system controls which program gets the CPU time. Its involvement in the process helps to minimize crashes and delays. You can even help, by telling the operating system which application should be given preference. We cover that in more detail later when we discuss using the Control Panel.
</P>
<p>Both Windows 9<i>x</I> and Windows 2000 use the same approach to multitasking&#151;that is, they use preemptive multitasking when running 32-bit programs and cooperative multitasking when running 16-bit Windows programs. Windows 9<i>x</I> uses a single memory space in which to run 16-bit Windows applications and separate memory spaces to run 32-bit programs. Because the 32-bit programs run in separate memory spaces, they can be preemptively multitasked, but because the 16-bit applications share the same space, they must cooperate for their turn in the CPU.</P>
<p>Windows 2000 operates in the same way, but goes a step further by enabling you to run the 16-bit applications in a separate memory space. When you do, you gain the ability to preemptively multitask the 16-bit programs. On both operating systems, MS-DOS programs are run in separate memory spaces and can be preemptively multitasked.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading9"></A><font color="#000077">Complete Protected Mode over Protected Mode with Real-Mode Support</FONT></H4>
<p>One of the selling points for Windows 95 was its emphasis on backward compatibility, which meant that it wasn&#146;t a <i>completely</I> 32-bit operating system. If you&#146;re running Windows 95 and you still have some old, real-mode, 16-bit drivers for your favorite peripheral, you can still use them with Windows 95. You can&#146;t use them with Windows 2000, though. That&#146;s because everything about Windows 2000 must be able to run in protected mode.</P>
<p>What are these modes, and what difference do they make? Simply put, <i>real-mode</I> drivers can talk directly to your PC hardware. Although this is a direct and efficient way for things to work, it also causes crashes and other errors that often beset computer users. <i>Protected-mode</I> drivers, on the other hand, cannot talk directly to computer hardware; they must go through the operating system. In Windows 2000, all protected-mode drivers must talk to the HAL to get to the hardware, which makes for a more secure operating environment.</P><p><br></P>
