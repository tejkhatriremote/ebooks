<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading10"></A><font color="#000077">Separate 16-Bit Memory Spaces over Shared 16-Bit Memory Spaces</FONT></H4>
<p>Despite all the advances brought about by 32-bit software, sooner or later you&#146;ll probably find yourself in a situation where you need to run 16-bit applications. Both Windows 2000 and Windows 9<i>x</I> run 16-bit programs just fine, but they run them differently, and this affects performance and system reliability.</P>
<p>In the world of Windows 9<i>x</I>, 16-bit Windows programs share the same memory space, or if you prefer, the same room. If one 16-bit Windows application goes down, it will also crash any other 16-bit applications you may be running. Windows 9<i>x</I> runs 32-bit programs much the same way that Windows 2000 does&#151;it runs them in separate memory spaces. Windows 9<i>x</I> also runs MS-DOS programs in separate memory spaces because the operating system first must create the illusion of a computer running MS-DOS. This simulation is called the Virtual DOS Machine (VDM).</P>
<p>Windows 2000 also uses a VDM to run MS-DOS applications, giving the appearance of a 486 computer with all the memory the program needs. Each VDM exists in its own memory space and runs as a 32-bit program. Windows 2000 uses the VDM to create the Win16 on Win32 (WOW) environment, too. The WOW is a simulation of Windows 3.1 on top of the simulation of MS-DOS. It runs just like Windows 3.1 with all the good points and the bad. By default, Windows 2000 shares the same WOW environment for all 16-bit Windows applications, which means that if one crashes, they all crash. But Windows 2000 differs from 9<i>x</I> in that you can start your 16-bit applications in separate memory spaces so they run just like 32-bit programs. That means you have the choice of using the default model of running the 16-bit applications in a shared memory space where they can crash each other, or running them in a separate 32-bit memory space where you can take advantage of preemptive multitasking and multiprocessing.</P>
<p>Running 16-bit programs in a separate memory may not always work. Some applications require a shared memory environment in order to exchange information or draw upon services provided by another program. Unfortunately, you may need to experiment some to find out if your 16-bit applications will run correctly on Windows 2000.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading11"></A><font color="#000077">NT File System over FAT File System</FONT></H4>
<p>DOS, Windows 3.<i>x</I>, and Windows 95 use the same type of file system, called FAT, for File Allocation Table. Here, when we mention a file system, we&#146;re not just talking about the order in which your files are stored on your hard drive. Rather, we&#146;re talking about the entire set of organizing principles that allow your operating system to communicate with your hard drive. The FAT approach to organizing this activity is to create a database (the FAT) at the boot sector of your hard drive. The boot sector is an area at the &#147;beginning&#148; of your hard drive. It&#146;s the place where the hard drive keeps the files that your operating system needs to talk to the drive, and the FAT is the most crucial of these.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The disk error messages you may have seen when running a disk utility under other operating systems are informing you of problems in the FAT!<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>NTFS or NT File System is a high-performance file system used by Windows NT and Windows 2000. It incorporates more powerful features than the FAT system. For example, not only can NTFS understand long filenames, up to 255 characters (actually, Windows 95 can also do this), NTFS also creates backup records of its Master File Table (MFT), which is the NTFS version of the FAT. If the boot sector of your hard drive (the place where file table information is stored) happens to be damaged through some unfortunate incident, the information can be replaced from one of the MFT backup records. As a result, it&#146;s much less likely that you&#146;ll lose data because of disk problems under NTFS than under FAT.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Windows 2000 has included the newer version of NTFS that was first released with Service Pack 4 on NT 4. If you want to multiboot Windows 2000 and NT 4, be sure to install the latest Service Pack.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Moreover, it is much more difficult for viruses to infect NTFS volumes than it is for them to infect FAT volumes. This is because the data on the NTFS volume is written differently than it is under FAT. Most viruses are looking for FAT file types and they don&#146;t know what to do when they encounter NTFS.
</P>
<p>NTFS also allows security controls for individual files, programs, or folders&#151;controllable by the Windows 2000 administrator or anyone with administrator privileges. FAT has no security features at all.</P>
<p>Neither DOS, nor Windows 3.<i>x</I>, nor Windows 95 understands NTFS. If you have two hard drives in your computer, and one of them is formatted as NTFS and the other as FAT, the above-mentioned operating systems will see only the FAT drive. Similarly, if you make multiple partitions of a single hard drive and format each of them with a different file system, the non-NT operating systems mentioned above won&#146;t see the NTFS-formatted partitions. Table 1.2 lists the main differences between NTFS and FAT.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Earlier versions of Windows NT supported the High Performance File System (HPFS) from OS/2. NT 4 and Windows 2000 do not support HPFS at all. If you have any partitions formatted with HPFS, you must convert them to NTFS before installing Windows 2000 or the data on those partitions will be inaccessible.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Windows 2000 does support the FAT32 file system, so multibooting with Windows 98 is now possible.<hr></FONT>
