<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading12"></A><font color="#000077">NT Security over Weak Security</FONT></H4>
<p>Windows 2000 is a completely secure environment. It has earned a C2 security rating from the United States government, a designation previously granted only to Unix and mainframe-based operating systems. C2 means that the system meets government specifications for secure computing.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Although Windows 2000 is built on NT 4 technology, which has been awarded C2 compliance and is expected to be C2 certified in its own right, it is not C2 compliant right out of the box. You will have some work to do to lock the system security down to make it compliant. The Windows 2000 Resource Kit includes the C2 Configuration utility (<tt>c2config.exe</TT>) to help you identify the weaknesses in your security model.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Unlike DOS or previous versions of Windows, every aspect of Windows 2000 is security-conscious. Security is controlled by the system administrator or anyone else with administrator privileges. NTFS allows you to assign specific security attributes (&#147;permissions&#148;) to individual files, programs, or folders, and to verify (&#147;authenticate&#148;) them when access to those protected items is attempted.
</P>
<p>To get a sense of the differences between Windows 95, Windows for Workgroups, and Windows 2000, try this: Go to any Windows 95 or Windows for Workgroups computer and turn it on. When Windows loads, it prompts you for a password. Assume for this experiment that you don&#146;t know the password. How might you go about using the computer anyway? Here&#146;s how most people do it: They hit the Esc key and watch the login screen magically disappear. They won&#146;t have access to everything that the password holder has, particularly to that user&#146;s networking connections, but they <i>can</I> get onto the computer and muck around.</P>
<p>Try the same experiment with Windows 2000, and you won&#146;t get so far. With Windows 2000, you <i>must</I> know the password in order to use or install any files or programs.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading13"></A><font color="#000077">How Is Windows 2000 Professional Different from Other Operating Systems?</FONT></H3>
<p>We&#146;ve discussed the differences and advantages of Windows 2000 Professional in comparison to Windows 95, but how does it stack up against other popular operating systems?
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading14"></A><font color="#000077">Windows 2000 Compared to Windows 3.<i>x</I>
</FONT></H4>
<p>Windows NT, Windows 3.1, and Windows for Workgroups (Windows 3.11) all once had the same interface and all were made by the same company, but that&#146;s where the similarities end. The Windows 3.<i>x</I> family of operating systems are 16-bit, completely real-mode operating systems and are also completely beholden to the DOS 640K memory model. Although Windows for Workgroups has built-in networking capabilities and can coexist quite nicely with Windows 2000 Professional on a network, it offers no security features of its own, relying instead on the network for things like password validation and rights authorization. Whereas Windows 2000 can run any program that the others can run, neither 3.1 nor 3.11 can take advantage of the 32-bit Windows programs that have become available in the wake of Windows 95.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading15"></A><font color="#000077">Windows 2000 Compared to OS/2</FONT></H4>
<p>Both Windows 2000 and OS/2 are 32-bit operating systems that also run 16-bit Windows applications and DOS applications in separate memory addresses. In terms of robustness, Windows 2000 and OS/2 are on about even footing. Past that, OS/2 gets left in the dust. OS/2 is not a secure environment and it lacks native networking capability&#151;you must buy additional software so OS/2 can talk to its network brethren. Furthermore, it won&#146;t run 32-bit Windows applications. Because only about three native OS/2 applications are available, this is a serious shortcoming.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading16"></A><font color="#000077">Windows 2000 Compared to Unix</FONT></H4>
<p>Of all the operating systems under discussion here, Unix is probably the most similar to Windows 2000 in terms of architecture. There are many different flavors of Unix, however. Each flavor of Unix has a different user interface, and not all of them are graphical. As a group, Unix operating systems are 32-bit, secure, and capable of running on Intel, RISC, and DEC Alpha processors.
</P>
<p>In the past, artists and designers have used high-end Unix-based workstations to create special effects for films. Windows 2000, however, supports high-end 3-D protocols such as Open GL and Raydream. Running Windows 2000 on a high-powered <i>x</I>86 processor such as the Pentium Pro or Pentium II or III will give you equal processing power to those Unix workstations, with the added punch of Windows 2000, for a fraction of the price.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading17"></A><font color="#000077">Windows 2000 Compared to Macintosh OS</FONT></H4>
<p>Like Windows 2000, the Macintosh operating system (OS) is a 32-bit environment with built-in networking capabilities. Despite its well-known and intuitive interface, the Macintosh OS lacks many of the powerful features found in Windows NT. Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), MAPI, and TAPI are all unfamiliar to Apple users. The Mac OS supports only a limited sort of cooperative multitasking, and you can switch between programs only with the mouse; there&#146;s no equivalent to the mighty Alt&#43;Tab key combination in Windows. There is also a relatively limited amount of software available to the Macintosh market as compared to the Windows market.
</P>
<h3><a name="Heading18"></A><font color="#000077">What Are the Features of Windows 2000 Architecture?</FONT></H3>
<p>We&#146;ve already discussed some of Windows 2000&#146;s architecture. In this section, we analyze it a little more closely to see what makes Windows 2000 tick and why it is different from other operating systems. We go into Windows 2000&#146;s architecture in much greater detail later in the book (starting in Part IV), but this will serve as a primer for those of you who can&#146;t wait.
</P>
<p>From a programmer&#146;s perspective, Windows 2000 is divided into two layers. These are actually two separate operating modes. The <i>Kernel mode</I> is where Windows 2000 performs its internal tasks and controls interaction between programs and the operating system, and between programs themselves. It is generally protected from end users fiddling with it. The <i>User mode</I>, which is usually pictured as though it sits above the Kernel mode because it is closer to the end user, is where your applications run. The area is considered non-protected, because you have access to it through your applications. These two modes are depicted in Figure 1.1.</P>

This figure shows the components of each mode/layer in Windows 2000.<p><br></P>
