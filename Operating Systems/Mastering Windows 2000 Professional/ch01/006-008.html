<p><br></P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>TAPI Support</B></FONT></P>
<p>Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) is an operating system component that offers modem access to any application that calls on it. After Windows 2000 locates and installs your modem, you never need to worry about configuring it again for the applications you use.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>MAPI Support</B></FONT></P>
<p>Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) is a layer of software that enables you to send e-mail from any MAPI-aware program.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Outlook Express</B></FONT></P>
<p>Outlook Express is a useful client for sending and receiving e-mail and faxes. You can use it to access LAN-based e-mail, to connect to the Internet, or to connect to online services.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Fax Services</B></FONT></P>
<p>Windows 2000 has included a fax service, which sends and receives faxes through a separate Fax Queue (just like a printer), or through various fax-aware applications like your favorite e-mail client software.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Microsoft Internet Explorer</B></FONT></P>
<p>Internet Explorer (IE) is Microsoft&#146;s all-purpose Web browser. Much as in Windows 98, Windows 2000 has integrated IE into the desktop environment. IE functions are integrated into the entire operating system to make it easier to reach documents either on your local network or anywhere on the Internet.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Internet Information Services</B></FONT></P>
<p>Windows 2000 Professional includes the same Internet Information Services (IIS) as its big brother, Windows 2000 Server. IIS provides the ability to act as a Web server, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) server for e-mail.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>DirectX Multimedia Support</B></FONT></P>
<p>DirectX is Microsoft&#146;s architecture for accelerating the multimedia components of Windows 2000 and Windows 98. Windows 2000 supports the entire suite of DirectX 7&#146;s components. DirectX 7 is comprised of the following components:
</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>DirectDraw</B>
<dd>Controls the graphics and video functions on your computer (the way that images are drawn on your screen).
<dt><b>DirectSound</B>
<dd>Controls the way that sound is played on your computer.
<dt><b>DirectInput</B>
<dd>Controls joystick commands on your computer.
<dt><b>Direct3D</B>
<dd>Controls the manipulation of 3-D images on your screen.
<dt><b>DirectPlay</B>
<dd>Provides network access for programs written to take advantage of DirectX 7.
</DL>

<p><font size="+1"><b>WordPad</B></FONT></P>
<p>Like a big brother to Notepad, WordPad is a Rich Text Format (RTF) text editor, which means that in addition to just typing text into it, you can format your text and dress it up as you might with a more fully featured word processor.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Hardware Profiles</B></FONT></P>
<p>If you use your computer and peripherals in various configurations, you can use the Hardware Profiles feature to create different hardware scenarios for different environments. When the computer starts, you simply pick which profile you want to use and away you go.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Kernel-Based Graphics</B></FONT></P>
<p>Just as in NT 4, graphics functions in Windows 2000 have been moved into the Kernel, which is Windows 2000&#146;s core software. This means significant performance increases for graphics software.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Services</B></FONT></P>
<p>Not everything that happens in Windows 2000 is noticeable even to the most expert users. Windows 2000 uses a whole set of commands, called <i>services</I>, that run completely in the background. Services take care of network operations, multithreaded processes, and other things that you don&#146;t want to worry about. With Windows 2000, certain software can be installed as services in order to let them run constantly, in the background, without you ever needing to think about them. Network drivers are a common example of this type of software.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>PCMCIA Support</B></FONT></P>
<p>Especially helpful for mobile users, Windows 2000 provides drivers for Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) cards. What&#146;s new in Windows 2000, however, is the support for the 32-bit CardBus interface for PCMCIA devices.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>NDS Client Support</B></FONT></P>
<p>This feature enables Windows 2000 users to log on to NetWare networks that use NetWare Directory Services (NDS). Further, it allows them to continue to use all of Windows 2000&#146;s extensive networking features within that context.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Java Support</B></FONT></P>
<p>Java is the exciting Internet programming language from Sun Microsystems that lets you run small applications&#151;applets&#151;over the Internet. The most innovative aspect of Java is its platform independence. That is, a Java applet doesn&#146;t care if you are running a PC, a Unix server, or a Macintosh. Java applets use the Internet and Web browsers as their platform. Microsoft introduced Java support with IE 3. IE 5 is integrated into Windows 2000.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>ActiveX Support</B></FONT></P>
<p>ActiveX is Microsoft&#146;s programming specification for incorporating multimedia and interactive content into Internet documents such as Web pages. Like Java, ActiveX will eventually be platform independent. ActiveX was introduced with IE 3 and extended in IE 4. Remember that IE 5 of is included with Windows 2000.
