<h3><a name="Heading11"></A><font color="#000077">Web Cruising with MS Internet Explorer</FONT></H3>
<p>Probably the first thing you&#146;ll want to try after connecting to the Internet is cruising the Web by using your Web browser. Certainly, you can use Netscape&#146;s Navigator browser, but because Windows 2000 comes with Microsoft&#146;s Internet Explorer 5 (MSIE), that&#146;s the one we&#146;ll assume you&#146;re using for this little test cruise.
</P>
<p>To open Internet Explorer, double-click its icon, which you more than likely can find already installed on your Desktop. You can also see its icon on the Launch Bar, which is located just to the right of the Start button. When Internet Explorer opens, it may go to a default page or it may try to open a local page that doesn&#146;t exist. In any case, type a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), such as <tt>microsoft.com</TT> or <tt>Webcrawler.com</TT>, into the URL/Address area and press Enter. If you&#146;re connected, within seconds the page should begin loading.</P>
<p>As you jump from page to page, all previous pages you&#146;ve visited are saved in a temporary cache, so returning to them next time is much quicker (unless the cache has been cleared in the meantime). Note that you can jump ahead and back by clicking the back and forward buttons on Internet Explorer&#146;s toolbar. You can accomplish the same thing on the keyboard, using the Backspace key to go back a page and Shift+Backspace to go forward. Pressing the PgUp and PgDn keys scrolls up or down a screen at a time, and the up and down arrows scroll up or down by a much smaller amount. If the type is too small (or too large), click the A icon on the toolbar to cycle through the font sizes. To print whatever page(s) you&#146;re looking at, click the Printer button on the toolbar, or select File <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch16/images/16-10i.jpg"> Print. Note that font sizes when printing are affected by the current font size in the browser, so sometimes you may want to scale the font size down a bit prior to printing.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>When you are viewing Web pages that are designed with frames, pressing the Printer button may give you a hard copy of the wrong frame. If this happens, right-click in the frame that you want printed, and select Print from the context menu.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Then, of course, there&#146;s the Favorites button on the toolbar (and the Favorites menu), which you use to &#147;bookmark&#148; those places you want to return to easily later. If you&#146;re a typical Web user, you&#146;ll likely fill up your Favorites folder with favorite pages; at some point you&#146;ll have to create subfolders for sorting the bookmarks into categories to make them manageable. Note that you can place these bookmarks anywhere&#151;on your Desktop, in another folder, or even within an e-mail message (if you&#146;re using Microsoft Outlook Express to send your e-mail, which is covered in Chapter 13, &#147;Sending and Receiving E-Mail with Outlook Express&#148;).
</P>
<p>Another nice thing you can do in Internet Explorer is right-click any image in a Web page, which brings up a pop-up menu that includes options to make this image the current wallpaper or to save the image in a handy format for later wallpapering or viewing. You can also right-click any background wallpaper in the browser and set this as your Desktop wallpaper or save it to a file for later use.</P>
<p>The Internet Options dialog box (accessible via the Tools <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch16/images/16-11i.jpg"> Internet Options menu) lets you tweak various settings, such as whether to play sounds, show video clips (or ignore them), and change the background color and default fonts. You can change the default home page, which the browser goes to when it&#146;s first opened. On the Advanced tab, you can clear the page cache, enable use of secure protocols, enable Java Just In Time compiling, and configure the ratings system to prevent child (or adult!) access to various categories of off-color or objectionable content.</P>
<p>The Internet Option dialog box is also where you would go to set the address of your proxy server. If you are using Internet Explorer inside of a company with a firewall, a proxy server may be the only way to reach the Internet. A proxy translates the Web requests from computers inside the company to one &#147;real&#148; address on the Internet; it then passes the requests through on behalf of the client computer. If you don&#146;t know the address or configuration of your company&#146;s proxy, contact your network administrator.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading12"></A><font color="#000077">Using Built-In Internet Utilities</FONT></H3>
<p>Windows 2000 Professional includes several standard Internet utilities. These programs are in most cases functionally identical to the same programs or commands found on pretty much every flavor of Unix. Although most people are not going to use these nearly as often as they will their Web browsers, we describe each in the following sections so you at least know what they are. It is useful to acquaint yourself, for example, with FTP&#151;if you are ever on a Windows 2000 system that for some reason does not have a Web browser, knowing how to use FTP to transfer files enables you to connect to Spry, Netscape, or Microsoft and download a browser.
</P>
<p>Following this brief rundown of each of the tools, we will look at other Internet applications you can download via the Internet. Note that with each of the following programs, you can get help by typing the program name at the command prompt followed by <b>-?</B> (dash, question mark).</P><p><br></P>
