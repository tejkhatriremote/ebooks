<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">Using Internet Addresses</FONT></H4>
<p>Every computer on the Internet has a unique identity in the form of a 32-bit (4-byte) number, which for readability&#146;s sake is usually shown as a four-part numeric address. Some folks refer to this number as <i>dot notation</I> or a <i>quad address</I>. For example, a typical address (Microsoft&#146;s) looks like this:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
   198.105.232.30
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>In most cases, the address also exists as a name, with a <i>domain</I> that shows either the type of business or other institution that uses this address (such as <tt>com</TT> for commercial, <tt>edu</TT> for educational, or <tt>gov</TT> for government), or the country in which it&#146;s located. For example, Microsoft&#146;s domain address is <tt>microsoft.com</TT>, whereas the Pacific Space Centre, a planetarium and observatory in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, uses <tt>pacific-space-centre.bc.ca</TT> as its address. Your Internet access provider uses a database server called a Domain Name System (DNS) server to convert from domain names to numeric addresses.</P>
<p>Regardless of the access method you choose, you need to obtain an account from your network administrator or service provider. In the same way that every computer connected to the Internet has its own address, every user has a distinctive account name. Therefore, if a business employs Frances Smith and Fred Smith in the same department, only one could have the account name <tt>fsmith</TT>. When you combine the username with the domain name, the two are separated by an <i>at</I> sign (@) so you can identify (and send mail to) anybody with an account on any Internet system in the format <tt><i>name@address.domain</I></TT>. So, for example, some typical Internet account names would be</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
   bluebottle@finchly.uk
   yokum@dogpatch.com
   snorkel@swampy.mil
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>In addition to your account name, address, and password, your service provider or network administrator may also give you several other pieces of information that you need to set up your Internet account. These may include the dial-in Internet host&#146;s telephone number and the numeric addresses of the servers for name conversion, mail, and network news.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>In the not-too-distant future, we will have a new version of TCP/IP addressing. The new version, referred to as IPv6, or TCP/IP version 6, will boast completely different addressing than our current IPv4. The new addresses will have eight groups of four <i>hexadecimal</I> numbers. Hexadecimal is a base 16 number system, where the possible values range from 0 to F. A possible IPv6 address could look like this: <tt>FEDC:BA98:1234:5678:0BCA:9987:0102:1235</TT>.<hr></FONT>

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading4"></A><font color="#000077">Connecting as a Remote Terminal</FONT></H4>
<p>When you use a communications program such as HyperTerminal to dial into a host computer, your PC becomes a terminal on that host. If the host is connected to the Internet, you must use Internet programs resident on the host.
</P>
<p>The most common remote-terminal access to the Internet is through a Unix host or a host that recognizes Unix-like Internet commands such as Telnet, FTP, and so forth.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Unix is a widely used computer operating system that is available for many kinds of computers, including desktop systems, mainframes, and everything in between. Unix enables more than one program to run at a time and multiple users to share a single computer.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>As far as Windows 2000 is concerned, when you use a shell account, your PC is running a modem communications program to move ASCII characters or binary files through a modem. All the TCP/IP activity is happening at the host. In other words, when you type commands on your PC&#146;s keyboard, those commands pass through your computer to the host, which runs the programs that communicate with the Internet.
</P>
<p>If you have a remote-terminal connection to the Internet, you don&#146;t need to worry about network configuration because the administrator of the host computer has taken care of all those things for you. After you know your account name, password, and the host&#146;s Internet address (name), you&#146;re ready to go.</P>
<p>As mentioned earlier, we assume in this chapter that you will want to connect via LAN or modem to the Internet. Connecting via LAN simply requires that you have your networking hardware installed and connected to the network, and that you have the necessary Windows 2000 software installed to get on the network. To put it simply, once you&#146;re on the network, you&#146;re also on the Internet!</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>In most businesses, network administrators or other technical staff are responsible for connecting individual workstations to the LAN and may actively discourage you from trying to handle this. But if no such person is available, and you need help with installing and configuring the LAN adapter or software and connecting to the network, please see Chapter 27, &#147;Supporting New Hardware and Installing Drivers.&#148; You may also want to read the sections in this chapter on installing Peer Web Services and using Internet Explorer and the other Internet tools included with Windows 2000.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h3><a name="Heading5"></A><font color="#000077">Connecting via Modem</FONT></H3>
<p>To connect to the Internet by modem, if you haven&#146;t already, you need to select an ISP in your area and sign up for a dial-in account. After your account is set up, you need to do the following:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the connection information (phone number, user ID, password, and TCP/IP settings) from your ISP. They will mail this to you, but you may want to ask for it over the phone to get started sooner.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Install Windows 2000&#146;s modem support for your modem (and the modem itself, if necessary!).
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Configure your Dial-Up Networking connection.
</DL>
<p>That&#146;s it&#151;simple, eh? In case you don&#146;t think it&#146;s so simple, we&#146;ve broken down each step into the following procedures, and you shouldn&#146;t have any trouble if you follow the steps carefully. Remember that you&#146;ll only have to do them once (assuming all goes well). After that, connecting each time to the Internet will be a piece of cake. You can even have your modem dial silently and automatically whenever you start up any Internet application (such as your Web browser).
