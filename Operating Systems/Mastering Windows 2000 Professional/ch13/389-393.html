<p><big><big>T</BIG></BIG>he Outlook Express client is the heart of Windows 2000&#146;s messaging ability. In NT 4 you had Windows Messaging as the e-mail client. Windows Messaging could easily send and receive mail from several different messaging providers, with add-on capabilities available from other software vendors. Outlook Express is a bit different in that respect. It only deals with Internet e-mail: mail using the Post Office Protocol (POP) to receive and the Simple Message Transport Protocol (SMTP) to send. Of course that isn&#146;t the whole story. Outlook Express in Windows 2000 can also use Internet Message Access Protocol version 4 (IMAP4) and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to send and receive messages.</P>
<p>This really isn&#146;t as limiting as it might seem. Nearly every mail server on the market today can support POP and SMTP mail services, so Outlook Express can work with your e-mail server just fine.</P>
<p>The Outlook Express client is a return to the philosophy of a focused client that just does one thing: It works with messaging. Instead of having an application like Outlook or the Exchange client, which can do messaging, scheduling, contacts, track notes, and keep a journal of your activities, Outlook Express sends and receives mail and enables you to read Newsgroups on the Internet. Just the messages, ma&#146;am.</P>
<p>In addition to the client services provided by Outlook Express, you can opt to run another mail client like Exchange or Outlook from Microsoft, or perhaps Lotus Notes, Qualcomm&#146;s Eudora, or any of the other mail clients available today. Outlook Express will work seamlessly with Exchange Server if the server is configured to use SMTP or IMAP.</P>
<p>Outlook Express is just the most visible part of the messaging support in Windows 2000. The other parts that are not quite as visible include the following:</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>The Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)</B>
<dd>MAPI is the interface between Outlook Express, or any other messaging client, and the drivers that communicate with different message systems. MAPI defines certain standard ways to send and receive messages. Outlook Express does not support MAPI, but the support is there for other clients that do.
<dt><b>Personal Address Book</B>
<dd>Your Address Book is part of your individual messaging profile. It contains names and e-mail addresses, phone numbers, NetMeeting addresses, DigitalIDs, and more. You can easily track a lot of information about any person you know, whether it&#146;s business-related or personal.
<dt><b>Microsoft Fax</B>
<dd>Microsoft Fax is a MAPI client that integrates the ability to send and receive faxes on your computer with other MAPI messaging clients. This lets you receive a fax and automatically forward it to an Exchange mailbox, for instance.
</DL>

<p>Windows 2000&#146;s messaging architecture is similar to the telephony architecture described in Chapter 12, &#147;Introduction to Communications and Using Phone Dialer.&#148; The architecture uses an application programming interface (API) between the front-end programs the user sees and the drivers for various messaging services. Figure 13.1 illustrates the software flow.

<p>This modular structure enables outside software developers to create new drivers to work with existing applications or new front-end applications to work with existing drivers. As a user, you can install new features and services without the need to completely relearn the messaging system.
</P>
<p>There is no need to install Outlook Express separately when you install Windows 2000 on your computer; it&#146;s always installed by default. It can be started either by clicking its icon in the Launch Bar (just to the right of the Start button) or by going to Start <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch13/images/13-01i.jpg"> Programs <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch13/images/13-02i.jpg"> Outlook Express.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Working with User Identities</FONT></H3>
<p>Outlook Express keeps track of user profiles so that different users can use the same computer to send and receive e-mail. This is in addition to the native ability of Windows 2000 to create and maintain user profiles for each user that logs onto the computer. The user profiles, or <i>Identities</I> as they are called in Outlook Express, enable multiple users to send and receive mail from the same user session of Windows 2000. This could be useful if the Windows 2000 computer is located someplace where many people will use it without having separate user accounts.</P>
<p>When you open Outlook Express for the first time, if you haven&#146;t connected to the Internet, the Internet Connection Wizard is run. This wizard includes the option to create and configure an Internet mail account. If you have already connected to the Internet, but you did not create a mail account, when you open Outlook Express it will automatically run the portion of the Internet Connection Wizard that you skipped before, as shown in Figure 13.2.</P>

<p>Once you have configured Outlook Express to work with one identity, you may choose to create more. Figure 13.3 shows the New Identity dialog box. You will need to type in a name to describe this identity in the Type Your Name text box. Then decide whether you want to apply a password to this identity. A password won&#146;t prevent people from getting to your messages on the hard disk, but it will keep them from logging onto your e-mail through Outlook Express.

<p>When you are satisfied with the settings to create the identity, click OK. Now you will need to switch to the new identity. To switch identities in Outlook Express, select File <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch13/images/13-03i.jpg"> Identities <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch13/images/13-04i.jpg"> Switch Identities, or if you have Outlook Express highlighted in the left pane of the main window, you can click Identities in the right pane then select Switch Identities from the drop-down menu. Outlook Express will close its window, switch to the new identity, and then re-open the window. If this is the first time you&#146;ve used the identity, you will be prompted to configure the mail account using the Internet Connection Wizard.</P><p><br></P>
