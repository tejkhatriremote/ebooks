<p>If your print job isn&#146;t coming out quite like you expected (or at all), make sure that you&#146;ve got the printer set up correctly. Have you specified an existing printer port? What about the printer driver&#151;did you install the right one for your printer? If so, you may want to try deleting and reinstalling the printer driver. (Remove the printer from the system and re-create it.)
</P>
<p>The problem could also be in the application. Can you print to another printer? Can you print to that printer from another application? If it&#146;s a DOS application, try copying the driver file to the application&#146;s directory and then try to print again.</P>
<p>It&#146;s also possible that something could go wrong with the printer itself, or the cabling, especially if you can&#146;t print from DOS. After you&#146;ve checked the printer to make sure that it&#146;s online, plugged in, and has paper, check the connection. Will the printer work when attached to another parallel or serial port? If so, you could have a network problem. Try printing the file directly from the print server. If nothing else works, try removing extraneous cards from the print server to see if it&#146;s a hardware conflict. Windows 2000&#146;s capability to network printers is one of its great strengths. With a firm grasp of the Print Manager, you can make sure that all users have easy access to printing services.</P>
<p>If you&#146;re printing through a <i>serial</I> port, you&#146;ll see a Printer Out of Paper message when any one of the following things is wrong:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The printing device is out of paper.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The printing device is offline.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The printing device is switched off.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The cable to the printing device is disconnected.
</DL>
<p>You get the message because serial connections don&#146;t have the status lines available to communicate exactly what the problem is. When something has gone wrong, you know only that there&#146;s a problem, not what the problem is. The default message is that the printer is out of paper, but you need to check all the other options if you&#146;re using a serial connection.
</P>
<p>Always remember to check the simple things first. There are two questions that should always be asked (gently and carefully) when your print job will not come out on the printer. The first is, &#147;Is it plugged in?&#148; Check the cable from the computer to the printer <i>and</I> the power cord. The second question is, &#147;Is it turned on?&#148; Some printers have their power switch in hard-to-find locations. Asking yourself these questions can often fix the problem. You&#146;d be amazed how often this solves printing issues. If your document won&#146;t print from your favorite application, can you print from Notepad? Notepad is the simplest printing that you can get in Windows 2000. If you can print from Notepad, but not from your application, then your application is to blame. For more information on troubleshooting printing, please refer to Chapter 32, &#147;Advanced Troubleshooting Methodology.&#148;</P>
<h3><a name="Heading32"></A><font color="#000077">Summary</FONT></H3>
<p>Printing is an everyday task we often take for granted. Windows 2000 Professional makes this task easy once you have learned some of the techniques covered in this chapter.
</P>
<p>Windows 2000 provides an easy-to-use wizard to add printers to your computer and to share them for use on the network. It also provides the printer drivers to other users automatically. After a printer has been shared for network use, a person with the correct permissions can adjust the queue, manage documents, and even manage the printer itself.</P><p><br></P>
