<p><big><big>W</BIG></BIG>ith the advent of computers came the notion of the &#147;paperless office.&#148; In fact, the goal of the paperless office was heralded as practically the eighth wonder of the world, and computers were to be the key to this promised miracle. My, how times change.</P>
<p>Doing without paper is a wild fantasy in most businesses today. Working completely without a printer to produce most of that paper is totally unthinkable. Go into any office and you&#146;ll hear printers churning out reports, receipts, payroll checks, and even the boss&#146;s daughter&#146;s eighth-grade term paper. No, the paperless office is a miracle that is far too good to be true. The speed of the printer, color of the page, and clarity of the graphics are products much more important these days than a lack of file drawers.</P>
<p>As necessary as they are, however, printers are still big and expensive and printers aren&#146;t used every minute that a computer is used. Sharing a printer between two or even twenty workstations can be a practical solution to money and space constraints. Windows 2000 Professional provides easy, efficient, and helpful tools for sharing a printer among workstations.</P>
<p>At times, however, not sharing a printer is important as well. For example, when the weekly newsletter is printed, all other printing tasks must take a back seat. Windows 2000 comes with security measures that can be easily arranged to give one person or group of people particular access rights and to give people access at different times of the day. If your printer seems overused, the auditing feature can provide detailed accounts of who used the printer when, so that resources can be allocated more efficiently.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Printing in Windows 2000 Professional</FONT></H3>
<p>The first thing to get out of the way is some basic Windows 2000 terminology. In the language of Windows 2000 printing, a <i>printer</I> is the software that controls a <i>print device</I>, which is the hardware. This can be confusing, but knowing this terminology can be valuable when trying to describe printing issues. The printer is the combination of the printer driver, support files, and the print queue. The print device is the part that we can&#146;t seem to live without and that costs all the money.</P>
<p>As in previous versions of Windows NT, when you choose to print something in Windows 2000, unless you indicate otherwise, Windows programs hand off data to the operating system, which in turn <i>spools</I> the data to a specified printer. Spooling means temporarily putting information that&#146;s headed for the printer on the hard disk. Your document is then sent to the printer at the slow speed that the printer can handle. This lets you get back to work with your program(s) sooner. You can even print additional documents, stacking up a load of jobs for the printer to print. This stack is called a <i>queue</I>.</P>
<p>In Windows NT 3.<i>x</I> (and Windows 3<i>.x</I>), a program called Print Manager was responsible for spooling and managing the print jobs. Windows NT Workstation 4 nomenclature dispensed with the term <i>Print Manager</I>, even though the same functionality is provided. Now you simply look at what&#146;s &#147;inside&#148; a printer by clicking the printer&#146;s icon. This opens a window and displays the print queue for that printer. In reality, however, there <i>is</I> a spooler program and a Print Manager-like utility in Windows 2000, and in this chapter, that is how we&#146;ll refer to the window that enables you to see and work with information about the print queue.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Print jobs from MS-DOS programs can also be spooled, so you can get back to work with your DOS or Windows programs while printing happens in the background.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>When you print from a Windows program, Print Manager receives the data, queues up the jobs, routes them to the correct printer, and, when necessary, issues error or other appropriate messages to print-job originators. As in earlier versions of Windows NT, you can use the Print Manager user interface to manage your print jobs. Print Manager makes it easy to check on what&#146;s printing and see where your job(s) are in the print queue relative to other people&#146;s print jobs. You may also be permitted to rearrange the print queue, delete print jobs, or pause and resume a print job so you can reload or otherwise service the printer.
</P>
<p>In Windows 3.<i>x</I>, printer-driver installation and configuration (making connections) are done through the Printers applet in Control Panel, and print-job management is done through the Print Manager program. Windows 2000 Professional (like Windows 9<i>x</I>) combines both functions in the Printers folder. (The Control Panel still has a Printers icon, but it simply opens the Printers folder.) Each printer you&#146;ve installed appears in the Printers folder, along with an additional icon called Add Printer that lets you set up new printers. Printer icons in the folder appear and behave like any other objects. You can delete them at will, create new ones, and set their properties. Double-clicking a printer in the folder displays its print queue and lets you manipulate the queue. Commands on the menus let you install, configure, connect, disconnect, and remove printers and drivers.</P><p><br></P>
