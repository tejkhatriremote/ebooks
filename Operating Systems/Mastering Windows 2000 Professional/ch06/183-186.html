<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading17"></A><font color="#000077">Setting User Permissions to the Printer</FONT></H4>
<p>Just because you share a printer doesn&#146;t necessarily mean that you want everyone on its domain to be able to access it. Maybe it&#146;s the color printer with the expensive ink that only the graphics people need to use, or you want to reduce the risk of security breaches by limiting the people who can print copies of company secrets. Either way, you&#146;ll want to control access to the printer just as you would to any other network device.
</P>
<p>By default, only administrators have full access to the printer. Only those with Manage Printers permission can pause or resume a printer or change its permissions. Those who have only print access can administer only their own documents.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The default print permissions in Windows 2000 Professional are as follows: Administrators and Power Users have Manage Printers permission; the Everyone group has Print permission; Creator Owner (the person who submits a job) has Manage Documents permission for the job they have submitted.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Users on a workstation are automatically given the right to use the printer connected to the workstation. They are, therefore, automatically given the ability to connect to another printer on the domain for which they also have user permissions. These default limitations and permissions can be modified by the administrator. Just as you can control devices on a network, you are able to control printer use by setting the permissions on it.
</P>
<p>In the Printer Properties dialog box, click the Security tab to see the dialog box shown in Figure 6.12.</P>
<p><a name="Fig21"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-21.jpg',404,448)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-21t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-21.jpg',404,448)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 6.12</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Security tab of the Printer Properties dialog box</P>
<p>The Security tab lists the accounts that have set up some kind of printer access. From here, you can change the level of access that each user group has. Printing permissions are granted to groups, not individual users. Therefore, granting user permission means making a user a member of a group with the printing permission you want that user to have.
</P>
<p>The default permission levels are as follows:</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Print</B>
<dd>Members of that user group can print documents and manage their own documents.
<dt><b>Manage Documents</B>
<dd>Members can control document settings and pause, resume, restart, and delete documents lined up for printing, including documents submitted by others.
<dt><b>Manage Printers</B>
<dd>Members can do anything with the printer&#151;print; control document settings; pause, resume, and delete documents and printers; change the printing order of documents; and change printer properties and permissions.
</DL>

<p>To change someone&#146;s level of permission for the printer, simply check the box beside the type of permission you want to grant. In NT 4 you could assign the No Access permission to a user or group if you <i>really</I> wanted to keep them out of your printer. Windows 2000 doesn&#146;t have a separate No Access permission anymore. To get the equivalent level of permission, that is to keep the user out of your printer completely, simply add them to the list of groups and users but uncheck <i>all</I> of the boxes. If you do not grant permission it&#146;s the same thing as saying No Access.</P>
<p>To add a user group or user to the printer permissions list, click the Add button. You&#146;ll see a screen that looks like Figure 6.13.</P>
<p><a name="Fig22"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-22.jpg',561,434)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-22t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-22.jpg',561,434)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 6.13</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Users, Computers, or Groups dialog box</P>
<p>To add a group or individual user to the permission list, press the Add button on the Security tab of the Printer Properties sheet. Windows 2000 Professional can display all of the accounts you have access to for permissions. This will include user and group accounts from the local computer as well as any group or user account in the Directory. The default behavior is to display only the accounts in the context you&#146;ve logged onto. For instance, if you&#146;ve logged onto the domain, the list will display all of the accounts for the domain. If you logon to the local computer instead, then you will see the accounts on your local computer. You can still drop down the Look In list box to see the other accounts.
</P>
<p>To remove a group or user from the printer permissions list, on the Security tab, highlight the name of the user or group, and then click Remove.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If a user is a member of more than one group with different printer permissions, the system grants the highest-level permission. So, if Jane is a member of one group with Print permission and a member of another group with Full Control permission, she&#146;ll always have Full Control permission. The only time that print permissions are <i>not</I> cumulative is when one of the groups that a user belongs to has No Access to the printer. In that case, that permission level overrides all higher levels and the user has no access to the printer, regardless of a user&#146;s access level or membership in other user groups.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading18"></A><font color="#000077">Getting Ownership Information</FONT></H4>
<p>The user with administrative privileges who created the printer is considered the owner of it, just as files are owned by their creators.
</P>
<p>Taking ownership of a printer, like taking ownership of a file, can be done only by an administrator or someone with Manage Printers permission, and that event can be traced through the Auditing feature, if it is turned on. To take ownership of a selected printer, first logon as the user that will be the new owner. Click the Advanced button in the Security tab of the Printer Properties dialog box, then click the Owner tab. You&#146;ll see the dialog shown in Figure 6.14. Select your account name from the list in the Change Owner To box, and click the Apply or OK button to change the ownership to the selected account.</P>
