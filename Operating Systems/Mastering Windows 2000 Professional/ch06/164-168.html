<p><font size="+1"><b>Adding a Network Printer Using the Directory</B></FONT></P>
<p>When a printer is created and shared on a Windows 2000 computer, you are given the option to publish it to the Directory. If this is done, then installing a network printer is really easy. Using the capabilities of the Active Directory, you don&#146;t need to know the name of the printer, its location, or anything else. Of course, the more you know the easier it will be to find the right printer.
</P>
<p>To install a network printer using the Directory, follow these steps:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the Printers windows and double-click Add Printer. This will start the Add Printer Wizard. Click Next.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When prompted to Locate your Printer, choose the first option Find a Printer in the Directory. Click Next.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Find Printers dialog opens. This tool enables you to search through the Directory looking for any printer that meets your criteria. There are three tabs on the Find Printer dialog: Printers, Features, and Advanced. The Printers tab enables you to search for a shared printer by name, location, or model. The Features tab lets you find a shared printer based on its installed features. The Advanced tab enables you to search based on any criteria that have been published in the Directory for shared printers. Enter the criteria you wish to search for and click Find Now to begin the search.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming you locate a suitable printer in the list of printer that meet your criteria, double-click the printer you want to install. This will close the Find Printer dialog and return you to the Add Printer Wizard.
<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If this printer is not the first printer installed, you will be asked whether your Windows applications should use this printer as the default printer. Answer Yes or No and then click Next.
<dd><b>6.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Add Printer Wizard will display a summary of the options you have chosen as the final dialog, as shown in Figure 6.6. If you are satisfied with the options listed, click Finish.

</DL>
<p>Notice that you are no longer asked to print a test page if you are installing a network printer. The assumption here is that the printer has already been tested when it was installed locally on the print server. If you do want to print a test page for this printer, you can easily do so from the printer&#146;s properties sheet after it is installed. To print a test page, do the following:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the Printers window and right-click the printer you want to test. Choose Properties from the context menu.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the General tab, press the Print Test Page button.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If the test page printed correctly, press OK when you are prompted. If it didn&#146;t print or didn&#146;t print correctly, press the Troubleshoot button.
</DL>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Adding a Local Printer</B></FONT></P>
<p>Adding a local printer is much easier in Windows 2000 than it was in NT 4. Thanks to Plug and Play, Windows 2000 can detect your printer if it is physically connected to your computer and turned on. If you want to add a local printer rather than a networked printer, follow these steps:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the Printers window and double-click Add Printer to start the Add Printer Wizard.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Next to bring up the Local or Network Printer dialog.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dialog box that asks whether the printer is local or networked click Local Printer. The default here is to have the Automatically Detect My Printer option checked. This allows Windows 2000 to automatically detect any locally attached printer. If Windows 2000 can detect the printer, this will be the last step. If the printer cannot be detected then you will need to run the wizard again with the option for automatic detection disabled. Click the Next button.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you need to run the Add Printer Wizard again because your printer could not be detected, first be certain that it is connected and turned on, then proceed with the following steps.
<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Next button. Now you&#146;ll see a list of ports. You must tell Windows 2000 what port or ports to use. (A port usually refers to the connector on the computer.) Most often the port will be the parallel printer port called LPT1 (Line Printer 1). Unless you know your printer is connected to another port, such as LPT2 or a serial port (such as COM1 or COM2), select LPT1 as in Figure 6.7. Here are some additional guidelines for choosing port settings:
<dl>
<br>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The most common setting is LPT1 because most PC-type printers hook up to the LPT1 parallel port. Click the Configure Port button if you want to turn off the capability to print to this printer from DOS programs.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you know your printer is of the serial variety, it&#146;s probably connected to the COM1 port. If COM1 is tied up for use with some other device, such as a modem, use COM2. If you choose a COM port, click Configure Port to check the communications settings in the dialog box. Set the baud rate, data bits, parity, start and stop bits, and flow control to match those of the printer being attached. Refer to the printer&#146;s manual to determine the correct settings.
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If your printer is attached through the Universal Serial Bus (USB), it should be detected immediately. USB devices depend upon Plug and Play for their detection and installation. If your printer is not automatically detected when you start Windows 2000, use the Add Hardware Wizard to detect it.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The File choice is for printing to a disk file instead of to the printer. Later, the file can be sent directly to the printer or sent to someone via a floppy disk or modem. When you print to this printer name, you are prompted to enter a filename. See the section &#147;Printing to a Disk File&#148; for further details.

<dd><b>6.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#146;re presented with a list of manufacturers and models. Scroll through the list in the left column, find the maker of your printer, and click it. Then, in the right column, choose the model number or name that matches your printer. Be sure to select the exact printer model, not just the correct brand name. Consult your printer&#146;s manual if you&#146;re in doubt about the model. What you enter here determines which printer driver file is used for this printer&#146;s definition.
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If your printer isn&#146;t included in the list, see the next section, &#147;Adding a Printer That Is Not on Windows 2000&#146;s List.&#148;<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>You can select more than one port if you like. This means you can configure a &#147;printer&#148; to actually be more than one printer. Any jobs sent to this printer name will be printed on the first available printer. A single printer controlling multiple print devices is called a &#147;printer pool,&#148; and is used to provide fast printing in high volume printing environments.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<dd><b>7.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Next button. Now you can give the printer a name. If the printer will be shared with DOS and 16-bit Windows users (such as people running Windows for Workgroups 3.11), you might want to limit this name to an 8.3 format name, because that&#146;s the maximum length those users will see when they are browsing for printers.
<dd><b>8.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set whether the printer will be the default printer for Windows programs.
<dd><b>9.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Next you are asked whether this printer should be shared on the network. If you select Shared, enter a share name for the printer. You can even conceal the fact that a printer exists but still share it with the network for a chosen few to access. To do this, attach a dollar sign (&#36;) to the end of the printer share name. This way, the printer name will not show up on the list of networked printers, but if a user types in the name by hand, he or she will be able to connect to the printer.
<dd><b>10.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill in any information you want to publish about this printer. It&#146;s helpful to provide a location for the printer, and possibly a comment that describes the printer. When you are satisfied, click Next.
<dd><b>11.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you are prompted to print a test page. It is a very good idea to print and save the test page at this point, since it displays your printer&#146;s ability to print graphics and text, and gives you a list of the necessary files for this printer&#146;s configuration. Click Next.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Windows 2000 displays a summary of the configurations you have chosen. Read through the list before clicking Finish just to be sure you have everything you need. When you click Finish, Windows 2000 will copy the files needed to create the printer configuration on your computer. Notice that Windows 2000 already has the drivers on the hard disk. This is because the driver and information files are preloaded when you install Windows 2000. This feature is a great time saver over earlier versions of NT where you always had to have your CD-ROM with you when you installed hardware.<hr></FONT>
