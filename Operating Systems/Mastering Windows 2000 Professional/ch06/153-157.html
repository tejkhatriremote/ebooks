<p>Windows 2000&#146;s print feature mix is quite rich. Here are the highlights:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can add, modify, and remove printers right from Printers folder (available from My Computer, Explorer, the Start button, or Control Panel).
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can set up multiple printers for one physical print device, or vice versa. This enables you to set different schedules, priorities, and permissions for the device.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&#146;t need to think about the relationship of printer drivers, connections, and physical printers because an object-oriented interface using printer icons eliminates that abstraction. You can simply add a printer and set its properties. Once added, it appears as a named printer in the Printers folder.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;After you set up a printer, you can easily choose to share a printer on the network so others can print to it. You can give the device a useful name, such as LaserJet in Fred&#146;s Office, so people on the network know what it is.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When sharing a printer on the network, you can choose to also install one or more Windows 2000 printer drivers for other Windows 2000 platforms, for earlier versions of NT, and/or for Windows 9<i>x</I> stations. These drivers are then provided &#147;automagically&#148; to other printer users, sparing them the task of loading their own printer driver manually (and ensuring that the correct printer driver will always be used by the others accessing this printer). If you&#146;re on a network, you can manage network-printer connections by displaying available printers, sharing your local printer, and connecting to and disconnecting from network printers.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When sharing a printer on the network, you can conduct printer-access auditing, set ownership, set which time periods the printer is available for use on the network, and restrict who has access to the printer.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can start printing and immediately go back to work; you don&#146;t need to wait until spooling for Print Manager is done. While one document is printing, other programs can start print jobs. Additional documents are simply added to the queue and print in turn. Windows 2000&#146;s multithreading and preemptive multitasking make 32-bit Windows programs print more smoothly than under Windows 3.<i>x</I>.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&#146;t need to manually set options such as number of copies, paper tray, page orientation, and so forth. Defaults are automatically used during print jobs.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;To quell your curiosity, you can open a window displaying jobs being printed or jobs in the queue waiting to be printed, along with an indication of the current print job&#146;s progress.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can easily rearrange the order of the print queue and delete print jobs.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can choose whether printing begins as soon as the first page is spooled to the hard disk or after the last page of a document is spooled.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can temporarily pause or resume printing without causing printer time-out problems.

<p>If your printer is already installed and seems to be working fine, you probably can skip this section. In fact, if you&#146;re interested in nothing more than printing from one of your programs without viewing the queue, printing to a network printer, or adjusting your current printer&#146;s settings, skip to the &#147;Printing from a Program&#148; section. However, if you need to install a new printer, modify or customize your current installation, or add printers to your setup, read on to learn how to
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Add a new printer.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the printer port and make other connection settings.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set preferences for a printer.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Install a printer driver that&#146;s not listed.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the default printer.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select a printer when more than one is installed.

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading4"></A><font color="#000077">About Printer Installation</FONT></H4>
<p>Before installing hardware, including printers, you should read any last-minute printed or on-screen material that comes with Windows 2000. Often, such material is full of useful information about specific types of hardware, including printers. Because these are last-minute details, we can&#146;t include them in this book. Look for a <tt>readme</TT> file (or something similar) on your Desktop that you can open by double-clicking. Then look through the file for information about your printer.</P>
<p>With that said, here is the overall game plan for adding a new printer. It&#146;s an easy process thanks to the Add Printer Wizard that walks you through it.</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose Add Printer from the Printers folder.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Specify whether the printer is local (directly connected to your computer) or on the network.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Specify what kind of printer it is.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the printer&#146;s port and relevant port settings.
<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Give the printer a name.
<dd><b>6.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Print a test page.
<dd><b>7.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Check and possibly alter the default printer settings, such as the dots per inch (dpi) and memory settings.
</DL>
<p>After these steps are complete, your printer should work as expected. After a printer is installed, you can customize its setup by modifying its properties as shown in Figure 6.1; for example, you can
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Specify the amount of time you want Windows to keep trying to print a document before alerting you to a printer problem.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Specify the share name for the printer so other network users can find it when they search the network for printers.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set job defaults pertaining to paper tray, two-sided printing, and paper orientation.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stipulate a <i>separator file</I> (a file, usually one page long, that prints between each print job).
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the default printer if you have more than one printer installed.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose whether your printer should substitute its own fonts for certain Windows TrueType fonts.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select printer settings relevant to page orientation, color matching, grayscaling, size scaling, type of paper feed, halftone imaging, and when file header information (such as a PostScript preamble) is sent to the printer.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set whether you want to share the printer for use by others on the network.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set whether documents will go directly to the printer or will go through the spooler.

<p>The good news is that normally you won&#146;t need to fuss with any of these settings. The other good news is that, like the Windows NT 4 interface, with Windows 2000, getting to any one of these settings is a piece of cake. You don&#146;t need to wind your way through a bevy of dialog boxes to target a given setting. The Properties dialog box has tabs, so it&#146;s a cinch to find the one you want. We cover these options in the &#147;Customizing Your Printer&#148; section.
