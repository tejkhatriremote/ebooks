<h3><a name="Heading30"></A><font color="#000077">Browsing&#151;An Overview</FONT></H3>
<p>When entering the Network Neighborhood, you are looking at a list of resources that are available across the network. In essence, you are &#147;window shopping&#148; (pardon the pun), or browsing the network. The Browse list, which is the list of resources that Network Neighborhood provides, simply shows you what is being shared across the network. The Browse list does not determine whether you can access these resources; that would be the responsibility of the permissions that are set in each machine, as we discussed earlier in the chapter.
</P>
<p>In Microsoft networking, some computers have the task of maintaining this list and providing it to other workstations. The machines that perform this function are called <i>browse masters.</I> The unique aspect of the Microsoft browse master concept is that no one computer is fixed as the browse master. Instead, one computer is automatically &#147;elected&#148; as the browse master, in a manner that we&#146;ll soon describe. (By the way, we also have <i>backup master browsers</I>, or machines that back up the browse master.)</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>In some Microsoft literature, browse masters are called <i>master browsers</I>, so you may see either term.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>For example, you see a Browse list when you&#146;re in My Network Places. Open the My Network Places folder and double click Computers Near Me, and it will look something like Figure 24.17.
</P>
<p><a name="Fig19"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch24/images/24-19.jpg',548,383)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch24/images/24-19t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch24/images/24-19.jpg',548,383)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 24.17</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;My Network Places</P>
<p>The My Network Places window shows you the machines that are nearby (we&#146;ll define &#147;nearby&#148; in a minute) and offers you access to the entire network. The machines Holly, Starbug, Blackwolf, and so on are all servers in the sense that they offer resources&#151;shared printers or directories; Spiritwolf is an NT Server.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading31"></A><font color="#000077">Understanding How Browsing Works</FONT></H4>
<p>Chances are that you&#146;ve used My Network Places dozens of times and never wondered how it worked; most likely, it just <i>worked</I>.</P>
<p>But if you ever saw the flashlight shine back and forth for a few minutes, followed by a blank folder or a &#147;Network is not available&#148; message, then you probably wondered just how My Network Places works&#151;or <i>doesn&#146;t</I> work.</P>
<p>Browsing is an example of a <i>client-server</I> software system. Your Windows 2000 Professional computer runs the client software, which interrogates the browse master.</P>
<p>The browse master runs the other half of the operation, which is the browse server software. As we&#146;ve already told you, you needn&#146;t anoint one PC as the browse master. Actually, the PCs all get together and jointly determine which of their number should be the browse master.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading32"></A><font color="#000077">Electing a Master Browser</FONT></H4>
<p>If there is no master browser, then the PCs hold an <i>election</I> to determine which computer would best be master browser. Elections are held when the master browser is powered down gracefully and other times as required.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Consequently, if the master browser is turned off, then it may take a good while (almost an hour in some cases) before another one becomes active.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>If you&#146;re not a master browser, then you&#146;re a backup browser (<i>browser backups</I> in some Microsoft documents), a potential browser, or you&#146;ve opted out of the whole election process. (We&#146;ll show you how to do that in a minute.) Backup browsers are important because they are the ones giving you the Browse list. The general process that occurs when you open My Network Places is this:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your computer sends out a broadcast to locate the master browser.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The master browser responds with the list of backup browsers.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your computer chooses a backup browser at random from the list and contacts that computer asking for the Browse list.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The selected backup browser responds with the Browse list.
</DL>
<p>When an election occurs, the master browser is chosen with a scoring system that works like this:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The master browser is chosen from among the first four computers to respond to the election. The computer with the highest criteria among the first four will win.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;NT Servers beat NT Workstations, which beat everything else (Windows 9<i>x</I>, Windows for Workgroups clients, or LAN Manager servers).
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Domain Controller (which holds the master copy of the user database) will always be the master browser for the domain. Backup domain controllers will always be at least a backup browser. In Windows 2000, all domain controllers are equal if you are using Active Directory, so a Windows 2000 domain controller will always be at least a backup browser.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a tie, then the election goes to the first computer that responded. Although Microsoft isn&#146;t too clear on this, machine type plays a role&#151;Pentiums are preferred over 486s.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If no NT or Windows 2000 machines are responding, then the election takes place among the Windows 9<i>x</I> workstations that have their MaintainServerList setting set to Auto or Yes.
</DL>
<p>That last part is what you should be worried about.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading33"></A><font color="#000077">Browsing in General</FONT></H4>
<p>Thus far we have seen that browsing is a method whereby servers on the network tell a computer called the master browser who they are and what they offer to the users of the network. The browsing service in Microsoft enterprise networks makes it possible for a workstation to see what the network has to offer. A few specifics about browsing:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The master browser designates one backup browser for about every 15 computers.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you run multiple transport protocols, then each transport protocol needs its own set of browsers.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Backup browsers verify their database with the master browser every 15 minutes.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Every 12 minutes the master browser contacts the domain master browser (Domain Controller) to exchange Browse lists.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Servers first announce their existence to the master browser; then they re-announce their existence periodically. Eventually, they &#147;settle down&#148; to announcing themselves only once every 12 minutes on every installed protocol.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you want to find out which computer is the master browser on your Windows 2000 Server-based network, then you can use the <tt>browmon.exe</TT> program that comes with the Windows 2000 Resource Kit.<hr></FONT>
