<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading13"></A><font color="#000077">Taking Ownership</FONT></H4>
<p>Notice the option to Change Owner To in the Owner dialog box. A user called Joe can&#146;t force himself onto the permissions list for <tt>\CHALLENGER\EUDORA</TT>, but if he has the Take Ownership permission he <i>can</I> become the owner, and once he&#146;s the owner, <i>then</I> he can add himself to the permissions list.</P>
<p>If Joe highlights his name in the Change Owner To list and clicks Ok, he can become the owner of the object. But Joe can&#146;t see what&#146;s in Eudora because Joe is still not on the permissions list.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Owners of files can&#146;t necessarily access those files. All that the owners of files can do is change the permissions on those files.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Okay, then, how does Joe get to Eudora? Well, since Joe is an owner, Joe can change permissions. So Joe will add himself to the permissions list and <i>then</I> gain access to Eudora.</P>
<p>Now, why was Joe able to do that? Because of a user right that all administrators have by default: Take Ownership of Files and Other Objects. Perhaps if you were a more user-oriented than administrator-oriented company, you could remove the Administrators group from that right. By doing so, however, an administrator would be unable to poke around a user&#146;s area.</P>
<p>Further, users can always shore up their security just a bit by taking control of their home directory from the administrators. Recall that users have Full Control of their home directory, and Full Control includes the ability to take ownership of an object.</P>
<p>And if you&#146;re concerned about an administrator being able to take control at any time&#151;where&#146;s the security in that?&#151;then consider that the administrator must <i>take</I> ownership in order to add herself to the object&#146;s permissions list. In doing that, she leaves fingerprints behind; if you log on one day and find that you&#146;re no longer the owner of something that you owned yesterday, then you know that an administrator has been snooping&#151;and if file auditing is in place, then you can even find out who snooped.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>You can&#146;t <i>give</I> ownership; you can only exercise the permission to take ownership. If an administrator were to take ownership of a file, they could not edit the file and then give ownership back to the original owner.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>To summarize permissions and ownership:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;By default, new files and new subdirectories inherit permissions from the directory in which they are created.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A user who creates a file or directory is the owner of that file or directory, and the owner can always control access to the file or directory by changing the permissions on it.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you change the permissions on an existing directory, you can choose whether those changes will apply to all files and subdirectories within the directory.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Users and groups can be denied access to a file or directory simply by not granting the user or group any permissions for it. You don&#146;t have to assign No Access to every user or group that you want to keep out of a file or directory.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>It is possible to lock out everyone including the operating system itself if you do not apply permissions correctly. Never deny permissions to the Everyone group for the root of your C drive or the System32 folder. Windows 2000 is itself a member of the Everyone group and will be unable to boot if it cannot read files from either location.<hr></FONT>

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading14"></A><font color="#000077">Configuring Your Workstation</FONT></H4>
<p>In Chapter 18, &#147;Understanding the Architecture,&#148; we took a look at the protocols using a three-layer model. This model is particularly helpful as you begin to install the networking software in Windows 2000. Each of the layers in the model represents a step to be performed when installing network client software in Windows 2000. You will recall that the client software had three major components:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Device drivers for the Network Interface Card
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport protocols
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Network software
</DL>
<p>The first step in installing network software is to install the device driver for the Network Interface Card. Microsoft refers to this driver as the <i>adapter</I>. The second step is to install the transport protocol(s) of your choice. The final step is to install your network software.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading15"></A><font color="#000077">Using Adapters</FONT></H3>
<p>The foundation of the entire network software structure is the device driver that you select. Microsoft comes with an assortment of 32-bit device drivers. If the driver you are looking for does not appear on the Windows 2000 driver list, you will have to get a driver from the device manufacturer.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Many NT 4 drivers <i>do</I> work in the Windows 2000 environment. You will want to test this on a driver-by-driver basis. If the driver shipped with NT 4, you should be able to find a driver in Windows 2000 Professional. One problem with using old drivers is that Windows 2000 is using version 5 of the Network Device Interface Specification (NDIS), and you will need to provide compatible drivers and information files to install the drivers.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading16"></A><font color="#000077">Selecting an Adapter</FONT></H4>
<p>To begin the process of network configuration, you must first install a Network Interface Card (NIC). In Windows 2000, as in Windows 9<i>x</I>, this is done by running the Add/Remove Hardware Wizard in Control Panel. If you have multiple NICs in your computer, this process should locate all of them at the same time. If not, simply run the wizard again until you have successfully installed all of your NICs.</P>
<p>Once you have added all of the drivers for your NIC, you can move on to the next portion of the network configuration.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Third-Party Drivers</B></FONT></P>
<p>Microsoft provides an assortment of drivers for Windows 2000. However, if you are using a card that Windows 2000 does not support directly, you will have to get a copy of the driver from the NIC manufacturer. Generally you can download this information via the Internet or from the manufacturer&#146;s BBS site. After you have the third-party driver in hand, you can install the NIC driver as explained in the previous section. When you get to the part of the adapter installation where you specify the NIC that you have in your system, choose the Have Disk option and point to the drive and directory where the NIC driver is located.
</P>
<p>If you downloaded a driver for NT 4, you should check whether it will work in Windows 2000; if it doesn&#146;t, try a driver designed for use in Windows 98.</P><p><br></P>
