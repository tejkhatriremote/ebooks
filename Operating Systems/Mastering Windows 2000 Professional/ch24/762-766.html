<p>Often, as you configure your system to support multiple protocols, you are concerned with the order in which your computer will search the protocol stacks to perform a specific network function. If the search order for the protocols is not efficient, you can spend a lot of time waiting for your computer to time out because it is searching the wrong protocol stack. Do not be concerned about the order of the protocols as they appear at this time. You will be able to change the search order of the protocols by using the Advanced menu of the Network and Dial-Up Connections window.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Network bindings are a path from the Workstation or Server service to a specific network adapter. There will be one binding for each possible path through the installed protocols. Windows NT and Windows 2000 do not use the binding order when making connections as a client; instead, they attempt to use all installed protocols simultaneously. The first protocol to connect is the one used for the communication session. The binding order <i>does</I> matter for the Server service, however, because the computer will respond with one protocol at a time as determined by the binding order. It is important to set the binding order to use the most common protocol first if you must have multiple protocols installed.<hr></FONT>

<p><font size="+1"><b>Cautions about Third-Party Drivers</B></FONT></P>
<p>You may end up with a driver that represents the vendor&#146;s first attempt at writing 32-bit drivers for NT. So regardless of the version of the software driver, you may be running &#147;version 1&#148; of the 32-bit version of the NIC driver. (As the industry seems to know, everyone shies away from using version 1 of any software because it is often buggy.)
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Remember that you might be using &#147;version 1&#148; of a third-party vendor&#146;s driver (a driver that is not shipped with the Windows 2000 product).<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>If Windows 2000 does not provide a driver for your hardware, our first recommendation is to use a driver that came on a floppy disk with the NIC. A vendor&#146;s home page on the Internet is another source for the latest drivers; many vendors also have a forum on CompuServe or America Online. We would encourage you to do some online investigating before you attempt to load the driver the first time. We are big proponents of heading off problems before they arise.

<h3><a name="Heading19"></A><font color="#000077">Adding and Configuring Services</FONT></H3>
<p>In NT 4, whenever you wanted to add functionality to your system, such as TCP/IP support, Remote Access Service, or Macintosh connectivity, you went to the main window and clicked Control Panel <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch24/images/24-04i.jpg"> Network <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch24/images/24-05i.jpg"> Services. If you are familiar with this series of commands, you will immediately realize how much easier your life has just become. In Windows 2000, you add and configure services from the same place you added protocols earlier in this chapter. The Properties sheet for your Local Area Connection is your one-stop shopping place for network services, protocols, and other components.</P>
<p>The initial dialog box presents a list of the Network Services, Protocols, and Network Clients that are installed on your system. As expected, to add a service, click the Install button and this time choose Service as the type of component to add. A list of Microsoft-provided services appears, as shown in Figure 24.11. You will most likely add third-party services here at a higher rate than you do elsewhere in Windows 2000. One of the advantages of loading services is that services continue to run, even if no one is currently logged onto your system. As long as your system is powered on, the services will perform their normal tasks. The Services tab is where you install and remove services. This location is also where you configure the parameters for an individual service. The Services tab is <i>not</I> the location for starting and stopping a service; you perform that task from Control Panel <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch24/images/24-06i.jpg"> Administrative Tools <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch24/images/24-07i.jpg"> Computer Management <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch24/images/24-08i.jpg"> System Tools <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch24/images/24-09i.jpg"> Services.</P>

<p>Here are a few services to which you should pay close attention:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Server Service
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Workstation Service
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Service
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer Browser Service
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>In Windows 2000, these services are included within the components listed in the Properties of your Local Area Connection. The Client for Microsoft Networks includes the Workstation service and RPC service, while the File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks includes the Server service and the Computer Browser service.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading20"></A><font color="#000077">Server Service</FONT></H4>
<p>The Server Service enables remote clients to access the resources of this machine. If you want other users to have access to files that are located in directories on your machine, or if you want other users to print to a printer that is physically attached to your computer, you will want to enable the Server Service. There is nothing to configure for this service. You simply install it and then you can turn it off or on. This service is installed by default if you installed networking during Windows 2000 Setup.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading21"></A><font color="#000077">Workstation Service</FONT></H4>
<p>This service enables you to make requests of the network. If you want to access servers, network printers, or have remote access, you must start the Workstation Service. This is another default if you chose to install networking during Setup.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading22"></A><font color="#000077">Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Service</FONT></H4>
<p>This service enables you to communicate with other services. It works in conjunction with the Server and Workstation Services. The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) provides a common communications standard from which other processes can communicate and interact. The power of the RPC service as implemented in Windows 2000 is that it supports multiple APIs, including Novell sockets, Windows sockets, TCP/IP sockets, and NetBIOS.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading23"></A><font color="#000077">Computer Browser Service</FONT></H4>
<p>The Computer Browser Service permits you to participate in the election process for a master browser and backup browsers. In addition, it enables you to announce your resources that are being shared. In essence, without this service, you cannot make resources from your computer available to others via the Browse list. The absence of the Computer Browser Service doesn&#146;t stop you from sharing resources; it just stops others from seeing your resources via the Browse list. Remote users can still access the resources by using the proper Net statements at the command line prompt. For example, they can issue a statement such as <tt>NET USE G:\\servername\sharename</TT> to access a particular resource. Its absence will also interfere with your ability to use Network Neighborhood to browse network resources.</P><p><br></P>
