<p><big><big>O</BIG></BIG>ne of the most powerful features of Windows 2000 Professional is its capability to attach to and become part of a networking environment. In this chapter we examine many of the decisions that you will need to make in order to get the networking features to run reliably in that environment.</P>
<p>The whole idea of a network is to share things: share space on a large disk drive, share a particular file on that disk drive, and share a printer. As an example, let&#146;s consider a small office that needs to do some sharing.</P>
<p>In our office, Jennifer has more storage capacity on her machine than Joe does on his, but the office laser printer is attached to Joe&#146;s PC. Jennifer and Joe work on the office accounting system, so they need to share the accounting files&#151;or they&#146;ll have to pass floppies back and forth. Because Jennifer has more disk space, they put the accounting files on her machine. So, the network problems that we need to solve are:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharing Joe&#146;s printer with Jennifer
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharing Jennifer&#146;s disk with Joe
</DL>
<p>Let&#146;s solve their problem with a basic Microsoft network. With this type of network, Jennifer puts her hard disk on the network and Joe puts his printer on the network. Assuming that both computers are running Windows 95, here&#146;s how to get Joe onto Jennifer&#146;s disk and Jennifer onto Joe&#146;s printer:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Jennifer tells the Windows 95 networking software, &#147;Offer the Acctng subdirectory on my C drive to anyone who wants it. Call it Acctng.&#148; In Microsoft enterprise networking terminology, Acctng becomes the <i>share name</I> of that drive on Jennifer&#146;s machine (GTW09), and it&#146;s the name that others will use to access the drive over the network. In a few pages we&#146;ll show you exactly how to share such a resource on the network so others can access it, but for now, remember these important facts: A machine (named GTW09) is sharing a resource called Acctng with anyone on that network who&#146;s able to use it.
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Here&#146;s an important concept in Microsoft networking: You must name each machine in the network, whether it is a server or a workstation. You also must name each user (in our example, Joe and Jennifer). Because the PCs need names, we may as well name the PCs with their inventory numbers, which in this example are DELL05 and GTW09.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Naming machines after their users is a bad idea, because PCs may be reassigned to other users.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe then tells the networking software on his PC, &#147;Attach me to the Acctng resource on Jennifer&#146;s machine.&#148;
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe, meanwhile, runs his network software and tells it to share the printer on his LPT1 port, giving it a name&#151;again, a share name&#151;of JOLASER. Joe&#146;s machine is called DELL05, so the UNC name of that printer will be <tt>\\DELL05\JOLASER</TT>.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Jennifer then tells her networking software to attach JOLASER on Joe&#146;s machine to her LPT1 port.
</DL>
<p>From now on, whenever Jennifer tells an application program to print to a LaserJet on LPT1, the network software will intercept the printed output and will direct it over the network to Joe&#146;s machine. The networking software on Joe&#146;s machine will then print the information on Joe&#146;s printer.
</P>
<p>We know we left out some of the &#147;how do we do this?&#148; information; it&#146;s coming later, we promise. We just wanted to illustrate the following concepts:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Machines and people in a Microsoft network have names.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared resources in those networks also have names.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You specify network resource names with UNC names, in the format <tt>\\servername\sharename</TT>.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;One way (and the most common way) to share network resources is to give them bogus local names, such as D or LPT1.
</DL>

<table border="2" bordercolor="#0000" align="CENTER">
<tr><td><font size="+1"><b>Naming a Network Resource</B></FONT>
<p>For years, PC workstation operating systems haven&#146;t understood networking, so we&#146;ve had to introduce network resources in the back door by showing these resources as <i>logical drives</I> or, in the terminology of some networks, <i>mapped drives</I>. We might say that the Acctng resource is <i>mapped</I> to local drive D for Joe. Joe doesn&#146;t know whether Acctng is all of Jennifer&#146;s drive or just part of it. Joe&#146;s networking software then says something like, &#147;You&#146;re now attached to Acctng on Jennifer&#146;s machine. It will appear to you as local drive D.&#148;</P>
<p>Actually, we should mention that Windows 2000 Professional doesn&#146;t require drive letter mapping. We mention it because virtually every previous PC network operating system required it and because most applications to this day can still address network resources only by letter names. Again, Joe doesn&#146;t <i>have</I> a D drive on his machine; he only has network software that takes read and write requests for a mythical drive D and reformulates those requests into network communication with Jennifer&#146;s machine.</P>
<p>And, while we&#146;re on the subject, the actual name of this network resource is <tt>\\gtw09\ acctng</TT>. Notice the <tt>\\gtw09\acctng</TT> term; it&#146;s called a <i>Universal Naming Convention</I> name, or a UNC name. The two backslashes are a warning that the name following is a <i>machine</I> name, and the backslash after that refers to the <i>share name</I> <tt>acctng</TT> rather than the directory name.</P>

<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Understanding Networking Concepts</FONT></H3>
<p>A fundamental term in Microsoft networking is a <i>server;</I> any machine that shares resources is a server.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">Network Server and Workstation Types</FONT></H4>
<p>Various types of machines can operate as servers in the Microsoft world. Let&#146;s name them now:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 98 workstations
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 95 workstations
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows for Workgroups machines
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;NT Workstation computers
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;NT Server computers
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 2000 Professional computers
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 2000 Server computers
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;LAN Manager servers
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;OS/2 LAN Servers
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;DOS-based machines running LANtastic
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;OS/2 Warp Connect machines
</DL>
<p>The machines that can act only as <i>workstations</I> are those that are running one of the following:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 3.<i>x</I>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;DOS
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;OS/2 1.<i>x</I> and 2.<i>x</I>
