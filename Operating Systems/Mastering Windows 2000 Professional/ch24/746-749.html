<p>You&#146;ve already seen that network shares have three types of permission levels: Read, Change, and Full Control. File and directory permissions offer more options; you can see those options in Table 24.3.

<p>Basically, the Change permission in share-level permissions is divided into three permissions under file and directory permissions:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>Write</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lets you write files. As a side effect, it also lets you <i>over</I>write files, so by saving a new file on top of an old file you can delete it, even if you don&#146;t have Delete permission.
<dd><b>Execute</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lets you execute a program, usually one with an <tt>.exe</TT> extension. If you do not have Execute permission, you can&#146;t run a program even if you can see it.
<dd><b>Delete</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is intended to prevent you from deleting a file, but it seems useless; we&#146;ve had no trouble deleting files that we did not have Delete permissions for. It <i>does</I> seem useful for directories, however; you can&#146;t delete directories if you lack Delete permissions for that directory.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>You don&#146;t get much mileage out of giving someone Read and Write permissions and then not giving Execute permissions, because anyone who <i>did</I> want to run the program could just copy the file to a local directory. The copy would end up with the same permissions as everything else in the local directory (which probably includes Execute), and that person could run the copied file. What the Execute permission is useful for is the <i>opposite</I> application&#151;give someone Execute access but no other access, and the person can <i>run</I> a program but not copy or modify it. The value is that people can run a program on the network, but not download it to their local machines&#151;and perhaps to floppy disks or Zip drives&#151;and from there steal the application.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you assign someone Full Control permission for a folder, then give them No Access to a file in that folder, the user <i>will</I> be able to delete the file. This is the one loophole in the No Access permission and was designed into NTFS to support the requirements of the POSIX subsystem.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Permissions applied to a file take precedence over permissions applied to the folder. The assumption here is that if you care enough about the file to set permissions, they must be more important than the folder&#146;s permissions.<hr></FONT>

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading9"></A><font color="#000077">File and Directory Permissions vs. Share Permissions</FONT></H4>
<p>One important thing to understand about file and directory permissions is, as we&#146;ve mentioned, that they work whether you&#146;re networked or not. You access share-level permissions in the Sharing tab. Directory permissions show up in a separate tab labeled Security. To see the Security tab, right-click any file or directory <i>on an NTFS volume</I> from the My Computer or Explorer windows, and you&#146;ll see a dialog box similar to the one in Figure 24.4.</P>
<p><a name="Fig4"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch24/images/24-04.jpg',367,443)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch24/images/24-04t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch24/images/24-04.jpg',367,443)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 24.4</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Security tab of the Eudora Properties dialog box shows in this instance that Everyone has Full Control.</P>
<p>Even though Eudora is shared in the preceding example, it would have a Security tab whether it was shared or not. The Security tab displays the list of permitted users, as well as giving you the option of granting or denying access through each permission level as shown in Figure 24.4.
</P>
<p>You may recall that the share-level permissions on Eudora was just Everyone/Full Control. But that Full Control is quite a bit different from the Full Control in the Directory Permissions dialog box&#151;why? Understanding the answer to that question will drive home an important point about file and directory permissions.</P>
<p>The Eudora folder had file and directory permissions specified on it <i>before</I> it was shared. Merely sharing it and creating a list of share permissions <i>does not affect the file and directory permissions at all</I>. Here&#146;s an extreme example: Suppose Eudora had file and directory permissions that allowed only a user named Meredith to access it. Then suppose Eudora was shared with share permissions that allowed only one other user, named Martin, to share access to Eudora. After Eudora was shared, no change would appear on the file and directory permissions for Eudora. Although the share-level permissions would allow Martin to access the file, the file and directory permissions would allow only Meredith in.</P>
<p>In this case, what would happen? Could Martin access Eudora? Could Meredith? Could both Martin and Meredith access Eudora or neither? The answer is, neither could access Eudora. When Meredith tried to attach to the share, the share-level permissions would keep her out. When Martin tried to attach to the share, the share-level permissions would give him the thumbs up, but the file system&#146;s permissions would nix the connection.</P>
<p>Now, Meredith could physically walk over to the computer that Eudora sits on, log on, and access the directory. Because she wouldn&#146;t tickle the network software, she wouldn&#146;t be denied access.</P>
<p>To summarize the basic rule of data access on a network share that&#146;s been formatted as NTFS: To access some data on the network, you must have share-level permissions as well as file and directory permissions for that data.</P><p><br></P>
