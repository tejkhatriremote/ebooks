<h3><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">Using the Windows Telephony Interface</FONT></H3>
<p>NT 4 and Windows 9<i>x</I> included TAPI&#151;a set of software hooks to applications that control the way your computer interacts with the telephone network. Windows 2000 also implements TAPI, but it has a newer version that gives you some new capabilities. TAPI is an internal part of the Windows 2000 operating system rather than a specific application program&#151;it provides a standard way for software developers to access communications ports and devices, such as modems and telephone sets, to control data, fax, and voice calls. Using TAPI, an application can place a call, answer an incoming call, and hang up when the call is complete. It also supports features such as hold, call transfer, voicemail, and conference calls. TAPI-compliant applications work with conventional telephone lines, Private Branch Exchange (PBX), and Centrex systems; it also works with specialized services such as cellular and Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN).</P>
<p>By moving these functions to a common program interface, Windows 2000 prevents conflicting demands for access to your modem and telephone line from multiple application programs. Therefore, you no longer need to shut down a program that&#146;s waiting for incoming calls before you use a different program to send a fax.</P>
<p>Unless you&#146;re planning to write your own communications applications, you won&#146;t ever have to deal directly with TAPI, but you will see its benefits when you use the communications programs included in the Windows 2000 package&#151;such as HyperTerminal, Outlook Express, Phone Dialer, and Remote Access&#151;and when you use new, NT or Windows 9<i>x</I>&#150;compatible versions of third-party communications programs such as ProComm and WinFax.</P>
<p>Windows 2000 includes a fairly simple telephony application called Phone Dialer, (which we talk about later in this chapter), but this application only begins to show what TAPI can do. NT 4 also included Phone Dialer, but the new version found in Windows 2000 is a whole new animal. Phone Dialer now delivers on some of the promise that TAPI showed us in NT and Windows 95. This application can not only dial the phone, it can connect to video conference sessions over your local area network (LAN) or place a voice call to an Internet address by modem or network connection.</P>
<p>Eventually, you can expect to see a lot of new Windows Telephony products that will move control of your telephone to the Windows 2000 Desktop. For example, you might be able to use the telephone company&#146;s caller-ID service to match incoming calls to a database that displays detailed information about the caller before you answer, or you may be able to use an on-screen menu to set up advanced call features such as conference calling and call forwarding, which now require obscure strings of digits from the telephone keypad.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading4"></A><font color="#000077">Installing a Modem</FONT></H3>
<p>Every time you installed a new communications application in earlier versions of Windows or NT, you had to go through another configuration routine&#151;you had to specify the port connected to your modem, the highest speed the modem could handle, and so forth. Because there was no central modem control, each program required its own setup.
</P>
<p>This changed in NT 4 (and Windows 9<i>x</I>), which uses a <i>universal modem</I> driver called <i>Unimodem</I>. Unimodem is the software interface between all of your computer&#146;s 32-bit Windows-compatible communications applications (including the ones that use TAPI) and your modem or other communications hardware. It includes integrated control for port selection, modem initialization, speed, file transfer protocols, and terminal emulation. Unimodem handles the modem configuration, so you only have to specify setup parameters once.</P>
<p>If you&#146;re using third-party communications applications left over from earlier versions of Windows, they&#146;ll usually work with Windows 2000, but you&#146;ll still have to configure them separately. When you replace them with newer, Windows 2000&#150;compatible updates, they&#146;ll use the settings already configured in your Control Panel.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Some communications packages written for Windows 3.<i>x</I> provided their own version of several key system files such as <tt>comm.drv</TT> or <tt>winsock.dll</TT>. If you install such a program, it may adversely affect your 32-bit communications software by overwriting the system files they depend on.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>In most cases, you need a modem to use Windows 2000&#146;s communications features. Your modem might be an internal expansion board, an external modem plugged into a serial port, or a credit-card-sized PCMCIA modem. You can choose to install a modem during the Network Setup portion of Windows 2000 Setup by telling Setup that your computer will participate on a network through a dial-up connection. To install your modem later, you can use the Phone and Modem Options applet in Control Panel, or you can configure the modem from a communications application such as Phone Dialer or HyperTerminal.
