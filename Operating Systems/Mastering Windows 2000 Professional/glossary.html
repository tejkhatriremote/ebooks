<dt><b>File System</B>
<dd>A software component that manages the storage of files on a mass storage device by providing services that can create, read, write, and delete files. File systems impose an ordered database of files on the mass storage device, called volumes, which use hierarchies of directories to organize files. See <i>Mass Storage Device, Files, Database, Volumes, Directories</I>.
<dt><b>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</B>
<dd>A simple Internet protocol that transfers complete files from an FTP server to a client running the FTP client.

<dt><b>Floppy Disk</B>
<dd>The first convenient removable media mass storage device. Floppy disks typically store 1.44MB of data magnetically on a thin mylar film coated with ferric particles encased in a protective plastic shell. Because floppy disks have been around longer than hard disk drives, most computers are capable of booting operating systems from a floppy disk. See <i>Mass Storage Device</I>.
<dt><b>Format</B>
<dd>The process of preparing a mass storage device for use with a file system. There are actually two levels of formatting. Low-level formatting writes a structure of sectors and tracks to the disk with bits used by the mass storage controller hardware. The controller hardware requires this format, and it is independent of the file system. High-level formatting creates file system structures such as an allocation table and a root directory in a partition, thus creating a volume. See <i>Mass Storage Device, Volume</I>.
<dt><b>Frame</B>
<dd>A data structure that network hardware devices use to transmit data between computers. Frames consist of the addresses of the sending and receiving computers, size information, and a check sum. Frames are envelopes around packets of data that allow them to be addressed to specific computers on a shared media network. See <i>Ethernet, Fiber Distributed Data Interface, Token Ring</I>.
<dt><b>FTP</B>
<dd>See <i>File Transfer Protocol</I>.

A cursor driven by a pointing device such as a mouse manipulates the objects. Typically, icons that can be opened into windows that show the data contained by the object represent the objects. See <i>Shell, Explorer</I>.
<dt><b>Group Identifiers</B>
<dd>Security identifiers that contain the set of permissions allowed to a group. When a user account is part of a group, the group identifier is appended to that user&#146;s security identifier, thus granting the individual user all the permissions assigned to that group. See <i>Security Identifiers, Accounts, Permissions</I>.
<dt><b>Groups</B>
<dd>Security entities to which users can be assigned membership for the purpose of applying the broad set of group permissions to the user. By managing permissions for groups and assigning users to groups, rather than assigning permissions to users, security administrators can keep coherent control of very large security environments. See <i>Permissions, Accounts, Security</I>.

<dt><b>Write-Back Caching</B>
<dd>A caching optimization wherein data written to the slow store is cached until the cache is full or until a subsequent write operation overwrites the cached data. Write-back caching can significantly reduce the write operations to a slow store because many write operations are subsequently obviated by new information. Data in the write-back cache is also available for subsequent reads. If something happens to prevent the cache from writing data to the slow store, the cache data will be lost. See <i>Caching</I>, <i>Write-Through Caching</I>.
<dt><b>Write-Through Caching</B>
<dd>A caching optimization wherein data written to a slow store is kept in a cache for subsequent re-reading. Unlike write-back caching, write-through caching immediately writes the data to the slow store and is therefore less optimal but more secure.
