<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading29"></A><font color="#000077">Make Sure You Have the Hardware</FONT></H4>
<p>I&#146;ve already said that you should buy hardware from the HCL whenever possible, so I&#146;m not going to repeat myself. But something that&#146;s just as important is to <i>buy enough horsepower</I>.</P>
<p>All of Windows 2000&#146;s powers come at a price: speed. Run Windows 9<i>x</I> and Windows 2000 on the same system, and you can&#146;t help but notice the difference in performance between the two. Here are a few suggestions about how to spend your money to assemble a decent Windows 2000 machine.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Processor</B></FONT></P>
<p>If you&#146;re definitely committed to Windows 2000, then consider buying Pentium II- or Pentium III-based systems, rather than Pentium systems. Recall that the Pentium Pro through Pentium III chips are especially tuned to run 32-bit programs particularly well, and they offer that performance without the great cost of RISC-based systems.
</P>
<p>No matter what processor you buy, get the most speed you can afford. I&#146;m <i>not</I> going to tell you not to run Windows 2000 on anything below 300MHz. But if all other things are equal, more megahertz means better performance.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Early versions of Windows NT ran on a 386 processor, but Microsoft stopped supporting NT on a 386 as of version 4. Windows 2000 supports the Pentium as the minimum processor requirement.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Memory</B></FONT></P>
<p>I&#146;ve run Windows 2000 on a 333MHz computer and been disappointed by its sluggish performance. I&#146;ve also run it on a 133MHz server and been satisfied with its performance.
</P>
<p>The difference? The 333MHz computer had 32MB of RAM. The server had 64MB of RAM.</P>
<p>I haven&#146;t actually <i>found</I> the point at which Windows 2000 stops thirsting for memory. For example, the computer on my desktop contains 128MB of RAM, and even <i>it</I> shuffles things from memory onto disk now and then.</P>
<p>Thankfully, memory prices have dropped (and risen, then dropped again) and today there aren&#146;t many reasons not to have enough memory. And while I still can&#146;t say what enough memory <i>is</I> for Windows 2000, I can say that today most Windows 2000 users are running on computers with at least 128MB of RAM. Just check out the catalog from your favorite supplier and you will notice that most of the current systems are coming equipped with 128MB of RAM.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>You can&#146;t just put any arbitrary amount of RAM into a computer; the memory sockets in most Pentiums allow only a few memory configurations: 8MB, 16MB, 24MB, 32MB, 40MB, 48MB, 64MB, 72MB, 80MB, 96MB, or 128MB. Newer motherboards support much higher amounts of RAM, but still have specific configurations.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>As the price falls, people will say, &#147;What the heck, as long as I&#146;m upgrading, I&#146;ll go for more memory.&#148; Many folks will jump from 16MB all the way up to 64MB or 96MB, skipping 32MB altogether. Many will try to increase their system&#146;s RAM all the way up to 128MB or even 256MB&#151;and then they may get an unpleasant surprise.
</P>
<p>Part of a computer&#146;s configuration is contained in a chip commonly known as the Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) chip. Calling this specific chip <i>the</I> CMOS is quite misleading&#151;<i>many</I> other chips in a PC could also be called CMOS chips&#151;but that&#146;s the common term. Anyway, the standard CMOS configuration first appeared in 1984 with the IBM AT. The CMOS sets aside 2 bytes, which are defined as the amount of kilobytes of RAM above the first megabyte. The largest value that a 2-byte integer can hold is 64KB-1, or 65,535. So the greatest amount of kilobytes above the first megabyte on a system with a standard CMOS is 65,535KB, or 64 megabytes.</P>
<p>What this bit of mathematics means is that no matter how many memory sockets are on your computer&#146;s motherboard, no matter how much memory you put on your computer, it will recognize only the first 65MB (the 64MB above the first megabyte and then the first megabyte). What&#146;s the answer? Make very certain when you buy the computer that it isn&#146;t afflicted with an ancient CMOS&#151;fortunately, this isn&#146;t very common anymore. Talk to the firm&#146;s technical support people and be sure that (1) they understand the CMOS problem and (2) their computer doesn&#146;t have the problem.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The bottom line on memory is this: On a Windows 2000 machine, the more memory, the merrier.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Video Card</B></FONT></P>
<p>Video cards are one of the most difficult types of hardware to choose for Windows 2000. First of all, what are you looking for? Games? Productivity? OK, admit it, you want a little of both. Today&#146;s games often use high-end 3-D technologies that make them very exciting. Unfortunately, finding the drivers for the 3-D video cards can be hard with NT. Again, thanks to the unified driver model, Windows 2000 will use the same drivers as Windows 98. This means that the new video cards will very likely have driver support for Windows 2000 right out of the box.
</P>
<p>Your best bet is to find out which chipsets are providing the type of performance you want, which cards have that chipset, and finally which manufacturers are providing Windows 2000 drivers.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading30"></A><font color="#000077">Summary</FONT></H3>
<p>Well, by now you know something of why you&#146;d use Windows 2000 (or why you wouldn&#146;t) and what to look for when choosing software and hardware. In the next chapter, you&#146;ll learn about Windows 2000&#146;s structure and architecture.
