<p>Computer graphics is a computer application that boils down to just one thing: CPU power. For years, credible computer graphics required a Cray or a Silicon Graphics (SGI) machine, computers costing in the hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars range.
</P>
<p>The first PC to break into big-time computer graphics was the Commodore Amiga, particularly with its Video Toaster application. The Amiga is still around in an underground sort of way and may make a comeback, but many Amiga users have moved over to NT. An application called LightWave for NT (Alpha and Intel versions only, unfortunately) is basically Video Toaster for NT.</P>

<tr><td><font size="+1"><b>NT at Work</B></FONT>
<p>If you&#146;re a fan of either Warner Brothers&#146; <i>Babylon 5</I> or Fox Television&#146;s <i>Space: Above and Beyond</I> or <i>Sightings</I>, then you&#146;ve seen NT at work. These shows represent a huge amount of work. For example, in one episode of <i>Babylon 5</I>, station commander Sheridan, second-in-command Ivanova, and security chief Garibaldi spend several minutes in &#147;docking bay 13,&#148; which holds a spaceship built by an alien race called the Vorlons. In the sequence, the three humans pick up objects, push buttons, and interact with the Vorlon ship. What makes the sequence interesting is that the whole thing is done on NT. The three actors said their lines in front of a blue screen, which fortunately has no relationship to an NT crash-dump blue screen. The blue background enables the special-effects team to overlay the rest of the set (which is no more than very good computer graphics) with the film of the human actors. (So the next time your Macintosh-using friends get snide about what their computer can do that yours can&#146;t, tell &#146;em about <i>Bab 5</I>!)</P>
<p>One of the first companies to decide to move its line of software to NT was another graphics company, Intergraph. It makes a high-end line of expensive computer-aided design (CAD) workstations that run mainly NT software.</P>
</TABLE>

<p>NT has made major inroads with many Windows software developers. Because developers can write Windows 9<i>x</I> or Windows 3.1 programs inside NT, they like to exploit NT&#146;s stability. Try booting from the installation disks of a few of your favorite Windows 3.1 applications and you may see the message &#147;NTLDR not found,&#148; which means that their original disks were formatted with NT.</P>

<p>If you&#146;ve ever installed a board in a PC, then you know what a pain it can be. If you&#146;ve ever installed a <i>complex</I> board, such as a sound card, then you know that making it work can be a weekend project. That&#146;s why Microsoft and Compaq developed Plug and Play.</P>
<p>Plug and Play is an ambitious project, but here&#146;s a brief description of how it works.</P>
<p>Every device inside your PC uses a combination of some or all of these components, known generically as <i>hardware resources</I>:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Memory addresses
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Input/output (I/O) addresses
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Interrupt request (IRQ) levels
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct memory access (DMA) channels
</DL>
<p>If you&#146;ve never come across any of these items, then don&#146;t be intimidated by the terms; they only <i>sound</I> technical. All you have to know is this: Your computer has a limited number of memory addresses, I/O addresses, IRQ levels, and DMA channels. In general, you cannot assign two devices to use the same hardware resource. For example, if you try to put both your sound card and your local area network on IRQ5, usually neither the sound card nor the local area network card works.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The essence of PC expansion board configuration is to first find out what hardware resources a board needs. Some need just an I/O address, and others need an I/O address and an IRQ level; a few demand an I/O address, an IRQ level, and a DMA channel. The design of a board determines its requirements. The next step is to reconfigure the board so that it doesn&#146;t conflict with any other board&#146;s resources.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>If I wanted to install a sound card into a system, I&#146;d start by finding out that it required three I/O address ranges, an IRQ level, and two DMA channels. (I&#146;m not making this up; your basic 16-bit sound card is a nightmare to configure.) Then I&#146;d determine which resources (memory, I/O, IRQ, and DMA) were free and available on my computer before installing the sound card. After I know what resources my computer currently <i>uses</I>, I can then figure out what resources are <i>available</I>, and I&#146;d tell the sound board to use those unused resources.</P>
<p>Telling the sound board to use those resources sometimes means physically taking the board in hand and moving small electronic contacts called <i>jumpers</I> or tiny switches called <i>dual in-line package (DIP) switches</I>. Or it may mean running a program that comes with the sound board, or a combination of the two. And I&#146;m still not done. Next, I&#146;ll have to load drivers for the sound board, and the drivers will not work until they know which I/O addresses, IRQ level, and DMA channels I selected for the sound board. Reboot, and <i>then</I> I&#146;m done, assuming that I did each step correctly.</P>
<p>In contrast, all Plug-and-Play devices contain <i>smart</I> boards, boards that can be interrogated by the system about their resource needs. At startup, a program in the BIOS called the Configuration Manager asks all Plug-and-Play hardware&#151;Plug-and-Play hardware resides on the PC&#146;s motherboard as well as on expansion boards&#151;to announce its existence. The Configuration Manager then asks each of the boards, &#147;What resources do you need?&#148; They respond, and the Configuration Manager figures out what configuration will make all the boards happy. It then sets the memory addresses, I/O addresses, IRQ levels, and DMA channels on all the Plug-and-Play hardware and commences the boot process. This procedure sounds time-consuming but requires only a second.</P>
<p>Notice that so far, the operating system is irrelevant; a Plug-and-Play-compliant PC has a Configuration Manager in its BIOS ROM, which runs before the operating system even gets started. But recall that every Plug-and-Play computer completely reconfigures itself whenever you turn it on; this means, in theory, that if you insert a new sound card into your computer, it could set off a chain reaction that would cause the Configuration Manager to reassign all the resources to all the boards.</P><p><br></P>
