<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading15"></A><font color="#000077">Security</FONT></H4>
<p>Security is one of Windows 2000&#146;s A-number-1 raisons d&#146;&#234;tre. NT was designed to fulfill the needs of people requiring high levels of security, and NT is one of the only microcomputer operating systems that has been reviewed for U.S. government&#146;s C2 security standard. Windows 2000 also incorporates this deep-seated need for security.
</P>
<p>Here are some of the ways in which Windows 2000 implements security:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 2000 requires users to log on to a workstation.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 2000 defines user rights that control a user&#146;s actions.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 2000 uses file and printer permissions to control access.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 2000 encrypts security information over networks.
</DL>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Windows 2000 Requires Users to Log On to a Workstation</B></FONT></P>
<p>Windows 9<i>x</I> (for comparison against Windows 2000) has a login screen that appears when you turn it on, but the login procedure is not really secure, for a couple of reasons. First, you can bypass it by pressing Esc. Second, you can always boot a Windows 9<i>x</I> computer with a floppy and run the <tt>regedit.exe</TT> program to export the Registry, a set of files that controls Windows 9<i>x</I>&#146;s configuration.</P>
<p>Windows 2000, in contrast, doesn&#146;t let you do anything on your computer until you log on, identifying yourself by name, password, and whether you want to be acknowledged by a local Windows 2000 domain. (Windows 2000 domains are methods of centrally storing user account information.)</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Windows 2000 Defines User Rights That Control a User&#146;s Actions</B></FONT></P>
<p>Have you ever loaned your machine to someone, only to get it back with all your settings changed? Or, worse yet, to find it loaded with a new piece of software that messed up your <tt>.dll</TT> files or program groups?</P>
<p>The good news is that Windows 2000 divides the range of things that you can do with a computer into <i>user rights</I>. The User Manager enables you to restrict what someone can do on your system. Giving someone else an account on your system doesn&#146;t necessarily mean giving them the keys to your system; it may mean giving them access to only a subset of your computer&#146;s capabilities.</P>
<p>The bad news is that you don&#146;t have the same fine control of user rights in Windows 2000 Professional that you do in Server. The good news is that Windows 2000 enables you to define a local user account that can use the computer and run common programs, but cannot install new programs. Members of the Users group can run programs, and save data to their own folders, but they can&#146;t install programs or modify system files.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Windows 2000 Uses File and Printer Permissions to Control Access</B></FONT></P>
<p>Like its bigger brother Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional lets you point to any given directory and remove a user&#146;s access to that directory. Believe it or not, you can create a local account on a Windows 2000 machine that, at the same time that it lets someone get on your computer and run a particular program, also prevents that user from doing anything else.
</P>
<p>When you examine a file or directory with Explorer, you can right-click a directory or file and one of the buttons you&#146;ll see is Permissions.</P>
<p>Printers, as well as directories and files, have permissions associated with them. You can prevent specific people from using your locally attached printers, and of course, domain network administrators can control which network printers those people can access.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Windows 2000 Encrypts Security Information over Networks</B></FONT></P>
<p>As we depend on networks more and more, security becomes increasingly important. For example, getting onto the World Wide Web and buying flowers, clothes, books, software, and airline tickets is becoming routine. Well, I hope I&#146;m not the first to tell you this, but every transaction that you make over the Web involves transmitting secure information: passwords, account numbers, maybe credit-card numbers. These are things that should remain confidential. Unfortunately, network applications called <i>sniffers</I> can record and display every byte that passes by on the Net.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Windows 2000 Server includes a sniffer called Network Monitor. Windows 2000 Professional does not include this program. But this version is limited to traffic to and from your computer. The full version of Network Monitor, which enables you to see everything that passes over the physical network, is available only in Microsoft System Management Server (SMS).<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>What keeps someone from sniffing the Net and stealing private information? Well, actually, nothing; so the cybershoppers had better <i>encrypt</I> the data before they send it. A number of encrypting protocols are available, and Windows 2000 includes one of its own. With encryption, if you happen to be sniffing the network while someone logs on, you&#146;ll see that someone has logged on but you will not be able to snatch their password or other secure information.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Please note that this security applies only to NT or Windows 2000 and Microsoft networking; Internet communications such as FTP or Web browsing are <i>not</I> secure unless you&#146;re using a specific <i>Internet</I> security protocol, such as Netscape&#146;s Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). <i>Never</I> assume that your Internet communications are secure, even when you use a Windows 2000 workstation.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Windows 2000 Offers a Fault-Tolerant File System</B></FONT></P>
<p>Part of security is knowing that your data is secure. Both Windows 2000 Server and Windows 2000 Professional support a high-performance file system called the New Technology File System (NTFS) that includes the ability to recover from many events (some power failures or software crashes, for example) that would destroy or damage data on DOS machines.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Fault tolerance is available only on Windows 2000 Servers, but you can take it a step further and install Digital NT Clusters, a technology that uses two NT Server machines to act like one machine. If one of the servers fails, the other one picks up quickly. Microsoft has also developed their own version of clustering, implemented in Windows 2000 Advanced Server Edition and Windows 2000 Data Center Server.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Windows 2000 Will Optionally Log All Security Events</B></FONT></P>
<p>Want to keep track of <i>everything</I> that happens on your computer? It&#146;s possible. Windows 2000 includes a Security log that will, at your option, log many events, including the following:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who logged on to your machine, when the person logged on, and when he or she logged off
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What files were used
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When others attempted and failed to log on to your system
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the person who logged on to your system changed any user rights or permissions (if he or she had administrative privileges)
</DL>
<p>All that information goes in the Security log, one of the three logs you can find in the Event Viewer.
