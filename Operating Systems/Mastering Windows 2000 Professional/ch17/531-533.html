<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading22"></A><font color="#000077">Problems Caused by Windows 2000&#146;s Secure Nature</FONT></H4>
<p>Windows 2000&#146;s middle name is <i>security.</I> It can meet the U.S. government C2 security standards, as you read earlier. Security means more than requiring password encryption and forcing you to log on to your own computer. It also means that Windows 2000 is engineered not to crash&#151;after all, stability is a kind of security. Years ago, Bob Muglia, one of NT&#146;s product managers and a very influential force in the design of the first version of NT, said to me, &#147;Our goal is for you to set up your NT machine and <i>never reboot it</I>. If it crashes, if an application brings it down, then we haven&#146;t done our job.&#148; I have to admit that I smiled inwardly when Bob made that seemingly hubristic claim. But, as you&#146;ve already read, NT has achieved much of that goal; it&#146;s very stable.</P>
<p>(And when Bob says something, he&#146;s serious. When I called him for the interview we had scheduled, he told me, &#147;I&#146;m a little distracted; my wife&#146;s in the hospital getting ready to have our baby.&#148; I told him that it wasn&#146;t <i>exactly</I> necessary to do the interview at that moment, but he told me he was just waiting around for the birth anyway. Now, <i>there&#146;s</I> dedication to a job.&#133;)</P>
<p>But the point I&#146;m getting to is this: Windows 2000&#146;s stability comes with a price. Think of it this way. You have a choice between Windows 9<i>x</I> and Windows 2000 for your desktop operating system. Both are, as I&#146;ve already observed, pretty good, particularly when stacked up against their predecessors.</P>
<p>The defining criterion boils down to this: You can buy Windows 95 or 98 and get speed and massive compatibility; virtually all your DOS and Windows 3.1 applications will run with little or no tweaking on your part. But when Windows 9<i>x</I> crashes, you&#146;re out of luck. Or you can buy Windows 2000, which almost never crashes. It examines everything that an application wants to do before it allows the application to do it. When Windows 2000 <i>does</I> crash, it provides you with full disclosure of why the crash happened via the crash dump and the <tt>dumpexam.exe</TT> program. But the price of vigilance is performance; a computer running Excel under Windows 2000 will not run as quickly as that same computer running the same application under Windows 95.</P>
<p>You make the choice: speed and compatibility versus stability. Personally, I choose stability, but that&#146;s probably because I&#146;ve lost too many important files to unstable operating systems.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Some DOS and Windows 3.<i>x</I> Apps Run Slowly
</B></FONT></P>
<p>Because DOS and Windows 3.1 programs require watching (they&#146;re likely to do something that violates Windows 2000 security), Windows 2000 runs them at a noticeable speed disadvantage. If they&#146;re written &#147;clean,&#148; that is, if they attempt to use only the operating system to access the drive, video, mouse, and other devices, then Windows 2000 won&#146;t demonstrate much of a slowdown at all when compared to Windows 3.1 or DOS. But you&#146;ll have to test each program in turn.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Some DOS and Windows Apps Will Not Run</B></FONT></P>
<p>The next chapter discusses this in greater detail, but virtually all DOS and many Windows 3.1 applications bypass the operating system and directly manipulate the PC hardware.
</P>
<p>Windows 2000 can&#146;t allow this behavior, of course.</P>
<p>Rather than terminate those applications, Windows 2000 has a sneaky way of making them <i>think</I> they&#146;re directly accessing hardware. Windows 2000 uses a set of programs called VxDs, or virtual device drivers, which again are discussed more in the next chapter. Basically, a VxD exists for each device&#151;the keyboard, the mouse, the video board, and so on&#151;and it detects attempts by an application to access its companion hardware. The VxDs then swoop in and impersonate the hardware, leading the DOS or Windows 3.1 application to think that it actually <i>has</I> directly twiddled the hardware, making the application happy.</P>
<p>You do, of course, pay a price&#151;performance. As I said earlier, this can significantly slow down execution for a DOS or Windows 3.1 application. But, even worse, it may keep the application from running in the first place.</P>
<p>Here&#146;s why: When the designers of Windows 2000 built all Windows 2000&#146;s VxDs, they had to know what kinds of devices to build VxDs for in the first place. Most devices are easy; everybody has a keyboard, a mouse, and a video board. But what about the marginal stuff, like a proprietary scanner interface board, fax board, or possible factory control interface card? Microsoft figured that those were small markets and didn&#146;t try to write VxDs for those boards.</P>
<p>Now consider what happens when you run a DOS or Windows 3.1 program that was built to work with one of these &#147;unusual&#148; boards. Windows 2000 sees the program attempt to directly access some hardware for which Windows 2000 has no VxD. What should Windows 2000 do? Remember Windows 2000&#146;s middle name: security. Windows 2000&#146;s design says, &#147;When in doubt, leave it out,&#148; and so Windows 2000 must terminate the DOS program. Is this design feature good or bad? Well, remember your choice: fast and compatible versus stable.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>DOS and Windows Apps Don&#146;t Run Native on Non-x86 Machines</B></FONT></P>
<p>Although 90 percent of Windows 2000 users run Windows 2000 on Intel Pentiums, Pentium Pros, and Pentium IIs and IIIs, the rest run Windows 2000 on a RISC machine. RISC machines face two problems. First, not all Windows 2000 programs are recompiled and rebuilt to run on them. Just because you find a program for the Intel version of Windows 2000 doesn&#146;t mean that you&#146;ll find it implemented on the Intel IA64 chips.
</P>
<p>The second problem appears when a RISC-based Windows 2000 user tries to run a DOS or Windows 3.1 application. Because those applications are so numerous, Microsoft made sure that even RISC machines could run them&#151;but, truthfully, they don&#146;t run those programs very well. In order for a RISC machine to run DOS or Windows 3.1 programs, it must run an emulator program written by Insignia Systems, the maker of two programs familiar to Macintosh users, SoftPC and SoftWindows.</P><p><br></P>
