<h3><a name="Heading8"></A><font color="#000077">Windows 2000 Strengths for Non-Windows 2000 Users</FONT></H3>
<p>For those of you who have been using an operating system <i>other</I> than NT, the prospect of going to a whole new operating system is rightly scary. Although they are not the ultimate operating systems, Windows 95 and 98 aren&#146;t <i>bad</I> operating systems; why forgo them in favor of Windows 2000?</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading9"></A><font color="#000077">Stability</FONT></H4>
<p>Ever since his days at DEC and before that at DuPont, Dave Cutler had a simple formula for making sure that a piece of code was as bug free as possible: He forced the people who wrote the code to <i>use</I> the code. His phrase was that programmers should &#147;have to eat their own dog food.&#148; From as early as possible, it was Alpo for breakfast, Kenl-Ration for lunch, and Mighty Dog for dinner with the NT team. Putting a bug into the latest &#147;build&#148; of NT brought tons of peer disapproval and, worse, a <i>communication</I> from Dave.</P>
<p>Additionally, Cutler wrote some of the toughest pieces of the operating system himself. No one on the team just talked about what the system should do; everyone participated in building it. And Cutler carried all of NT in his head. Maybe this centralization was a <i>disadvantage</I>&#151;after all, what would happen when Cutler left the project? But at that time, having at least one person with the grand overview&#151;something that&#146;s rumored not to have existed for Windows 95&#151;was a great strength.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Looking at some of the bug lists that accompany the Service Pack updates for NT 4 is a worthwhile exercise. A Service Pack may fix hundreds of bugs, but those bugs could be so minor that not a single one applies to your installation. And consider that Service Packs were never released for DOS or Windows 3.1. One appeared for Windows 95, but it fixed only two bugs, leaving the dozens of shell bugs untouched. We can expect to see Service Packs for Windows 2000 too, so keep an eye on Microsoft&#146;s Web site from time to time.<hr></FONT>

<p>When Windows 2000 <i>does</I> die, it does a pretty good job of telling you who killed it. If you ever see Windows 2000 crash, you&#146;ll see a distinctive sight. The screen clears and goes to a 50-line text screen with a blue background and bright white letters. When Windows 2000 crashes, it fills up this blue screen&#151;Windows 2000 experts call this event <i>bluescreening</I>&#151;with memory dump information and an error message or two. In my experience, what kills Windows 2000 is a bad video driver, a bad disk driver, or a bad RAM chip, and the blue screen helps you identify which one is the culprit.</P>
<p>Furthermore, when Windows 2000 crashes, it writes an entire image of the physical memory to disk in what is called a <i>crash dump</I>. You can use the crash dump analysis program <tt>dumpexam.exe</TT> (included on the Windows 2000 installation CD) to look through the crash and narrow down the causes. You can also send the crash dumps to software and driver vendors, meaning that you have some leverage when you ask them to fix their software.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading10"></A><font color="#000077">No Limits on Speed</FONT></H4>
<p>One thing that can&#146;t be denied about NT is that it runs more slowly on a given system than Windows 9<i>x</I> or OS/2. At first glance, that conclusion would suggest that NT and speed aren&#146;t subjects you&#146;d often put in the same sentence. And if you&#146;re talking about the standard Pentium workstation with 16MB of RAM and a 100MHz processor, then it&#146;s true that you&#146;d be better off running most applications under Windows 9<i>x</I> than under NT 4.</P>
<p>But now consider the more powerful systems. The top end of the <i>x</I>86 world for a long time was the Pentium Pro processor, known as the <i>P6</I> in its infancy. And believe it or not, the Pro runs NT faster than it runs 95.</P>
<p>Why? Well, when Intel started designing the Pentium Pro in the late &#146;80s, it predicted that by 1995 most people would have converted from 16-bit to 32-bit operating systems. Consequently, Intel designed a CPU that ran fastest in 32-bit mode and not very fast in 16-bit mode; in fact, the Pentium Pro is usually slower than a Pentium in executing 16-bit code. Unfortunately, as we now know, Intel was a little optimistic in its beliefs about people&#146;s willingness to upgrade their operating systems. (The fact that memory prices didn&#146;t fall significantly until early 1996 certainly didn&#146;t help their willingness.) Hence, 16-bit operating systems, such as DOS or Windows 3.1, won&#146;t run very well on a Pentium Pro.</P>
<p>But what about Windows 95? Well, even though Windows 95 is advertised as being a 32-bit operating system, it&#146;s not, really. It combines a lot of the old 16-bit code with some new 32-bit code. In fact, a lot of Windows 95&#146;s 32-bit code is just 16-bit code with some programming fixes built in, a process called <i>thunking</I>. You won&#146;t find any such thunks in Windows 2000, because it&#146;s an actual 32-bit operating system. The upshot is, because Windows 95 is partially 16-bit, it takes a performance hit when running on a Pentium Pro.</P>
<p>Windows 2000, in contrast, gets <i>faster</I> on a Pentium Pro, because both use true 32-bit architecture. But the Windows 2000 speed boost doesn&#146;t end with the Pentium Pro. The new Pentium IIIs have that 32-bit architecture as well, and at the time of this writing they&#146;re running as fast as 600Mhz!</P>
<p>Yet another way to speed up a Windows 2000 machine is to use multiple processors. Windows 2000 Professional supports up to two processors. In theory, Windows 2000 can support up to 32 processors. You shouldn&#146;t have any trouble finding Pentium Pro, Pentium II, and Pentium III PCs that have space on the motherboard for up to four processors if you&#146;re running Windows 2000 Server.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Although Windows 2000 can support up to 32 processors, the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) that ships with Windows 2000 Professional supports only two processors. To use more, you&#146;ll need a custom HAL from your computer manufacturer. The HAL that ships with Windows 2000 Server supports four processors, and the higher versions of Windows 2000 Server support as many as 32 processors.<hr></FONT>

<p>The first desktop PC to run at 1000MHz won&#146;t be running Windows 9<i>x</I>&#151;it&#146;ll most likely be running Windows 2000. So, while the lower-end workstations run fastest with one of the old 16-bit or hybrid 16/32-bit operating systems, the more powerful machines will find Windows 2000 a better fit. And for an example of why a better fit is so &#147;absofragginlutely&#148; important, look at the section entitled &#147;Windows 2000 Is Capturing Several Markets&#148; (and the <i>absofragginlutely</I> will make more sense).</P><p><br></P>
