<p><font size="+1"><b>No Bookmark Support Exists for Applications</B></FONT></P>
<p>Ever since Macintosh and Windows appeared, they&#151;and subsequent graphical operating systems&#151;have used the paradigm of a desktop. The basic idea has probably been to get across the notion that you get real work done with a modern operating system, hence the desktop metaphor.
</P>
<p>The problem is, computer desktops don&#146;t resemble my physical desktop at all. For one thing, when I leave for the day, my desktop pretty much stays the way it is. If I leave my stapler in the middle of the desktop, it doesn&#146;t spirit itself off to the upper-left corner automatically.</P>
<p>For another thing, my &#147;data files&#148; and &#147;applications&#148; return each day to the place where I left them. Books open to page 45 are still at page 45 the next day; folders are open to the same sheet of paper. Half-finished drawings and my drawing tool (a pen) are waiting for my return.</P>
<p>Compare this real-life scenario to how Windows 2000 starts up in the morning. It remembers which folders you had open when you shut it down, and it re-opens them, but that&#146;s it. You must restart all the applications by hand, tell them what files they were working on (or, of course, you can double-click the files themselves), and, after the files and apps are loaded, you still have to tell the application to go back to where you were yesterday.</P>
<p>Why not build a bookmark programming interface that application vendors could put into their applications, an interface that could remember where you left off when last running the application or, perhaps, the file? Then every data file could contain a bookmark pointing to where it was last edited. (After all, virtually every application keeps track of where you are <i>while</I> you&#146;re running it; why not just save that information?) The Desktop would then only have to remember which data files you had open when you shut down. When the Desktop started up again, it would open the files, and their file associations would enable them to tell the Desktop which applications to start. Then the bookmark pointer would restore the application to exactly the state that existed when the computer powered down. One of these days, I guess &#133;</P>
<h3><a name="Heading24"></A><font color="#000077">Advice Before You Continue</FONT></H3>
<p>By now you&#146;ve read about the good news and the bad news in Windows 2000. On balance, Windows 2000 is the answer for many people and many applications, but not for all people. (You weren&#146;t expecting me to try to <i>tell</I> you what to do, were you?) Remember that the choice of either the Windows 9<i>x</I> or Windows 2000 path can&#146;t be a wrong one. If you haven&#146;t yet committed yourself, this section offers a few words of advice.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading25"></A><font color="#000077">Consult Microsoft&#146;s Hardware Compatibility List (HCL)</FONT></H4>
<p>Microsoft is in something of a tough spot when it comes to support. As a Microsoft VP once explained, &#147;There <i>is</I> no such thing as <i>PC-compatible</I>,&#148; meaning that every model has its own quirks. Because no two PCs are identical, building an operating system that will run on any PC is difficult for Microsoft (or anyone).</P>
<p>What Microsoft has done in response is to compile a list of machines that it has successfully tested and verified that Windows 2000 will run on. That list is called the Hardware Compatibility List, or HCL.</P>
<p>The HCL is a good idea but it has one problem: Getting on the list is expensive for a hardware vendor. A hardware vendor can&#146;t just give a computer to Microsoft to be tested for Windows 2000 compatibility; Microsoft charges thousands of dollars to test a computer. The result is that you can find many perfectly good computers made by small firms that can&#146;t afford to pay Microsoft to test their computers and so they never make it onto the HCL. If the computers don&#146;t make it onto the HCL, then choosing one of them is basically a crap shoot. The only way you&#146;ll know if Windows 2000 will run on the computer is to try and install it. At least with the HCL you can know ahead of time whether the computer will work.</P>
<p>Nevertheless, if you receive any kind of Microsoft product support for Windows 2000 (or if you <i>intend</I> to receive any kind of support), then you pretty much <i>have</I> to buy computers on the HCL. If you don&#146;t, then Microsoft technical support people &#147;get stupid&#148; all of a sudden. You can ask a perfectly valid question of a Microsoft technical support person, something like, &#147;What&#146;s the difference between a workgroup and a domain in Windows 2000?&#148; If the tech support person doesn&#146;t know the answer, he&#146;ll say, &#147;Well, that depends. What kind of computer are you running this on?&#148; If you answer, &#147;I&#146;ve got an Acme Thunderchip 586,&#148; he&#146;ll cluck his tongue and say, &#147;Well, that&#146;s not on the Hardware Compatibility List.&#148; Ah, yes, the HCL&#151;the last refuge of scoundrels.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you work for a large company that has Microsoft Premier Support, then you&#146;ve pretty much got to buy machines on the HCL. If you&#146;re part of a smaller company, then you <i>may</I> choose to save some money by buying cheaper machines whose firms opted not to give Microsoft money to test their machines&#151;but you&#146;re removing yourself from a source of later support. Last time I checked, Microsoft Technical Support policy states that if your <i>system</I> isn&#146;t on the HCL they can give you one hour and their best effort, or refund your money for the call and wish you luck.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>By the way, you can find the most up-to-date copy of the HCL (I think Microsoft updates it at least twice a month) on Microsoft&#146;s Web site, <a href="www.microsoft.com">www.microsoft.com</A>.</P><p><br></P>
