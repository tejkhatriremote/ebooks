<p><big><big>T</BIG></BIG>his chapter sets the stage for the remainder of the book. It&#146;s an in-depth look at the pros and the cons and the strengths and the weaknesses of Windows 2000 Professional, NT Workstation&#146;s latest release. The chapter starts with a little background, but gets into hardcore details regarding the internal workings of Windows 2000 very quickly.</P>
<p>Windows 2000 Professional has been a long time in the making. As is usually&#151;but not always&#151;the case with operating systems, Windows 2000 is an improvement over the older versions of NT Workstation; it&#146;s also quite different from NT Workstation&#146;s predecessors. And, besides their shared graphical user interface, Windows 2000 is also quite different in certain fundamental aspects from Windows 9<i>x</I>. Therefore, Windows 3.<i>x</I>, 9<i>x</I>, and NT veterans alike have lots of new things to learn.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">The Road to Windows 2000 Professional</FONT></H3>
<p>For many years people believed that microcomputer operating systems and mainframe operating systems were totally different entities, as different as bicycles and airliners. In the case of bikes and airliners, most of us would say &#147;Sure, they&#146;re both forms of transportation, but the similarity ends there.&#148; It&#146;s true. Microcomputer operating systems mainly ended up being launching pads for personal productivity tools such as word processors, drawing packages, e-mail, spreadsheets, and simple databases, as well as games. Mainframes, which make truly awful platforms for word processing (ask anyone who&#146;s ever tried to run the Unix version of WordPerfect or IBM&#146;s DisplayWrite/370), mainly ended up being the &#147;data warehouses&#148; of large corporations.
</P>
<p>Because mainframe systems generally operate in well-managed, centrally administered, and very fault-tolerant environments, huge mission-critical database programs have found a home on them. The IRS keeps its &#147;master file&#148; on every U.S. citizen in a building full of huge mainframes in Martinsburg, West Virginia. The IRS must run a program to examine the master file every day&#151;all 300+ million records of it&#151;and that file is so valuable that parts of it are backed up <i>continuously</I>. Running that application on a few dozen Pentium Pros under Windows is hard to imagine, isn&#146;t it? (Try explaining to the president that we weren&#146;t able to issue refunds this year because the master file GPF-ed.)</P>
<p>But think about it: Why <i>doesn&#146;t</I> the IRS do its work on PCs? PCs are slower than mainframes, certainly, but by a smaller and smaller margin with every machine generation. No, the main reason is that corporate information technology (IT) managers don&#146;t trust PC software, and with good reason. PC users assume and take for granted the existence of bugs in the software we buy. It&#146;s just a fact of computer life. Our acceptance is somewhat odd, though, when you think about it. Consistent low quality is almost unheard of in the rest of the manufacturing world. If one in a thousand Big Macs gave you food poisoning, would you still frequent McDonalds? Probably not. If automobiles have manufacturing defects, do you meekly accept the answer, &#147;Well, yes, it <i>is</I> a problem, but it&#146;s not a big one. We&#146;ll fix it in the next model.&#148; Nope. In fact, in most areas of commerce you usually don&#146;t need to worry about the issue of quality because laws protect consumers from shoddy products in most fields.</P>
<p>Why don&#146;t PC vendors work harder to produce high-quality, never-failing software? Well, some have; IBM&#146;s Personal Editor was one example of an essentially flawless piece of software. Operating systems haven&#146;t been quite as lucky, though; you&#146;d pretty much need a CD-ROM to hold the list of known Windows 3.<i>x</I> bugs.</P>
<p>With NT, however, Microsoft did something completely different, something pretty daring. Back in 1989, when it wasn&#146;t nearly as big a company as it is now and hadn&#146;t already sunk a <i>lot</I> of money into various operating systems projects, including ongoing work on MS-DOS, Xenix (a Unix variant), and OS/2, Microsoft developed its next-generation operating system in tandem with IBM. Additionally, Bill Gates and company were working on a hush-hush project to breathe new life into their Windows product, a project that would eventually become Windows 3.<i>x</I>. Surely <i>one</I> of those products would capture the hearts and minds of future PC users and assure Microsoft of a place on every desktop for the foreseeable future.</P><p><br></P>
