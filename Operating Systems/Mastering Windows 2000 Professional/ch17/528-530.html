<p><font size="+1"><b>Centralized Device Manager</B></FONT></P>
<p>The Windows 9<i>x</I> Plug-and-Play manager includes a tool called the Device Manager, and in my opinion it&#146;s the single greatest operating system advance in Windows 95.</P>
<p>The Device Manager is so very important because it moves device drivers and hardware support out of the Dark Ages and into the modern age. In the Dark Ages, every program needed its own graphics drivers. A DOS program such as 1-2-3 or WordPerfect 5.<i>x</I> could exploit a fancy video board only if it had a special 1-2-3 video driver or a WordPerfect video driver. The same was true for printers; for example, you might use 1-2-3 and WordPerfect for DOS but have a printer driver only for WordPerfect&#151;which creates a rather ridiculous situation wherein you could use your printer for one program but not for another.</P>
<p>The advent of advanced operating systems such as OS/2, Windows 3.1, and NT changed that situation because these operating systems all had shared display and printer drivers. Similarly, sound and network drivers meant that one driver offered sound and networking to all the operating system&#146;s programs.</P>
<p>But the drivers weren&#146;t <i>centralized</I>. No protocol kept the sound board&#146;s driver from using a resource that the network board&#146;s driver used. The reason for the potential chaos was that networking got attached to Windows 3.1 (or OS/2, for that matter) one piece at a time. Thus the drivers were never coordinated, making conflicts possible.</P>
<p>Windows 95 advanced the state of the art a bit by unifying all drivers, making them all register themselves with the Device Manager. For the first time in PC software, we actually have a program that can authoritatively provide a census of boards and the resources that the boards use.</P>
<p>Let me underscore the importance of this development. If you&#146;ve ever conducted hardware configuration or memory management under DOS, then you know the pain of going to a strange machine and finding out what boards are in the PC and identifying the memory addresses, I/O addresses, IRQ levels, and DMA channels that the boards use. Sure, programs such as Microsoft&#146;s MSD program or Quarterdeck&#146;s Manifest program help, but all they really do is <i>guess</I> which resources a board uses; that&#146;s right, they just guess. For example, one of the computers that I regularly use contains a video capture board, an Intel Smart Video Recorder Pro. It&#146;s a nice board but it comes with Windows 3.1 drivers only; there are no DOS drivers. Because MSD and Manifest are DOS programs, they have no way to detect the board, much less a way to detect which IRQ the board uses. But the Device Manager puts an end to all that guesswork.</P>
<p>Device Manager is a great tool, and one that NT users will appreciate in Windows 2000. What&#146;s more, the Device Manager in Windows 2000 is just one part of a comprehensive Hardware Wizard that will aid in installing, configuring, and troubleshooting all of your hardware devices.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading18"></A><font color="#000077">Power Management</FONT></H4>
<p>Running NT 4 on my laptop looked familiar, as I&#146;ve used Windows 95 for some time. But something was missing, and it took me a little while to figure out that it was the little battery icon on the Taskbar.
</P>
<p>NT 4 didn&#146;t have any kind of Advanced Power Management (APM) support, but Windows 2000 does. This is one of the new features that will make it much easier to run this operating system on portable computers. In fact, I&#146;m writing this section on my Dell Inspiron 7000, watching my battery meter very carefully.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading19"></A><font color="#000077">Windows 2000 Weaknesses</FONT></H3>
<p>Ah, but Windows 2000 is not all wine and roses. Windows 2000 isn&#146;t right for everybody, at least not yet. Windows 2000 problems tend to fall into one of several categories:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>Problems related to scale</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some problems stem from the fact that a lot fewer people are using NT than are using Windows or DOS. As a result, fewer people are writing applications and drivers for NT.
<dd><b>Problems related to expectations</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Other problems come from people&#146;s prior knowledge of Windows or Windows 9<i>x</I>. People expect Windows 2000 to have all the features of whatever operating system they already know, and Windows 2000 doesn&#146;t always comply with that expectation.
<dd><b>Problems related to Windows 2000 security</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 2000&#146;s middle name, security, gets it into trouble. Deciding to secure an operating system means that you can lock yourself out of your own computer. Believe it or not, it&#146;s actually possible to lock Windows 2000 out of itself!
<dd><b>Problems related to Windows 2000&#146;s legacy</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It inherits some unpleasant characteristics from earlier operating systems.
<dd><b>Problems that aren&#146;t really problems</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, some of Windows 2000&#146;s &#147;problems&#148; are really shortcomings, things that it <i>should</I> be doing, but hasn&#146;t gotten to yet.
