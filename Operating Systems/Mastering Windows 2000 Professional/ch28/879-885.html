<p><font size="+1"><b>Auditing</B></FONT></P>
<p>Click the Advanced button to open the Access Control Settings dialog, then click the Auditing tab to display the Auditing Entries dialog box (shown in Figure 28.3), where you can keep track of who has accessed a file and when.
</P>

<p>When auditing a file, you first need to select the individual user or the group that you want to keep track of.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you want to keep general information on who has accessed a file, select the group called Everyone and audit this group&#146;s access to the file.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<table border="2" bordercolor="#0000" align="CENTER">
<tr><td><font size="+1"><b>Turning Auditing On</B></FONT>
<p>In order for auditing to work, you need to turn on the auditing feature from the Computer Management console. Follow these steps:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open Administrative Tools in Control Panel, and double-click Local Security Policy.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Expand the Local Policies entry in the console and select Audit Policy.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Double-click the policy items you want to change to open their Properties dialog, then click either Success or Failure (or both) as the type of event to audit.
</DL>
<p>You can choose whether to audit the successes and/or failures. However, you cannot audit the successful file access unless you are also auditing the successful Object Access.
</P>
</TABLE>

<p>After selecting the users whom you want to audit, you specify what you want to audit&#151;reads of the file, writes to the file, attempts to execute the file (if it is an <tt>.exe</TT> or <tt>.com</TT> file), and the like. You can audit either the successful or failed attempts to do the above, or both, because you can select these options separately.</P>
<p>Any events that you choose to audit will be placed in the Security log, which is part of the Event log. You can view these events from Administrative Tools <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch28/images/28-01i.jpg"> Event Viewer.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Ownership</B></FONT></P>
<p>You can take ownership of a file as you can with any other resource in NT Workstation. To take ownership of a file, you must have the permission to do so. You would either have Full Control permission, or Special Access permissions which give you the permission to take ownership. When you take ownership, you will see the Owner dialog box shown in Figure 28.4.
</P>
<p><a name="Fig4"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch28/images/28-04.jpg',485,443)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch28/images/28-04t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch28/images/28-04.jpg',485,443)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 28.4</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Owner tab lets you take ownership for a file or folder.</P>
<p>Remember, taking ownership of a file enables you to do anything you want with the file, no matter what your permissions are for that file.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading7"></A><font color="#000077">Summary</FONT></H4>
<p>The Summary tab is new in Windows 2000. This tab, shown in Figure 28.5, contains information on the file, such as a title, revision, and category.
</P>
<p><a name="Fig5"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch28/images/28-05.jpg',370,461)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch28/images/28-05t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch28/images/28-05.jpg',370,461)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 28.5</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Summary tab contains information that distinguishes the file.</P>
<p>This information is more specific to documents, usually. A Word document, for example, would have a title and subject assigned to it, as well as a revision number, author, and more. This Summary of the document would server to fully distinguish the document from other documents in the same folder. Having the Summary tab for an executable file is less useful, but developers may begin to include information in their programs that will be displayed here.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading8"></A><font color="#000077">Program</FONT></H4>
<p>The Program tab confirms the paths to the file, as you can see in Figure 28.6.
</P>
<p><a name="Fig6"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch28/images/28-06.jpg',367,443)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch28/images/28-06t.jpg"></A>

<p>At the top is the full name of the application. Because the full name doesn&#146;t appear in the folder or at the top of the application window when it&#146;s running, there&#146;s little point in adjusting it. The next entries, however, are worth exploring:
</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Cmd Line</B>
<dd>Indicates the name of the executable file for the program. If you change this entry, you won&#146;t be able to run the program. Windows 2000 will automatically update this entry if you move a file, but be aware that not all programs will run from just any folder&#151;homebodies, like Lotus 1-2-3, insist on being in their own program directories. A lot of DOS applications will work just fine if you provide the path in the form of a UNC. If you choose to go this route because the application is located somewhere on the network, please test the launching of the application; some DOS apps work fine with UNCs, and others do not like it at all.
<dt><b>Working</B>
<dd>Indicates the directory where the application will go first to load and save data files. If you don&#146;t enter anything here, the application will look first in its program directory. You can enter any drive or directory here, so if you store all your files in your home directory on the server, you can enter the directory information here.
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>When specifying a working directory, make sure that directory will be available. If you specify a network directory (for example) and the network is not active, you&#146;ll slow your application as it tries to connect to the unavailable directory.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<dt><b>Batch File</B>
<dd>Enables you to specify a batch file to be run each time you start up the application. For example, the DOS disk copying program DCOPY won&#146;t work unless you specify a source drive in the Startup command. Double-click the icon, and all you&#146;ll get is a nastygram with instructions telling you how to start the program and the Help file. Therefore, to make this program work in Windows 2000, you must type <b>DCOPY A</B> in the Batch File box. From there, the program works as though you&#146;d typed DCOPY A from the command line.
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Make sure that you include the full path information if the batch file is not in the same directory as the program file.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<dt><b>Shortcut Key</B>
<dd>Indicates a hotkey combination that enables you to start up an application without having to pull it from its folder or the toolbar. Shortcut keys must include Ctrl or Alt (for example, Ctrl&#43;J) and cannot conflict with any other shortcut keys, including Windows 2000 combinations, or they won&#146;t work. You cannot use the Tab, Esc, Enter, spacebar, Backspace, or Print Screen keys in a shortcut key.
<dt><b>Run</B>
<dd>Specifies how the program should run: as a window, full screen (maximized), or minimized on the Desktop. Not all programs can run as a full screen, so the default Normal window option may be your best bet.
<dt><b>Close On Exit</B>
<dd>Enables you to close the DOS windows when the application finishes running. This option is a good choice for most cases. However, at times you may be running a utility such as MEM, when you want to see the results of the MEM statement. The MEM statement takes only half a second to run, and when it is finished running it closes the DOS window behind it, so you don&#146;t have enough time to view the result. To alleviate this problem, deselect Close on Exit, and the result will be put in an inactive DOS window&#151;which means that the computer will take a snapshot of the final 25 lines of the MEM statement and hold it in a window for you to look at. When you are finished viewing the DOS window, simply close the window.
</DL>

<p>In addition to the main window, the Program tab is the starting point for a couple of advanced program settings: changing the program icon and setting the <tt>autoexec.bat</TT> and <tt>config.sys</TT> for this DOS session.</P><p><br></P>
