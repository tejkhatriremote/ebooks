<p><font size="+1"><b>Idle Sensitivity</B></FONT></P>
<p>Idle Sensitivity affects the length of time that a DOS application must be idle before some of its CPU cycles are allocated elsewhere. The higher the setting, the sooner an application will lose CPU cycles, although it will not lose all of them unless Always Suspend is checked.
</P>
<p>Adjusting this setting can make DOS multitasking smoother. A simple multitasking system would perform basic <i>time slicing</I>, a process whereby <i>X</I> percent of the time goes to program 1, <i>Y</I> percent to program 2, and so on. But we can do better than that. It turns out that DOS programs tend to have one thing in common: They&#146;re interactive. As we said a minute ago, an application spends a lot of time waiting for input.</P>
<p>So if three programs are running and two are basically waiting for input, then Windows 2000 should give all the CPU time to the one program that <i>isn&#146;t</I> waiting for input. The only problem is figuring out which programs are waiting for keyboard input. This process is not an exact science, so Windows 2000 has some rules of thumb that it uses to guess which programs are waiting for input and which aren&#146;t. Try fiddling with these settings to help Windows 2000 use its rules. Depending on where you set the slider, Windows 2000 will temporarily shut down any program needing input, automatically reactivating that program when you next give it a keystroke.</P>
<p>The downside (you knew there&#146;d be one) is that it takes some time for Windows 2000 Professional to monitor a program for inactivity, and that time may really slow down a program. So adjust each program&#146;s PIF to the length of idle time that you&#146;re willing to allow, but if the system seems slow, move the slider down so that more idle time is permitted. (Moving a slider <i>down</I> to get <i>more</I> of something seems counterintuitive, but then, do you turn air conditioning <i>up</I> or <i>down</I> to get colder air?) Idle sensitivity is just one of a number of PIF options that really requires some experimentation to get just right.</P>
<p>Here are some programs for which you should probably set the idle sensitivity as low as possible:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Background communications
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Background printing
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;3270 emulation
</DL>
<p>Once again, if you find that an application is not getting enough resources to work in the background, adjust the setting downward.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Mouse</B></FONT></P>
<p>You can adjust how the mouse works with DOS applications in two ways:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Permit the user to select text for copying and cutting without using the Mark Text tool in the DOS toolbar (which is a viable option only if you turn on the toolbar under the Appearance properties page).
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Restrict the mouse to just the active DOS application.
</DL>
<p>Activating QuickEdit means that you can select data within the DOS window without needing to mark it. From there, you can copy the data to another application or to Notepad. You can still copy data from an application without QuickEdit activated, but to do so, you must first click the Mark button (a rectangle with a dotted border) so you can select the data to be copied. QuickEdit saves you a step.
</P>
<p>If you set the mouse to Exclusive Mode, you can get the mouse back for Windows 2000 use by pressing Alt&#43;Tab or Alt&#43;Esc to cycle to another application. However, you can use the mouse only while in that active application. Move the mouse from the window and the cursor disappears.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Termination</B></FONT></P>
<p>Warn If Still Active alerts you that a DOS program is still running if you attempt to close a DOS window without first exiting the program running in that window. Try it, and you&#146;ll see the following warning.
</P>
<p><a name="Fig14"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch28/images/28-14.jpg',354,243)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch28/images/28-14t.jpg"></A></P>
<p>You might as well keep this option enabled (it is by default) because Windows 2000 Professional won&#146;t prevent you from closing the window without exiting first, but only warns you that doing so could cause problems.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Other</B></FONT></P>
<p>You know that Windows 2000 didn&#146;t know how to categorize something when you see it in the Other box in the Misc tab. Fast Pasting refers to how data can be pasted from the Clipboard. With this option enabled, if you have data in the Clipboard, you can paste it into your application just as if it were an NT app&#151;maybe.
</P>
<p>If you select the Fast Pasting check box, the application will paste information as quickly as Windows 2000 can transfer the data. Because some applications cannot paste properly using this method, test it before relying on it&#151;try to paste information from the Clipboard to the application. If the paste is successful, you can use the option.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Windows Shortcut Keys</B></FONT></P>
<p>If you uncheck any of these shortcut key combinations, then you&#146;re telling Windows 2000 to ignore them and reserve them for the use of that particular DOS application. You can&#146;t use this dialog box to assign new shortcut keys to an application. This dialog box is for helping you get full functionality from programs designed before Windows took over some key combinations.
</P>
<h3><a name="Heading13"></A><font color="#000077">Managing DOS Memory under Windows 2000</FONT></H3>
<p>DOS memory management under Windows 2000 Professional isn&#146;t very different from DOS memory management under DOS. Keep the number of programs loaded in conventional memory to a minimum, load DOS high, and that should prevent many memory problems.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading14"></A><font color="#000077">Maximizing Conventional Memory</FONT></H4>
<p>DOS can see only the lowest 640K of memory, so if you&#146;re running a DOS program you&#146;re going to want to squeeze all the good from that 640K that you can. And that means that you want as much of that memory free as possible.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Load Fewer Programs (TSRs and Device Drivers)</B></FONT></P>
<p>The first step in maximizing conventional memory has been done for you in Windows 2000 Professional. Rather than relying on external device drivers (like the one controlling your mouse) that must use part of the lowest 640K, Windows 2000 includes 32-bit device drivers in the operating system that can reside in memory above 640K, thus freeing up conventional memory. You can follow in that tradition by not loading TSRs unless you really need them.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Load DOS High</B></FONT></P>
<p>By default, another step for maximizing conventional memory has already been done for you as well. If you turn to the Program tab in a DOS program&#146;s Properties dialog box, you&#146;ll notice that, by default, DOS is loaded high so that most of it isn&#146;t cluttering up conventional memory.
