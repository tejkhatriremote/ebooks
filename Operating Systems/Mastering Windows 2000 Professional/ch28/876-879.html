<h3><a name="Heading4"></A><font color="#000077">Setting the Properties of DOS Apps</FONT></H3>
<p>Windows 2000 Professional can run your DOS applications and in many cases can run them better than DOS can: You can multitask, context-switch, and isolate them from other applications that are running in Windows 2000. Additionally, you can load and unload Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) programs without having to reboot. Just close the window, and the TSR leaves memory-a nice feature for those terribly useful DOS TSRs that you&#146;ve been using forever and don&#146;t want to give up but don&#146;t want hanging around in memory either.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Many TSR programs will not run in Windows 2000. You may have to test your TSR programs to find out which ones will operate normally in Windows 2000.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Windows 3.<i>x</I> required a certain amount of hand-tuning, using a tool called the <i>PIF Editor,</I> to get these DOS applications to work. The PIF Editor, or program information file editor, was where you&#146;d set environment variables such as the amount and kind of memory the application received, whether it ran in a window or full screen, and what fonts it used.</P>
<p>Windows 2000 Professional does not have a PIF Editor. Instead, the job of the PIF Editor is handled by the Properties dialog boxes associated with every DOS application. Using the Properties boxes is a little simpler than using the PIF Editor because they are broken into smaller chunks and don&#146;t provide all the options that the PIF Editor does. Generally speaking, however, both functions fine-tune DOS applications.</P>
<p>To open the Properties dialog box, right-click an application&#146;s object (in Figure 28.1, we&#146;ve chosen <tt>command.com</TT>) and choose Properties from the pop-up menu. Figure 28.1 shows the opening window of the <tt>command.com</TT> Properties dialog box.</P>

<p>Please note that only DOS applications will have such detailed Properties dialog boxes; Windows 2000 applications will have only a General tab and a Version tab.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The Properties sheets will also contain a Security tab if the file is stored on an NTFS partition.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Be careful when editing the contents of a program&#146;s Properties dialog box. It doesn&#146;t have a Restore Defaults button.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>To illustrate the function of each Properties tab, we will go through them one by one with a sample program&#151;<tt>command.com</TT>.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading5"></A><font color="#000077">General</FONT></H4>
<p>The opening window in the Properties dialog box (shown in Figure 28.1) gives you some general information about the application, including:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The filename and type
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Which folder the file is located in
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the file on the hard disk
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the file has been compressed
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The date the file was created (if you installed the program after installing Windows 2000), last modified, and last accessed
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The attributes associated with the file
</DL>
<p>When you install a DOS application, Windows 2000 does a lot of the preliminary work; so when you open this screen, the file and folder information will already be in place and you won&#146;t be able to edit it. You don&#146;t have to do much here except perhaps note the file size (remembering that this number is the space that the file requires on disk, not the amount of memory it needs to run) and adjust the attributes as necessary. For example, if you want to make sure that the program file gets backed up the next time you back up your disk, you can set the archive bit.
</P>
<p>The Windows 2000 Resource Kit warns you in rather dire terms not to adjust the file attributes, but the only thing that you really need to worry about is hiding the file (setting the hidden bit) and then not being able to find it. Otherwise, you can&#146;t do very much damage. To help with this idea, Windows 2000 has moved the other attributes to an Advanced dialog box that you reach by clicking the Advanced button on the General tab. The only attributes available on the General tab are Read Only and Hidden.</P>
<p>The Advanced dialog contains some more interesting information. The Archive and Index Attributes section of the dialog box enables you to tell Windows 2000 if the file is ready for archiving, or if it has been modified since the last time it was backed up to tape. It also lets you specify that the file will be included in the scan performed by the Indexing Service in order to perform faster file searches.</P>
<p>The Compress or Encrypt Attributes section enables you to compress the file or folder by checking the box, or to encrypt the file for extra security.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading6"></A><font color="#000077">Security</FONT></H4>
<p>The Security tab in the <tt>command.com</TT> Properties dialog box has really changed in Windows 2000. What used to be a tab containing three buttons in NT 4 has become an easy-to-use dialog box for adding, removing, and modifying file permissions.</P>
<p>The first sight that greets you on the Security tab is a list of the users and groups that have been granted permissions to the file. The lower list box gives you a list of the permissions for the group or user that you have highlighted in the upper list box. This dialog box gives you an easy way to assign permissions, but if you want to get more granular in the permissions, or if you want to set up auditing or change the ownership of the file, you&#146;ll need to press the Advanced button at the bottom of the dialog box, as shown in Figure 28.2.</P>
