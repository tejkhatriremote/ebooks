<p>The application&#146;s screen settings determine how it will look while running and how memory is allocated to drawing the screens used. Look at Figure 28.11 to see how Windows 2000 sets up <tt>command.com</TT>&#146;s appearance on one machine.</P>

</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Full Screen or Window</B></FONT></P>
<p>You can make several choices on the Screen page. First, you need to decide whether to run the application as a full-screen or a window. Depending on the application, you may not have a choice; some applications, especially very graphically oriented ones using EGA or VGA, insist on their full screen. Some applications will let you <i>set</I> them to run in a window, but as soon as the program begins they revert to a full screen.</P>
<p>If you run the program in a window, you can set its size beforehand. If you preset the window size, you can&#146;t resize it while the DOS session is running.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Window Appearance</B></FONT></P>
<p>In this section, you can use the Restore Settings on Startup parameter to determine whether all the appearance parameters that you&#146;ve set&#151;the font, window size, and window position&#151;will be used the next time that you start the program.
</P>
<p>Oddly enough, although these two settings apply only if you&#146;re running the program in a window, they&#146;re not grayed out even if Full Screen is selected.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Performance</B></FONT></P>
<p>You have two options for fine-tuning the performance of your application: Fast ROM Emulation and Dynamic Memory Allocation.
</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Fast ROM Emulation</B>
<dd>Windows 2000 Professional contains some programs that perform the function of some of the BIOS routines found in your system ROM (such as display and keyboard controls). These programs often work better than the hardwired BIOS, but unless you tell DOS programs to use them, they&#146;ll consult the instructions found in the BIOS. Enabling Fast ROM Emulation causes the program to write to the screen faster because the system will use the more efficient video-display routines in Windows 2000 rather than the ones in your system&#146;s BIOS. For most applications, you won&#146;t see a noticeable difference when you enable this option, but Windows 2000 does suggest that you leave it enabled unless your application uses nonstandard ROM functions or you&#146;re having problems getting the application to write to the screen. For most applications, however, ROM emulation should present no problems.
<dt><b>Dynamic Memory Allocation</B>
<dd>Some DOS applications have both text and graphics modes; one example is WordPerfect 5.1, which runs in text mode until you preview a print job and then it switches to graphics mode. Graphics mode requires more video memory than text mode. To allocate video memory to an application only as it&#146;s needed, click Dynamic Memory Allocation, and Windows 2000 will supply the program with only as much video memory as it needs, leaving any extra for other programs. If you select this option, when an application switches from text mode to graphics mode, Windows 2000 will attempt to allocate more video memory to the application. If not enough video memory is available, then Windows 2000 won&#146;t be able to run the program in graphics mode, and you may not be able to see your print preview, for example. Therefore, if you want to be sure that your program will work no matter what mode it&#146;s in, make sure that this box is <i>not</I> checked.
</DL>

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading12"></A><font color="#000077">Miscellaneous Settings</FONT></H4>
<p>Clicking the Misc tab displays a dialog that looks like Figure 28.12.
</P>
<p><a name="Fig13"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch28/images/28-13.jpg',370,461)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch28/images/28-13t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch28/images/28-13.jpg',370,461)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 28.12</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Misc tab in the Properties dialog box</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Foreground</B></FONT></P>
<p>If you check the Allow Screen Saver box (active by default), then the screen saver you chose in the Display section of the Control Panel will come up if you haven&#146;t put anything into the system for a predetermined length of time.
</P>
<p>Windowed and full-screen DOS applications recover from the screen saver somewhat differently. When you return to the screen by moving the mouse, a windowed application will be in the place you left it. If a full-screen application was active when the screen saver came up, however, then when you move the mouse to retire the screen saver, you&#146;ll be back at Windows 2000&#146;s Desktop with the application minimized in the toolbar. Click the application&#146;s button on the toolbar to return to the application.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Background</B></FONT></P>
<p>If you click Always Suspend, Windows 2000 will cease the operation of the DOS application when it&#146;s in the background. For example, if you&#146;re calculating a spreadsheet in Excel and then fire up a DOS game like Warlords to while away the weary hours while the spreadsheet&#146;s assembling, then the spreadsheet will stop while you&#146;re playing Warlords.
</P>
<p>This may seem like a bad thing, but an awful lot of programs don&#146;t do anything when they&#146;re in the background; they sit, waiting for some input from you. For example, if you&#146;re working in a word processor, most of the time the system&#146;s waiting for you, even if you&#146;re a fast typist. (The only computer that we&#146;ve ever seen that couldn&#146;t keep up with a fairly speedy typist was an old computerized engraver that was something of a relic even in 1988, and comparing it to modern computers is like comparing a moped to the Concorde.) Even if a program isn&#146;t doing anything except waiting, however, it&#146;s still using up CPU cycles.</P>
<p>To get the most out of your CPU&#146;s time, therefore, Windows 2000 can keep the program in a state of suspended animation until you express an interest in seeing it again. If you don&#146;t want Windows 2000 to do this with one of your programs (such as that spreadsheet), then make sure that Always Suspend is not selected. This setting affects only the program whose properties you are adjusting.</P>
<p>Note that the Exclusive setting in the Windows 3.<i>x</I> PIF Editor is not part of Windows 2000. If you want a DOS program to get all the resources allocated to DOS programs when it&#146;s in the foreground, you&#146;ll have to check the Always Suspend option for every other program that is open at the same time.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you&#146;re accustomed to working with Windows 3.<i>x</I>&#146;s PIF Editor, be careful with this setting. Under 3.<i>x</I>, selecting Background meant that the program <i>would</I> run in the background; under Windows 2000, it means that it <i>won&#146;t</I>.<hr></FONT>
