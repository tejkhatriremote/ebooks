<p><font size="+1"><b>Creating Striped and Spanned Volumes</B></FONT></P>
<p>Windows 2000 can create large volumes that span several hard drives, which can be useful if you work with large amounts of data. Windows 2000 can also create a <i>striped volume</I>, which consists of two or more disks &#147;striped&#148; together; stripe sets enable you to access large data files faster. In other words, when you tell an application to write to disk, data is written to all disks in the stripe set simultaneously, with each one receiving part of the file. The result is faster throughput for both reads and writes, although your hardware costs increase and you don&#146;t effectively add to your storage capacity.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>You may have heard the term RAID, which stands for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks. RAID technology is usually used only on servers that process a great deal of data or that get many data requests from many users. There are different RAID levels, and each has its benefits and liabilities. The Windows 2000 striped volume is considered RAID 0&#151;data is striped across at least two drives. The benefit is increased performance. The liability is added risk: If one of the drives fails, the <i>entire</I> volume will be lost if it hasn&#146;t been backed up. Also, most file servers have hardware RAID disk controllers, but Windows 2000&#146;s implementation of RAID 0 is done in &#147;software.&#148; Your CPU, therefore, has to do the work of splitting and reassembling files that are read from or written to the striped volume.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Disk striping is the fastest partitioning scheme available in Windows 2000. It can use either FAT or NTFS but cannot contain the system or boot partition. In addition, in Windows 2000, striped volumes can only be created on dynamic disks.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Windows 2000 can also create a <i>spanned volume</I>, which groups several formatted disks to create a single, larger volume that Windows 2000 sees as one unit. This technique is more commonly known as <i>spanning</I> of disks, or parts of disks. For example it offers the advantage of letting you create a single, very large data drive for general storage rather than having to use each drive individually. Here&#146;s how to create a volume set:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The drives or drive parts you&#146;re including should contain no partition information. They should read Free Space.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold down the Ctrl key and select the drives or parts of drives you want to include in the new volume set.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, from the Action menu, chose Create Volume Set.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 2000 asks for the volume set size. If you decide you want the size to be less than the sum total of the included drives, Windows 2000 will try to distribute the volume set evenly across its member drives.
<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;To format the new volume set partition, from the Partition menu, select Commit Changes Now.
<dd><b>6.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, select the volume set and right-click it&#151;or click the Action menu&#151;and select Format. Windows 2000 prompts for which file system you&#146;d like to use. Select NTFS and leave the QuickFormat box unchecked. Windows 2000 now formats the new volume set. Depending on the volume set size, this process may take some time.
<dd><b>7.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;To save these new changes to your configuration, run the Windows Backup utility to create a new ERD.
</DL>
<p>Creating a striped volume is similar to creating a spanned volume, but there is a consideration: If you dual-boot your system, you won&#146;t be able to see this striped volume when running Windows 3.1 or Windows 9<i>x</I>. Here&#146;s how to create a striped volume:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The drives or drive parts you&#146;re including should contain no partition information. They should read Free Space.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold down the Ctrl key and select the drives or parts of drives you want to include in the new striped volume.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, from the Action menu, choose Create Striped Volume.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 2000 asks for the striped volume size. If you decide you want the striped volume size to be less than the sum total of the included drives, Windows 2000 will try to distribute the striped volume evenly across its member drives.
<dd><b>6.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, select the striped volume and right-click it&#151;or click the Action menu&#151;and select Format. Windows 2000 asks which file system you&#146;d like to use. Select NTFS and leave the QuickFormat box unchecked. Windows 2000 will now format the new striped volume. Depending on the striped volume size, this process may take some time.
<dd><b>7.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;To save these new changes to your configuration, run the Windows Backup utility and create a new ERD.
</DL>

<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>A Windows 2000 striped volume is non-fault-tolerant: If one drive goes south, the whole stripe set is history. Be sure to back up stripe sets regularly.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Using Dynamic Volumes</B></FONT></P>
<p>Dynamic volumes are a new concept in Windows 2000. Traditional partition types stored their information in a <i>partition table</I> that was located in the first physical sector of the hard disk. It was this location, and its limited storage space for partition information, that limited us to four partitions per physical disk. The partition table stores information for the size and location of each partition, and is used to find the bootable partition during the startup procedure.</P>
<p>Dynamic volumes store their partition information in the data portion of the drive, and thus they are not limited in the amount of information they can store. To convert a basic disk to a dynamic disk, right-click the disk in the Disk Management tool and select Upgrade to Dynamic Disk from the context menu. You will have to reboot to perform the conversion. After the restart, you will be able to create or modify dynamic volumes on the disk, including expanding the volume across multiple disks. Figure 30.3 shows the Create Volume Wizard that will walk you through the process of creating a new volume on a dynamic disk.</P>
