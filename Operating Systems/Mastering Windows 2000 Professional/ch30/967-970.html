<p>Upon opening Event Viewer, you&#146;d see an Error event in the System log reported by Windows 2000&#146;s Service Control Manager. After clicking it, you&#146;d see the message &#147;The following boot-start or system-start driver(s) failed to load: sndblst.&#148; Although this somewhat terse message doesn&#146;t provide any specifics, from Event Viewer, you could then check your Sound Blaster driver&#146;s status in Control Panel. To do so, open the Control Panel, open the System applet and click the Hardware tab, then click the Device Manager button, and bring up the properties sheet for the SoundBlaster to check the settings.
</P>
<p>Event Viewer has a few other handy features to check out.</P>
<p>From the Log menu, in addition to changing Log views, you can clear all events from all three logs. Be careful here, however. Although Windows 2000 will issue a warning, there&#146;s no Undo for clearing the logs. If you think you want to access event information contained in the logs, save them as backups in a different subfolder so that you can access them later if need be.</P>
<p>You can tweak your log settings for all three logs, changing log size to be anywhere from 64KB on up (the default is 512KB) in the Maximum Log Size box in the Log Properties. You can also change the overwrite settings in the System Log Properties dialog box (see Figure 30.7). Windows 2000 defaults to overwriting events more than seven days old; so if your network administrator wants to back up your event logs weekly, all events will be catalogued. This can pose a problem only if your system is generating an unusually large amount of log events&#151;for example, an application or device isn&#146;t working properly, or a network protocol stack is continuously issuing warning events.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you&#146;ve set event overwriting to be cleared manually or have specified to overwrite events of a certain age, the Windows 2000 System log can fill up and can no longer be updated until you make more room in the log. If your system is having problems and can&#146;t update the System log, diagnosing a problem may be more difficult. If your log file has filled, you can&#146;t re-enable event logging by increasing the logs&#146; file sizes. You&#146;ll have to back up your logs, clear all events from them, and then increase the files&#146; sizes.<hr></FONT>

If you&#146;re concerned about being able to track events over a period of time, increase the file size of each log.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Be careful to watch the size of logs as they grow. If you have set the logs to never overwrite and they fill up, 2000 may hang. If you are auditing for security events, the recommended setting is to never overwrite because security events should be documented over long periods of time. Clearing and archiving the log should be a part of routine maintenance.<hr></FONT>

<p>Using the View menu in Event Viewer, you can sort events chronologically, listing either the oldest or the newest events first. Also, you can find a specific event using Event Viewer&#146;s search engine. This feature essentially duplicates the Filter Events function, except that Event Viewer&#146;s search engine will display, one by one events, that fit a certain description rather than listing them all at once.
</P>

<p>You can get details about a specific event by selecting Details from the View menu, although it&#146;s probably easier to simply select the event and press Enter. Selecting Refresh updates the log you&#146;re currently viewing. When you first launch Event Viewer, all three logs are updated. The log you&#146;re viewing will not be updated, however, unless you select Refresh or view one of the other three logs. If you&#146;re looking for a certain recent event and don&#146;t see it, choose Refresh to see if it has been entered into the log you&#146;re viewing.
</P>
<p>Using the General tab of the Log Properties dialog box, you can enable the Low Speed Connection feature if you&#146;re getting Event Log information about other computers (or they&#146;re getting Event Log information about your computer) on your network and if you are connected to that network via a modem.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading7"></A><font color="#000077">Running the Performance Management Console</FONT></H3>
<p>Windows 2000 is designed to &#147;self-tune&#148; for optimal performance but also provides several tools for detecting possible performance bottlenecks. You can use the Windows 2000 Performance console to monitor and log the performance of hundreds of variables, including some very esoteric ones intended to be used by developers and network administrators when tracking application and system behavior. In addition to tracking performance on your system, you can track performance counters on other Windows 2000 machines on your network. We&#146;ll take a look at the Performance console and some of its components. Rather than cover every variable counter you can assign in Performance, we&#146;ll look at about a dozen or so key counters that deliver the most relevant system information. If you really want to dig deep into the more obscure performance variables that Performance can track, it gives you a brief description of what each function does.

<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you want only a quick read on Windows 2000 &#147;vitals,&#148; right-click the Taskbar and select Task Manager. Though not new to Windows 2000, Task Manager has many added features, including a Performance tab that reports CPU usage and memory statistics. Task Manager also lists applications you have open, as well as processes that are running (those created by programs and Windows 2000 services). Task Manager is discussed in detail in the &#147;Running Task Manager&#148; section at the end of this chapter.<hr></FONT>

<p>To launch Performance, click Start, select Programs <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-11i.jpg"> Administrative Tools, and click the Performance icon. Windows 2000 displays the Performance window, as shown in Figure 30.8.</P>
