<p>You may remember Device Manager from Windows 98. Windows 2000 has a Device Manager that is almost exactly the same, except that is uses the new Microsoft Management Console (MMC) as its interface. We&#146;ll take a look at the types of information that can be retrieved through Device Manager, and how you can modify some system resources through this tool.

<p>The Windows 2000 Event Viewer is often a good starting place when your system is having problems, because most errors are recorded in the System log. And although Event Viewer&#146;s messages are often terse, they may indicate where to look next.
</P>
<p>Dr. Watson is an application that by default doesn&#146;t have an icon or a clickable shortcut. And like a certain famous British detective&#146;s sidekick, Dr. Watson can sometimes provide useful information. Dr. Watson is an application debugger, which is a tool that monitors application activity. If an application crashes, Dr. Watson diagnoses the error and writes the diagnostic information to the <tt>drwatson.log</TT> file in the <tt>Winnt</TT> subfolder. Though the information that Dr. Watson logs tends to be somewhat cryptic, technical support engineers may have you run Dr. Watson to get debugging information to help them diagnose your problem.</P>

<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Windows 2000 stores most system information in several databases that constitute its Registry. You use a tool called <tt>regedt32</TT> to view this information and change it. Although some of this information is easy to understand, much of it is stored as binary and hexadecimal values, and changing these values could severely damage your Windows 2000 installation. Unless you have experience using <tt>regedt32</TT> and know exactly what you&#146;re changing in the Registry, don&#146;t make changes to your system via <tt>regedt32</TT>. Use Control Panel, and let it update the Registry. For more on <tt>regedt32</TT>, see Chapter 21, &#147;The Registry.&#148;<hr></FONT>

<p>The tools mentioned in this section can often be used in concert to diagnose system problems. Suppose you&#146;ve installed a network card that fails to work correctly. The first sign of trouble would be in the Event Viewer where error messages are entered into the System log. From there, you could open System Information and look at I/O resource assignments, where you might find that you had assigned the network card to use an IRQ that was already in use by another device.
</P>
<p>Without further ado, let&#146;s look at System Information. Figure 30.22 shows the System Summary console tree, which displays the version and build of Windows 2000 you&#146;re running, your CPU type, a serial number, and registration information. The System Summary contains information ranging from the manufacturer of your system and its model number, to the amount of memory free or the amount of page file in use.</P>

<p>Physical memory refers to the amount of RAM in your system, whereas Kernel memory refers to the amount of memory being used by Windows 2000 itself. The pagefile (swap file) information shows total size, amount in use, and peak use logged. If you notice that your peak usage isn&#146;t anywhere near the total pagefile size, you might want to think about reducing the size of your pagefile in the Control Panel. It is unlikely, though, that you&#146;ll come across that situation because Windows 2000 dynamically tunes the pagefile to closely match the amount of it you&#146;re using.

<p>To view information on the hardware installed in your computer, expand the Components console tree. For information about display hardware and drivers, click the Display folder. Windows 2000 displays the information shown in Figure 30.23.</P>
<p><a name="Fig25"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-25.jpg',640,451)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-25t.jpg"></A>

<p>The Display dialog box is often useful when you&#146;re having display problems and want to see which drivers Windows 2000 is using to communicate with your graphics card. Your display settings (pixel resolution, color depth, and vertical refresh rate) are all noted here. This dialog also makes available information about the amount of display memory your card has, which graphics chip your card uses, and which Random Access Memory Digital-to-Analog Converter (RAMDAC) your card uses.
</P>
<p>For information about the drives on your system as well as the network, expand the Storage console tree and click the Drives folder in the left pane. System Information displays the information shown in Figure 30.24.</P>
<p><a name="Fig26"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-26.jpg',640,451)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-26t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-26.jpg',640,451)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 30.24</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Drives folder in System Information</P>
<p>The Drives folder gives detailed information about local floppy, hard, and CD-ROM drives, as well as less-detailed information about network drives to which you&#146;re connected. Information about free and used space, as well as sector and cluster counts, is available here. No diagnostic tools are available. To bring these up, you&#146;ll need to launch Disk Management, or right-click a disk&#146;s icon, select Properties, and go to the Tools dialog box. Although there isn&#146;t really any diagnostic information available here per se, the Drives dialog box can indicate trouble with a drive simply by showing you that Windows 2000 cannot see the drive. For example, say you have an installed drive (a second hard drive, a CD-ROM drive, floppy drive, Jaz drive, etc.) that is <i>not</I> displayed on this list. The drive&#146;s absence may indicate either a faulty data or power cable connection to the unit. If the drive is a SCSI device, the SCSI chain may be incorrectly terminated. If it&#146;s a second EIDE hard drive, there may be an incorrect master-slave configuration on the second drive. Before looking at more complicated problems, always check your physical connections. Often, the solution is simpler than you think.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>You cannot get information about floppy, removable disk, or CD-ROM drives unless a disk is in the drive. With a disk present, you&#146;ll get information about that specific disk.<hr></FONT>

<p>For information about services, expand the Software Environment console tree and click the Services folder. Windows 2000 displays the dialog box shown in Figure 30.25.
