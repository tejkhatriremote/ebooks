<p>The Services folder is one of the most useful. It not only displays status information, but it also lists dependencies. Dependencies are important in diagnosing system problems because if one component fails, all devices or services dependent on that component will in turn fail. For example, if a network card fails to initialize, all protocol stacks that are set to bind to that network card will also fail to initialize and will be inoperative.
</P>
<p>For information about system resources, expand the Hardware Resources console tree and select one of the subfolders. System Information displays the view shown in Figure 30.26.</P>
<p><a name="Fig28"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-28.jpg',640,451)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-28t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-28.jpg',640,451)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 30.26</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hardware Resources console tree</P>
<p>The Hardware Resources folder can be most useful if you&#146;re having an I/O resource conflict. It displays information about interrupt requests (IRQs), direct memory access (DMA), and base I/O address usage by devices installed in your system. Additionally, you can see information about Shadow RAM usage. Shadow RAM is the 384KB segment of memory between 640KB and 1024KB, which is also known as the Expanded Memory area on PCs. Most machines will copy, or &#147;shadow,&#148; both the system ROM BIOS and the graphics card BIOS to this memory area so that the system can access them faster. Access time to DRAM is less than that of ROM.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Windows 2000 supports interrupt sharing by hardware devices to try to alleviate IRQ conflict problems. But older hardware devices that aren&#146;t aware of this feature frequently expect to be the sole possessors of a given IRQ and won&#146;t do very well sharing it with another device. The best plan of action is for each hardware device to have its own dedicated IRQ(s).<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Since Windows 2000 is a Plug-and-Play operating system, the values contained in System Information should be correct. But sometimes, a device won&#146;t be displayed here because its resources are in conflict with another device. In this case, the two devices in question should be displayed under the Conflicts/Sharing folder. It&#146;s a good idea to check here before you install a new device so that you can figure out which resources are allocated and which are available. Be sure to check all three resource types: IRQ, DMA, and base I/O.
</P>
<p>For Registry information, expand the Software Environment console tree, and click the Environment Variables folder. Windows 2000 displays the dialog box shown in Figure 30.27.</P>
<p><a name="Fig29"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-29.jpg',640,451)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-29t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-29.jpg',640,451)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 30.27</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Environment Variables folder</P>
<p>The Environment Variables folder is another view-only portion of System Information; it displays Registry information about CPUs and system paths. You can&#146;t edit this information, but it may be valuable for a technical support engineer trying to troubleshoot your system. Windows applications, in addition to using the system&#146;s pagefile, will often write temporary files for storing less frequently used data rather than using system memory. It&#146;s a method of &#147;cheating&#148; on the amount of memory the application allocates or using allocated memory for more immediate or more frequently used tasks.
</P>
<p>To create and print a report from any of the System Information folders, right-click the folder and select Print. System information will print all information for the selected folder.</P>
<p>Because System Information generates so much information, you have the option of saving or printing a report. You can easily print any or all of the information contained here, or you can save the information to a System Information file to be retrieved later. To save the information file, select Save As System information File from the Action menu. To save as a simple text file, you can select Save As Text File from the Action menu.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading19"></A><font color="#000077">Running Task Manager</FONT></H3>
<p>Task Manager (see Figure 30.28) is a tool that lets you quickly monitor and troubleshoot Windows 2000, particularly in terms of the programs you are running. Additionally, the Windows 2000 Professional Task Manager has added significant improvements over previous versions of Task Manager, most notably the capability to gauge system performance.
</P>
<p>To run Task Manager, you can do one of the following:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-click your Taskbar and choose Task Manager.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Type <b>taskmgr</B> in the Start menu&#146;s Run dialog box.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If your system is causing some difficulty that makes the above methods unavailable, you can also access the Task Manager by pressing the Ctrl+Alt+Delete key combination to open a Windows 2000 Security dialog box. From this dialog box you can run the Task Manager, lock the workstation, or quit Windows 2000.<hr></FONT>

<p>Task Manager is divided into three tabs: Applications, Processes, and Performance. Regardless of which tab you are looking at, the bottom of the Task Manager displays the number of processes being run, the percentage of CPU usage, and the amount of memory being used. Note that the memory measurement includes any virtual memory you may be using. This quick reference tells you everything you need to know in order to immediately understand Windows 2000&#146;s operating condition.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Task Manager Applications</B></FONT></P>
<p>Task Manager&#146;s Applications tab lists all running applications and their current status (see Figure 30.28). An application&#146;s status will either be Running, if the program is behaving properly, or Not Responding, if the program is having problems. There are three buttons lining the bottom of the Task Manager: End Task, Switch To, and New Task.
</P>
<p>Note that the End Task button in this tab closes any application you have selected. Even an application that is operating normally can be exited in this way. You can sort the contents of the Applications tab by task or by status.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Task Manager Processes</B></FONT></P>
<p>The Processes tab of Task Manager (see Figure 30.29) enables you to monitor any processes that are running on your computer. Processes are measured in all the separate executables that Windows 2000 runs concurrently. This includes any applications you are running and all the background executables that Windows 2000 runs automatically, including services. Clicking the End Process button can terminate each running process.
</P>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Don&#146;t end a process unless it is marked as being errant. Ending a process that is running may crash other programs that are running correctly if they depend on that process.<hr></FONT>
