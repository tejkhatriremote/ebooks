<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading17"></A><font color="#000077">Peer-to-Peer Networks</FONT></H4>
<p>Peer-to-peer networks represent a new and entirely different concept in networking than client-server networks. Rather than giving every computer on the network a central storage ground, peer-to-peer networking connects a group of totally independent computers, as depicted in Figure 23.12. Each computer generally keeps its applications on its own hard disk so that if something happens to the network, it simply breaks down into a group of individual yet functional computers. If one workstation goes down, life can go on for the rest of the network if all users keep their needed files at their own workstation. In other words, a peer-to-peer network enables every workstation to lead a double life: to be a workstation <i>and</I> a file server.</P>
<p><a name="Fig12"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch23/images/23-12.jpg',500,186)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch23/images/23-12t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch23/images/23-12.jpg',500,186)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 23.12</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of a peer-to-peer network</P>
<p>Peer-to-peer networks give their users many of the same capabilities that client-server networks do. Each user decides what capabilities and peripheral devices he or she will share with the rest of the network and then shares them. You can share things selectively, saying, perhaps, &#147;Accounting gets to use the C drive and Personnel gets to use the printer,&#148; and you can attach passwords to your resources so that unauthorized people can&#146;t access them. On the subject of sharing resources, remember that because important information on a peer-to-peer LAN is distributed throughout the network, you&#146;ll have to leave networked machines on and logged on to the network as long as anyone is working who needs the information on those machines.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Judging Peer-to-Peer Packages</B></FONT></P>
<p>When shopping for a peer-to-peer network, you should keep three things in mind:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How good are its communications abilities?
<p>Most peer-to-peer packages include their own e-mail and chat capabilities, allowing both e-mail and real-time communications. A good package provides users with a list of other users available for chats and has both single-mode and multimode chat utilities.
</P>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How capable is its resource sharing?
<p>Although peer-to-peer networks often expect each workstation to keep its own applications on file, you may prefer to locate some applications centrally and let people pick them up from another machine. You&#146;ll also be sharing devices such as drives, CD-ROMs, and printers. The best packages notify users when a workstation with shared resources leaves the network.
</P>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How suitable is it for small-office use (since that&#146;s likely what you&#146;ll be using it for)?
<p>Because peer-to-peer networks rarely have network managers, you&#146;ll want a network that is as easy to control as possible. A good peer-to-peer should be easy to install and set up, and have good print and file management tools to control shared resources. Although peer-to-peer networks are not famous for their security, you&#146;ll also want some way of controlling access to shared resources.
</DL>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Understanding Peer-to-Peer Operations</B></FONT></P>
<p>We have explored how a client-server network operates, but how does a peer-to-peer network work? On a stand-alone machine, when you ask your operating system (for example, DOS) to access the drive, it can do it directly. The application talks directly to DOS, which sends the information to the BIOS, which sends the information to the computer&#146;s disk. DOS needs no go-between to help it access information and peripherals on its own computer.
</P>
<p>If you&#146;re working on a network, however, the situation is a little different. DOS needs help accessing information on other computers on the network. Its helper is called the <i>redirector</I> (or the <i>shell,</I> if you&#146;re a Novell user). We discuss the redirector in more detail in Chapter 24, &#147;Essentials of Windows 2000 Networking.&#148;</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Weighing the Advantages of Using a Peer-to-Peer Network</B></FONT></P>
<p>At first glance, client-server networks seem to have all the advantages. When you look again, however, you discover that isn&#146;t necessarily the case. For small networks, peer-to-peer has a number of advantages:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn&#146;t require a dedicated workstation (although using one is still a good idea for the reasons we discussed earlier).
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#146;s an easy way to connect and share information on the workstations that you already have in your office.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#146;s cheaper than duplicating your purchases of printers, CD-ROMs, etc., for every person in the office, and probably more efficient for printer sharing than products such as print buffers and physical print spoolers.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It costs less than a client-server LAN and doesn&#146;t require a degree in engineering to set up and administer.
</DL>
<p>In short, peer-to-peer networking does not offer the flexibility or the complete security of a file server workstation relationship, but for a small installation it will probably more than fit the bill.
</P>
<h3><a name="Heading18"></A><font color="#000077">Summary</FONT></H3>
<p>You should now have enough under your belt to describe your needs to any network cabler you might run into. What more is there to know? Well, for starters, in the next chapter we present Windows 2000&#146;s idiosyncrasies when it comes to working over the network you&#146;ve decided to set up, and in the chapter following that we discuss one more specific type of network you may want to connect to: a Novell NetWare network.
