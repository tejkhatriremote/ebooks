<p>Client-server networks are similar in some ways to the old mainframe/terminal networks. In each, a central computer is in charge of the network and handles all requests. The main difference is that the client computers are able to compute on their own (assuming that they&#146;re PCs), unlike the dumb terminals. Figure 23.11 shows a client-server network configuration.

<p>For large organizations, client-server networks have several advantages:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;They are often more upgradeable than peer-to-peer networks.
</DL>
<p>Client-server networks are often more flexible than peer-to-peer networks. They have more options available to them and more software is written for client-server networks than for peer-to-peer. In addition, more industry information is available, which is helpful when you&#146;re trying to figure out a problem.
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;They give their administrators better control of the network.
</DL>
<p>In peer-to-peer networks, each user is, to an extent, his or her own administrator. Client-server networks are controlled by an administrator who decides which peripherals and files each user may attach to.
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;They are infinitely expandable.
</DL>
<p>Peer-to-peer networks can expand easily but don&#146;t work well with more than about 15 nodes. Client-server networks, on the other hand, can expand to hundreds of machines, even tens or hundreds of thousands in a wide area network (WAN).
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;They are more secure from unauthorized access.
</DL>
<p>Client-server networks use much tighter and more efficient security than peer-to-peer networks use. Most client-server networks require a user to provide a password and logon ID before accessing the network from a client computer. That password and ID will provide that user access only to the files and devices that the user is authorized to access. In addition, the password and ID tell the file server exactly what kind of file access that user has (read-only or full) and how they can manipulate files, by moving them or marking them for other users to share.
</P>
<p>Client-server networks have their liabilities, of course. They&#146;re generally much more expensive per node than peer-to-peer networks and they are harder to set up. Even for an experienced administrator, setting up the server could entail hours of work. And adding new clients to the network can be time-consuming.</P>
<p>Expense and administration aside, however, client-server networks are best suited for large companies. Let&#146;s take a look at some of the kinds of servers you might see on a client-server network.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Disk Servers</B></FONT></P>
<p>A <i>disk server</I> is a central repository for files and data, attached to the network like any other node and appearing to each workstation as another local hard disk.</P>
<p>Saving information to a disk server is just like saving information to a local hard disk, but retrieving information from the disk server is a bit more complex. On a stand-alone workstation, in order to retrieve information from the hard disk, the computer must look up the file&#146;s location on the <i>File Allocation Table</I> (the FAT). After the computer finds the file&#146;s location in the FAT, it moves the read/write heads to that location on the hard disk and copies the file into memory.</P>
<p>It&#146;s not quite so easy to retrieve information from a disk server. You see, the disk server keeps its <i>own</I> FAT, and any time a workstation wants to retrieve information from the disk server, the disk server must send a copy of its FAT to the workstation. The workstation then stores a copy of the FAT in memory. To access information on the disk server, the workstation will first get a copy (to keep) of the disk server&#146;s FAT and then use that copy to see where the file is on the disk server&#146;s hard disk. Thus, when a workstation accesses a disk server, the following drama occurs.</P>
<p>The disk server can probably see the potential hazard. The whole point of a network is to give a number of people access to the network&#146;s capabilities, right? However, the first time someone accesses the disk server, the user will get a copy of the FAT as it looked <i>at that time</I>. Every time anyone adds or deletes a file from the server&#146;s hard disk, the FAT changes. Therefore, if you get a copy of the disk server&#146;s FAT at 8:00 in the morning, by 2:30 that afternoon it&#146;s likely that your copy no longer matches the original. Because the disk server&#146;s CPU uses its outdated map to search for the data on the hard disk, your data retrieval could slow down or grind to a halt.</P>
<p>To get around this potential hazard, disk servers are usually divided or partitioned into several volumes, each volume reserved for a different workstation. In order to share information, it&#146;s saved on the &#147;read-only&#148; public volume, protecting the FAT&#146;s integrity on the disk server.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>File Servers</B></FONT></P>
<p>Disk servers, as you can see, can be complicated and are potentially dangerous to work with. These days, <i>file servers</I> are much more common. File servers are a more complex animal than their predecessor, the disk server. A file server usually has its own operating system, forming a shell around the disk operating system environment. This operating system filters out network commands and DOS commands, translating DOS commands to network commands, and vice versa.</P>
<p>File servers and disk servers are similar in function; that is, they provide a central place for workstations to store data. The main difference between a file server and a disk server is that a file server maintains its own FAT and does its own searching for files on its hard disk. When a workstation requests a file, the file server checks its FAT to see where the file is located on the hard disk and then moves the hard drive&#146;s rewrite heads to that location. After copying the data from the hard disk, the file server sends the copy of the file to the workstation that made the request.</P>
<p>The difference between a disk server and a file server could perhaps be expressed like this: When a workstation asks a disk server for a file for the first time that day, the disk server rummages in its drawer and finds a map of the storeroom where it keeps the files, telling the workstation, &#147;Go ahead and get the file, kid, but keep the map; I&#146;ve got better things to do than keep you supplied with maps.&#148; Every time a workstation gets something from the storeroom or returns something, the storeroom gets a little reorganized, but because it has an automatic update, the disk server always hands out accurate maps. When workstations come back to look for files using their old maps, however, it&#146;s quite possible that the storeroom will be rearranged and that they won&#146;t be able to find anything.</P><p><br></P>
