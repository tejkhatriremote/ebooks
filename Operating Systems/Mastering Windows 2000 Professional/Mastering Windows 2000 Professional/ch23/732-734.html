<p>The file server, on the other hand, would rather find things itself than have a bunch of workstations rummaging through its hard disk. When a workstation asks for a file, the file server says, &#147;I&#146;ll send it right out&#151;no, really, I&#146;d rather do it.&#148; It then finds the file, makes a copy of it for the workstation, and sends it through the network to the workstation that requested it.
</P>
<p>File servers have a number of advantages over disk servers. First, because file servers don&#146;t need to copy the FAT to the workstation, only one record of file locations exists and the file server maintains it. Second, the server no longer has to divide its hard disk into volumes, so the server&#146;s entire disk can be shared with all workstations. This arrangement, as you recall, was <i>not</I> the case with the disk server.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The server&#146;s entire disk <i>can</I> be shared with all workstations, but isn&#146;t necessarily. File servers generally have stringent security measures that restrict file access to users with the proper access rights. The files a user can access depend upon his or her access rights.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><b>Dedicated and Nondedicated File Servers</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear discussions of file servers, you&#146;ll sometimes hear people talking about dedicated file servers and nondedicated file servers. A <i>dedicated file server</I> has its own hard disk drive, and its only goal in life is to be a file server. By dedicating a computer as a file server, you restrict its memory to file server functions. A <i>nondedicated file server,</I> on the other hand, is a workstation that moonlights as a file server&#151;its memory is divided between workstation functions and file server functions.</P>
<p>Why would you want a dedicated file server? A dedicated file server is faster, safer, and more efficient than one also being used as a workstation. It&#146;s faster because all the memory and all the processes that this computer does are file-server related, and it&#146;s safer because no one&#146;s using the machine as a workstation and possibly crashing it (everyone crashes <i>sometimes</I>). It is more efficient because it does not have to divide its time between being a file server and being a workstation. In short, dedicating your file server greatly improves your network&#146;s performance. Of course, the downside of a dedicated file server is that it can be expensive, because you must buy a computer just to hold and maintain the integrity and security of your information. Because your file server will have a lot of demands on it, you&#146;re going to want something fast with a big hard disk, and that type of machine isn&#146;t cheap.</P>
<p>The expense of a dedicated file server gives nondedicated file servers their place in life. A lower price tag is just about the only advantage you get from using your file server as a workstation. Nondedicated file servers tend to be slower than dedicated ones because any time the server needs CPU time to perform workstation tasks, the other workstations have to wait to access the server. This wait time can slow down your entire network. Also, if your file server crashes&#151;something far more likely to happen on a server that someone&#146;s using for a workstation than one used only for administration purposes&#151;you can lose data all over your network. Having worked on networks with both dedicated and nondedicated file servers, we can honestly say that dedicated is a better bet if you can afford the extra machine. Nondedicated file servers may be a viable option for very small networks, but if you have 50 or 100 nodes on your network, the risk of data loss is more expensive than the extra machine. In the long run, the cost of buying an extra computer to be a dedicated file server will turn out to be less than that of losing your network&#146;s data.</P>
<p>If you <i>must</I> use a server as a workstation, better to make it a server that won&#146;t cause disaster if it crashes. Many nondedicated servers today are printer servers, fax servers, or e-mail servers. If one of those crashes, it&#146;s a pain in the neck but probably won&#146;t cause the annual report to go down in flames.</P><p><br></P>
