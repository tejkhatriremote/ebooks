<p><font size="+1"><b>Concentrators</B></FONT></P>
<p><i>Concentrators</I> are like &#147;build-it-yourself&#148; active hubs. A concentrator is a big box with expansion slots in it. An average concentrator could have up to 16 expansion slots. If you want the concentrator to be a straightforward hub, then you can purchase a port card with 4, 8, or 16 ports to which you can attach computers. You can put your first port card in slot 0. Assuming that your port card had eight ports on it, you would then be able to attach up to eight devices to the concentrator. This would be a good setup for a small network. The advantage of a concentrator is the capability to add more port cards as your network grows. If you want to add another small department of six people, add another eight-port card in slot 1.</P>
<p>And the fun is just beginning. As your network grows, you may have to provide a gateway service to your mainframe system in your office. No problem&#151;just purchase a gateway card and put it into slot 2. Now all 16 of your current users (8 attached to slot 0 and 8 attached to slot 1) can go through the gateway card to get to the mainframe system. If distance between nodes is becoming a problem, add a repeater card so that all network packets are repeated as they flow through the hub. You can keep adding cards to the concentrator as your needs grow. If you are concerned that you might run out of slots, fear not. There is a slot specifically reserved for a backbone card that enables you to connect one concentrator to another so that they act as one large concentrator.</P>
<p>Of hub, MAU, and concentrator, the concentrator is the most expensive but it does provide the greatest flexibility in terms of growth for your network.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>In practice, the preceding terms are often used interchangeably. For instance, many folks use the term <i>hub</I> when they are referring to a <i>concentrator</I>. In the paragraphs above, we&#146;ve given the true definitions of each term, but some of you may think those definitions are wrong because you&#146;ve been hearing the industry use the terms loosely and often incorrectly. So don&#146;t be thrown when you are looking through articles or catalogs and you see mention of an eight-port stand-alone concentrator with no space to add additional cards. It is just the industry&#146;s way of keeping us on our toes. For the rest of this book we bow to common usage and use the term <i>hub</I> to refer to all three options generically.<hr></FONT>

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading5"></A><font color="#000077">Star Topology Continued</FONT></H4>
<p>On a network with a star topology, the server never has to wonder how to get information back to the terminal that asked the question. The server just finds the port to which the node in question connects and relays the information.
</P>
<p>The star topology is nice for awkwardly arranged networks. As a simple example, imagine a network with four computers: three workstations and one server. If one workstation is upstairs and two are downstairs but in separate rooms, cabling the network is relatively easy if you don&#146;t have to worry about connecting all the nodes to each other and can concentrate on connecting the individual workstations to the hub.</P>
<p>Of course, the star topology has one major drawback&#151;the large amount of cable it uses. Having a centralized hub isn&#146;t the most cable-efficient arrangement, so if you&#146;re concerned about cable costs and your nodes are close together, you might want to consider the bus topology.</P>

<table border="2" bordercolor="#0000" align="CENTER">
<tr><td><font size="+1"><b>Troubleshooting a Star Topology</B></FONT>
<p>Another big advantage to the star topology is that it&#146;s easy to troubleshoot. As you&#146;ll see in the discussion of the bus topology, if your bus network fails, you will have difficulty pinpointing exactly where the problem lies without a node-to-node search. On a star network, in contrast, finding the source of a problem is easy. If one node doesn&#146;t work, the problem probably lies somewhere between the port of the hub and the node. You should check to see if the problem lies with:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The terminal itself
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The cable between the hub and the terminal
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The port on the hub that services the troubled terminal
</DL>
<p>First, check whether the Network Interface Card (NIC) is configured correctly. Ensure that no hardware conflicts exist in terms of I/O addresses, IRQs, or DMA channels. You may also want to run a memory test on the workstation such as Checkit Pro from Touchstone Software, as well as run a hard drive testing utility such as SpinRite from Gibson Research.
</P>
<p>If none of the network nodes work, the problem probably lies with the server, and it&#146;s time to hope that you planned for fault tolerance and that you did your backups.</P>
