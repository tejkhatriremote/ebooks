<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading10"></A><font color="#000077">When a Bus Is Not a Bus: 10BaseT</FONT></H4>
<p>To really understand how a network can use one physical topology and another logical topology, let&#146;s take a look at 10BaseT, a kind of Ethernet network that has a bus logical topology and a star physical topology. Figure 23.6 shows how a 10BaseT network is cabled.
</P>
<p><a name="Fig6"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch23/images/23-06.jpg',500,477)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch23/images/23-06t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch23/images/23-06.jpg',500,477)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 23.6</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;A 10BaseT-distributed star configuration</P>
<p>10BaseT looks like a set of stars connected by a bus. It still behaves as if it were a bus&#151;it broadcasts to the network&#151;but it&#146;s cabled like a star, using unshielded twisted-pair (UTP). Therefore, this network is a <i>logical</I> bus but a <i>physical</I> star. Why does 10BaseT use this connected-star approach? It might seem contrary to logic, because a star network involves more cable than a bus and so should not be a preferred cabling scheme from a cost-of-wiring point of view.</P>
<p>But this connected-star approach has a major benefit: It is easy to troubleshoot. Suppose you&#146;re setting up a network in a building with multiple floors. On each floor, you create a wiring closet. Then you run cables (the 10BaseT specifications limit each cable&#146;s length to no more than 100 meters) from the wiring closet to each workstation on that floor. Next, connect each floor&#146;s wiring closet to the next floor&#146;s wiring closet with a cable. Now you&#146;ve got a connected star&#151;a star network on each floor and a bus connecting the floors. The cable that is used to connect one hub to another hub is generally referred to as a backbone. The term <i>backbone</I> describes a concept rather than a particular type of cable. You always want to make sure that the cable that you use for the backbone is rated for speeds that meet or exceed the speed of the cable that you are using throughout the network (from hub to the nodes). The value of all this extra cable lies in your test instruments in the wiring closet. When someone complains that his or her workstation no longer works with the network, you can go straight to the wiring closet and test the particular cable. All the cables will be arranged in a nice, neat order, with clearly marked labels indicating which cable goes to what workstation.</P>
<p>Inside each wiring closet is a 10BaseT hub, the device that enables all the computers on a floor to interact as an Ethernet network. This hub connects to the next hub, thus connecting each hub to the computers on the network. You can test the hub by taking a portable computer to the hub, plugging it in, and trying to make a network connection. Some hubs (known as <i>smart hubs</I>, appropriately enough) even assume diagnostic functions. They monitor the amount and type of information being supplied by the client computers and detect errors on computers in the network. You can also pay for software that will enable you to monitor the hubs from a central location. For example, we&#146;ve said that on a LAN only one device can &#147;talk&#148; at a time. One particular type of hardware failure makes a computer chatter away endlessly, locking up the network, but a smart hub detects this failure and disconnects that malfunctioning computer from the network.</P>
<p>Of course, the connected star approach of 10BaseT would simplify this debugging step even if you didn&#146;t have a smart hub; you could simply connect a portable computer to the hub&#151;and then try to use the network. If the network is busy because of a chattering computer, then disconnect one of the computers at the hub and try the portable again. Because all the connections are right at your fingertips, you need only a minute or two to test all of the connections to find the chatterer.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading11"></A><font color="#000077">IEEE&#146;s Topological Protocols</FONT></H3>
<p>In 1980, the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) attempted to make some sense out of all the conflicting standards, protocols, and manufacturing methods of cabling and logical topologies. The following list, though not exhaustive, should give you a feel for some of the characteristics of these standards and how the IEEE committees work. Some of this information also appears elsewhere in the book, so don&#146;t worry if something looks familiar.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading12"></A><font color="#000077">The 802.3 Standard</FONT></H4>
<p>When the IEEE 802.3 committee met, Ethernet standards were already a powerhouse in the cabling configuration field, thanks to industry acceptance. However, the 802.3 committee was reluctant to force all new networks topologies to follow the strict Ethernet as set out by Xerox and DEC, so it said, &#147;Let&#146;s try to come up with an Ethernet-<i>like</I> standard,&#148; and the 802.3 standard was born. The 802.3 standard includes the older Ethernet protocol specifications in addition to changes in the basic structure of the data packets.</P>
<p>Although all Ethernet-type networks use the 802.3 standard, 10Base2, which uses both a physical and a logical bus topology, is the most common. It uses 50-ohm coaxial baseband cable (refer back to Chapter 22 if you need to) and can send data at 10Mbps. Information travels the network in packets consisting of the following parts (see Figure 23.7):</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Preamble</B>
<dd>Eight bytes of information used to coordinate the rest of the information in the packet.
<dt><b>Destination address</B>
<dd>The network address of the workstation or workstations that are to receive this information.
<dt><b>Source address</B>
<dd>The address that enables the receiving workstation or workstations to recognize the workstation that sent the information.
<dt><b>Type or Length</B>
<dd>The type of information that is held within the data part of this packet, whether it is graphics information, ASCII text information, or any other type of data. If the type is not listed, this field will contain the length of the packet.
<br>This information is crucial to the sending process because the receiving station can&#146;t understand bitmaps if it&#146;s expecting text (or vice versa). Think of what happens when you drink orange juice when you&#146;re expecting milk. It doesn&#146;t taste like either one, and you probably can&#146;t identify it, at least not right away.
<dt><b>Actual data</B>
<dd>The data can be anywhere from 46 to 1,500 bytes long.
<dt><b>Frame-check sequence</B>
<dd>A &#147;packing slip&#148; to verify that the rest of the packet reached its destination intact.
