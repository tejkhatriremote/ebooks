<p>As mentioned earlier, Ethernet is probably the best-known example of a logical bus network; it certainly is the most popular LAN type. Ethernet is an example of a <i>logical</I> bus topology, but&#151;as we&#146;ll see in a minute, it is not always a <i>physical</I> bus topology. (Yes, we keep hammering that home, but the concept isn&#146;t easy to grasp.)</P>
<p>How does the bus topology work? Simply put, each time a node on the network has data for another node, it broadcasts the data to the entire network. The various nodes hear the broadcast and look to see if the data is for them. If it is, they keep it. If it&#146;s not, they pass it down again until it reaches the correct destination.</P>
<p>Whatever anyone on the bus says, everyone hears. It&#146;s something like the old telephone party lines, in which several neighbors shared a telephone number. A distinctive ring was assigned to each person on the line so that everyone could answer their own calls. If your code was, say, three quick rings, and you heard the telephone ring three quick rings, you could pick it up and know it was for you. On the other hand, if you heard two long rings and one short ring, you&#146;d know that the call was for your neighbor Burt and ignore it. In all cases, everyone heard the rings but only one person responded&#151;the person whom the call was for.</P>
<p>The bus topology works in a similar fashion. Every Ethernet card has a 48-bit address peculiar to itself, and each piece of data that travels the network is directed to the address of the card in the node that should receive the data. All nodes on the network can see the data, but if it&#146;s not addressed to them, they ignore it and pass it down until it reaches the correct destination. (Bus networks work better than the old party lines that way&#151;your neighbor&#146;s machine can&#146;t eavesdrop on data not sent to it.)</P>
<p>So now you know how data finds its destination on the network, but how do networked computers send the data in the first place? On a bus network, every workstation can send out information in a package called a <i>packet</I>. Data transmitted on a network of <i>any</I> type must conform to a strict format called the <i>Data Link Layer Frame format,</I> which that network type uses for arranging data. Ethernet&#146;s format looks like Figure 23.5.</P>
<p><a name="Fig5"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch23/images/23-05.jpg',450,68)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch23/images/23-05t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch23/images/23-05.jpg',450,68)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 23.5</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The composition of a Data Link Layer Ethernet frame</P>
<p>Each packet can be no longer than 1,518 bytes, just to make sure that one workstation doesn&#146;t hog the network for too long. Before a workstation broadcasts to the network, it listens to see if anyone else is using the network. If the coast is clear, then the workstation broadcasts.
</P>
<p>What if the coast isn&#146;t clear? Ethernet is the topology that has to worry about that situation. When a node has a packet to send across the network, it &#147;listens&#148; to the cable to hear if any frequencies are going across the cable. If the sending node, we&#146;ll call it node A, detects a frequency on the cable, it will wait for the current packet to go by and then send its packet. If node A detects that the line is free, it will go ahead and send its packet.</P>
<p>The biggest problem with this broadcast method is distance, as we discussed in Chapter 22, &#147;An In-Depth Introduction to Networks.&#148; If the distance between node A and node B is too great, the nodes might not &#147;hear&#148; each other on the line and might both send packets at the same time. What follows is known as a <i>packet collision</I>. If a collision occurs, it will cause a frequency &#147;ripple&#148; on the cable. The first node to detect this increased frequency ripple sends out a high frequency signal, which cancels out all other signals. This signal tells all nodes that a collision has occurred and that all nodes on the network should stop sending packets. At this point each node waits a random amount of time and then tries broadcasting again. Nodes can repeat this wait-and-listen routine up to 16 times before giving up.</P>
<p>The way that nodes decide when to resend their data is actually pretty neat. The system is known by the unfortunate name of <i>truncated binary exponential backoff</I>. (No, unlike almost everything else in the LAN world, it doesn&#146;t have a convenient and commonly used abbreviation.) In English, this name means that after two nodes collide, each node on the network randomly generates a whole number between 1 and 2, multiplies that number by 1/2, and then waits that number of milliseconds before retransmitting. Of course, the first time out the chances are 50-50 that A and B will pick the same number, so they might have to retry again. The next time, A and B randomly pick a number between 1 and 4 and do the same thing. If they pick the same number again, they&#146;ll pick a number between 1 and 8. This goes on, doubling each time, either until A and B choose different numbers and send their information or the 16 tries are up and they stop trying. The chances are pretty good that both A and B will get to send their data, however, by the time they get to the 16th try. The delay could be up to half a second, which for a network that transmits data at 10 million bits per second is an eternity. A bus network rarely needs that many retries.</P>
<p>How likely are collisions? Having cable no longer than it&#146;s supposed to be decreases your chance of a collision because the nodes can &#147;hear&#148; other nodes broadcasting more easily; but the way the bus logical topology works <i>increases</I> the likelihood of packet collisions. Consider: If a node can&#146;t broadcast until the network is clear and more than one node has information to send, what&#146;s going to happen as soon as the line is free? Both nodes will leap to get their information out first, and the result is a collision.</P>
<p>Keep in mind that all this processing takes place at the Ethernet NIC. Therefore, if you are going to use the Ethernet topology, all your nodes must have Ethernet cards. Ethernet can run on top of a physical bus, physical star, or physical ring.</P>
<p>Ethernet isn&#146;t the only example of a bus topology, but it is the most used. For a while, AT&T marketed a one-megabit-per-second (Mbps) version of Ethernet called StarLAN. StarLAN is now a 10Mbps network, but now and then you&#146;ll see installations using the old StarLAN. Among the other Ethernet-like proprietary networks is ArtiSoft&#146;s LANtastic. Another, perhaps better known example is the LocalTalk/AppleTalk network built into Macintosh computers. LocalTalk transmits at only 250,00bps but employs many of the basic design principles found in Ethernet.</P><p><br></P>
