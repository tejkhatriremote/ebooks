<p>Performance provides four views. You access these views by clicking the buttons on the left side of the toolbar. You can also click the View menu and select a view. The four views are simply different displays of the data that Performance can report, ranging from graphics to log files. Here&#146;s a quick rundown on Performance&#146;s views:
</P>
<table width="100%"><tr>
<td width="5%" valign="TOP"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-12i.jpg"><td><b>Chart</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Displays counters graphically. You can add as many counters as you like, although more than about a half-dozen makes for a rather cluttered graph.
<tr>
<td valign="TOP"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-13i.jpg"><td><b>Histogram</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Histogram view is another form of the Chart view. Instead of a chart that display the historic data, the Histogram view displays bar graphs that dynamically update as the data changes.
<tr>
<td valign="TOP"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-14i.jpg"><td><b>Alert</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Enables you to assign a threshold value (minimum or maximum) to a counter. You can specify that exceeding the threshold causes an event to be logged in Performance&#146;s Alerts log or launches a program the first time the event occurs or every time the event occurs. The Alert view is accessed through the Performance Logs and Alerts branch of the console tree.
<tr>
<td valign="TOP"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-15i.jpg"><td><b>Log</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Enables you to specify counters to write to a log file at intervals from 1 to 3600 seconds. The Log view can be accessed directly from Performance, or through the Performance Logs and Alerts branch of the console tree.
<tr>
<td valign="TOP"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-16i.jpg"><td><b>Report</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Displays counters in real time (as Chart view does). Selected counters are listed and their values are updated at a specified rate.
</TABLE>
<p>Before getting into detail about each of these views, let&#146;s look at some counters you&#146;re most likely to monitor.
</P>
<p>Windows 2000 classifies its subsystem components into objects, and each object has anywhere from two to more than a dozen counters that you can monitor. In addition, certain objects&#151;such as processors, physical disks, and logical disks&#151;also have instances because your Windows 2000 system may have more than one of these types of hardware. Suppose, for example, that you want to monitor part of a specific process (created when a program is running in Windows 2000). By selecting the process object, you&#146;d see all processes currently running in the Instance field of the Add Counters view (shown in Figure 30.9). You could then select that process (in other words a specific instance of a process), and select which counter to monitor.</P>
<p><a name="Fig11"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-11.jpg',398,313)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-11t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-11.jpg',398,313)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 30.9</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Windows 2000 object has a variety of counters, and some, such as CPUs, have instances because there may be more than one of that type of object.</P>
<p>Though more for network administrators, another cool feature is Performance&#146;s capability to track counters on other systems on your network. For instance, if you found your machine reading and writing to your hard disk frequently or accessing the swap file, and you were curious to see if a coworker with a similar Windows 2000 system was experiencing the same situation, you could set a counter to watch that machine&#146;s swap file activity and compare it with that of your own machine. To do so, you&#146;d access the Profile System Performance on that person&#146;s machine.
</P>
<p>So without further ado, let&#146;s take a look at several objects and some of their counters. Again, Performance can track hundreds of counters, and to detail every one of them would make this book an encyclopedia. Information about all counters is available within Performance if you really want to drill down and look at specific system components. You can do this by clicking the Explain button on the Add Counters dialog box.</P>
<p>Tables 30.1, 30.2, 30.3, and 30.4 show you the counters, their functions, and their importance for four objects: the paging file object, the processor object, the Logicaldisk object, and the server object.</P>
