Let&#146;s take a look at these tools and how they can help you keep your system running smoothly.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Running Backup</FONT></H3>
<p>To start the Backup application, click Start, and then select Programs <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-01i.jpg"> Accessories <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-02i.jpg"> System Tools <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-03i.jpg"> Backup. Windows 2000 will display the Backup window, as shown in Figure 30.1.</P>
<p><a name="Fig1"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-01.jpg',641,478)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-01t.jpg"></A>

<p>The opening tab of the Backup program gives you a choice between three wizards to make Backup operations easy. You can use the wizards to create backup and restore jobs as well as Emergency Repair Disks (ERDs). Backup is the new location for this last wizard. If, however, you are familiar with backup programs, you can create them directly in the graphical interface. Just select the Backup, Restore, or Schedule Jobs tab to go directly to the function you need. The graphical interface still supports command-line operations for use in batch files. Unlike its NT predecessor though, Windows 2000 Backup can back up to any supported device, including floppy disk, hard disk, network drive, tape drive, or even CD-ROM.
</P>
<h3><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">Running Disk Management</FONT></H3>
<p>In Windows NT, you would use the Disk Administrator tool to manage disk partitions and handle all of your formatting chores. In Windows 2000, the corresponding tool is Disk Management, which is part of the Computer Management console in Administrative Tools. To reach this tool, click Start, select Settings <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-04i.jpg"> Control Panel <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-05i.jpg"> Administrative Tools, then double-click the Computer Management icon. Expand the Storage console tree by clicking the plus sign to the left of the Storage icon. Click Disk Management, and you will see the view shown in Figure 30.2.</P>
<p><a name="Fig2"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-02.jpg',638,452)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch30/images/30-02t.jpg"></A>

<p>The Disk Management tool, which is displayed in the right pane of the Computer Management console, will give you a graphical representation of the hard disks and CD-ROM devices in your computer. However, Disk Management has a variety of views, so you can customize the way information is presented to you.

<p>The Disk Management console is broken up into three parts. On the left is the Tree view of the Computer Management console. The lower-right pane of the display contains the information for all of the physical disks installed in the computer, excluding floppy drives. The upper-right pane contains descriptions of those disks, including data on the amount of space used and free, the type of file system, and the health of that system.
</P>
<p>To use Disk Management to create or delete partitions, format drives, and create stripe or volume sets, simply click the disk that you wish to modify, and select the change that you want to make from the Action menu. Or, you can right-click the drive that you want to modify, and then select the appropriate action from the Context menu.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading4"></A><font color="#000077">Deciding Which File System Is Best</FONT></H4>
<p>Windows 2000 can use the File Allocation Table (FAT) file system supported by DOS and Windows 95, the File Allocation Table 32 (FAT32) file system supported by Windows 98, and the New Technology File System (NTFS) supported by Windows NT. Each has its respective upsides and downsides. Here&#146;s a quick rundown.
</P>
<p>If you dual-boot your system, you need to use the FAT file system because DOS and Windows 95 cannot read a partition formatted using NTFS. FAT&#146;s main advantages are its backward-compatibility with DOS and Windows 95 and its slightly-faster overall performance, which is due, in large part, to its lack of security features. Security features, though useful and at times invaluable, do introduce overhead that can slow disk performance. Moreover, unlike previous versions of Windows NT, FAT supports long filenames in version 4 and in Windows 2000.</P>
<p>FAT&#146;s main disadvantage is that it&#146;s a 16-bit file system with a minimum cluster size of 32KB. The result is that FAT can address partitions only up to 2GB. If your drive is larger than this, you&#146;ll have to create two partitions to use FAT. Also, FAT has no security features. As a positive note, under Windows NT, the FAT file system has a maximum file and partition size of 4GB.</P>
<p>The FAT32 file system evolved from the traditional FAT file system used by DOS and Windows. One of the big benefits of having FAT32 support added to Windows 2000 is that you can easily dual-boot between Windows 98 and Windows 2000 on the same partition. This file system also allows for much larger volumes&#151;it supports volumes of as much as 16GB in size&#151;with smaller cluster sizes than FAT, yet it doesn&#146;t support as large a volume size as NTFS. Another downside to FAT32 is that, like FAT, it does not provide any local security.</P>
<p>In contrast, NTFS is a robust, 32-bit file system with many security features, including password protection for specific files, the capability to limit access to specific files, file compression, file recovery, and the capability to address very large partitions. Although a system using NTFS will run a bit slower than one using FAT in some cases, NTFS is your best bet if you want Windows 2000&#146;s additional features.</P><p><br></P>
