<p>Dynamic volumes come in various flavors:
</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Simple</B>
<dd>A Simple dynamic volume is very similar to a traditional partition in that it exists on a single drive. It can be resized by extending the volume if it is on a dynamic disk that was created as a dynamic disk and not upgraded from a basic disk.
<dt><b>Spanned</B>
<dd>This dynamic volume spans two or more disks to create one logical volume, as its name implies, but it can be extended. Spanned volumes are the same as volume sets in NT 4, but in Windows 2000 they are only available on dynamic disks.
<dt><b>Mirrored</B>
<dd>This volume type is only available on Windows 2000 Server. Mirrored volumes provide fault tolerance by keeping an exact mirror image of all data in the volume. If you lose one disk, you still have an exact copy of all of the data.
<dt><b>Striped</B>
<dd>Striped volumes are the fastest type of dynamic volume and yield great benefits in performance. They are not fault tolerant, however. If you lose one disk, you lose all of the data in the volume. They are the same as the traditional stripe sets available in NT, but stripe volumes are only available in Windows 2000 on dynamic disks.
<dt><b>RAID 5</B>
<dd>This type of dynamic volume is only available in Windows 2000 Server. RAID 5 is also known as striping with parity. RAID 5 allows the volume to lose one hard disk without failing. It does this by combining the remaining data with the parity information to recreate the data on-the-fly.
</DL>

<p><font size="+1"><b>Working with Disks and Volumes in Windows 2000</B></FONT></P>
<p>Before we go on, let&#146;s look in more detail at three specific Windows 2000 features we&#146;ve already mentioned&#151;file compression, security, and scanning for bad sectors&#151;and then at a new feature in Windows 2000&#151;a hard-disk defragmenter.
</P>
<p><b>Using File Compression in NTFS</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;One cool feature of the NTFS file system is its compression capability. Windows 2000 can compress entire volumes, individual subfolders (also called subdirectories), and files. The compression ratio usually winds up being about 1.5:1, or 33 percent. For example, Windows 2000 would compress a 100MB file to about 67MB. Generally, it&#146;s better not to compress files that contain multimedia data because more often than not, they&#146;re already using their own compression algorithm (or codec, see Chapter 7, &#147;Running Multimedia Applications&#148;). Also, because multimedia files are played back in real time (at a specified data rate rather than as fast as possible), the added overhead of NTFS decompression may adversely affect audio or video quality, causing breaks in the audio or frames to be skipped in the video.</P>
<p>Database files are probably also best left uncompressed because decompressing the database each time you run a query on it will slow performance.</P>
<p>NTFS compression is great for files that you need to keep around but don&#146;t access often. It&#146;s also good for files you access regularly if you don&#146;t mind a slight performance hit because of the extra hard-disk real estate you gain.</P>
<p><b>Using NTFS File Security Features</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;NTFS file security lets you change settings for disk drives, folders, and even files. These features can be useful if your machine stores many files that you share with other users on your network as well as your private files.</P>
<p>If multiple users share a single workstation, issues of security and file access can be local to that machine. NTFS attributes dictate Permission, Auditing, and Ownership properties, but these issues relate more to using Windows 2000 on a network. (For information on these attributes, see Chapter 19, &#147;Living with Windows 2000&#146;s Strict Security.&#148;)</P>
<p><b>Scanning for Bad Sectors</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Windows 2000 doesn&#146;t have a ScanDisk utility as DOS and Windows 9<i>x</I> do, you can still scan a disk for bad sectors. If you&#146;re having trouble reading files from a disk, these files may be on a part of the disk that has bad sectors. You can scan a disk for bad sectors by using the Disk Administrator or by right-clicking the drive icon and selecting Properties. Let&#146;s take a look at the latter approach:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Double-click the My Computer icon, right-click the letter for the suspect hard drive, and select Properties.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, select the Tools tab. Now you can check the disk for errors (bad sectors) or back it up. Click the Check Now button.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Check Disk dialog box contains two options: Check the first if you want Windows 2000 to automatically fix file system errors, and check the second if you want Windows 2000 to try to recover sectors gone bad. Enable both features and click OK.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 2000 now scans your hard disk looking for bad sectors and attempts to repair any it finds. This process is lengthy, so maybe plan a coffee break around it.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Close all applications before scanning a disk for bad sectors. Windows 2000 cannot perform a disk-scan if you have any other applications open because it needs exclusive use of the disk to perform its diagnostic tests.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>You may remember a program called Check Disk (named CHKDSK) from the DOS/Windows 3.11 days. Windows 2000 still has Check Disk. It will scan your disk looking for bad sectors and, upon finding them, recover readable information and write it elsewhere on the disk to a <tt>.chk</TT> file. Check Disk will also mark the sector as bad so that no new data is written there. To run Check Disk from a command prompt, type <b>CHKDSK /F</B> and press Enter. To perform the same scan within Disk Administrator, right-click the letter of the drive to check and select Check for Errors.</P>
<p><b>Using Disk Defragmenter</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 2000 has included a disk defragmentation utility in its arsenal of tools to keep your computer running well. The Disk Defragmenter tool is built in to the Computer Management console in Administrative Tools. To use it, open Computer Management and expand the Storage console tree, then click Disk Defragmenter to open the view shown in Figure 30.4.</P>
