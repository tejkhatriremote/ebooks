<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading11"></A><font color="#000077">Using Character Sets: ANSI vs. IBM</FONT></H4>
<p>Usually, you&#146;ll be using Character Map with Windows applications. However, you may have some success dropping special characters into non-Windows applications. The basic technique is simple:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy the desired characters to the Clipboard.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Display the non-Windows application in a window if it isn&#146;t already displayed.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Paste the Clipboard contents into your application using the application window&#146;s Control menu (choose Edit <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch11/images/11-06i.jpg"> Paste or click the Paste button).</DL>
<p>That&#146;s easy enough, but whether you see the desired characters depends on several factors. Here&#146;s the situation: Windows applications use the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) character set to display characters on the screen and assign them to the keyboard. This includes 256 characters, numbered 0 to 255. By contrast, when your PC runs DOS text mode or character-based programs, the computer uses a different character set called the IBM extended character set.
</P>
<p>In the United States, the ANSI and IBM sets are identical for the characters numbered between 32 and 127, which correspond to the letters, numbers, and symbols on a standard U.S. keyboard. However, the two sets differ dramatically when it comes to the other characters. For example, in the ANSI set, the British pound symbol (&#163;) is character 163; in the IBM extended character set, it is 156.</P>
<p>Here&#146;s how Character Map and your non-Windows programs interact. When you copy a character from a standard Windows text font to a non-Windows application, Windows tries to translate the character into one that the non-Windows program can display. Sometimes this works, and sometimes it doesn&#146;t. Here are the possible scenarios:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If the symbol is present in the IBM character set, you may be in luck&#151;the symbol should appear in the non-Windows document as is. For example, if you select and copy the British pound symbol, Windows translates it to the correct code for that same symbol in the IBM character set. So far so good. But what happens when that code gets pasted into your non-Windows program is up to the program. Some programs can accept any character code you throw at them. Others display some codes as expected but react strangely to others, perhaps by executing a menu command. Still others ignore all characters except the standard ones.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If Windows has no exact equivalent in the IBM character set, Windows converts the symbol to the character it thinks is the closest. Thus, a copyright symbol becomes <i>c</I>, the registered trademark becomes <i>r</I>, and so on. Again, depending on the character code after the conversion, your non-Windows application may or may not accept it when you paste it in.
</DL>
<p>By the way, Windows performs these translations on all Clipboard text you paste to a non-Windows program, not just characters copied from Character Map.
</P>
<p>Entering the non-keyboard characters directly into a non-Windows application is usually easier than copying them from a Windows application. Check your non-Windows application&#146;s manual to see whether it includes information about entering non-keyboard characters from the keyboard. If you don&#146;t find any specific advice, you can try entering them as follows:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Look up the code for the character you want to insert. There are several places to look:
<dl>
<br>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can check Character Map. In Character Map&#146;s Font box, select the font called Terminal, which is used to display text in your windowed non-Windows programs. This font includes all the characters of the IBM set, although Character Map doesn&#146;t display the first 31 of them. Again, the necessary code appears at the bottom of the Character Map window.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can usually find character codes listed in your computer&#146;s manual or your DOS manual.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can get pop-up utilities (non-Windows utilities) that display the characters and their codes on the screen. Usually referred to as <i>ASCII tables</I>, these utilities are available as shareware or freeware from many bulletin boards and shareware distributors.
</DL>
<br>
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;After you&#146;ve found the code, press Num Lock to activate the numeric keypad on your keyboard if the keypad is not already active.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;To enter the character, press the Alt key, hold it down, and type the three-digit code on the numeric keypad. Note that these are <i>three-</I>digit codes, not four-digit codes as in Windows. All Windows key codes require entry of an initial 0, the fourth digit. For example, to enter the British pound symbol in a non-Windows program, you would enter Alt+156, <i>not</I> Alt+0156. If the three-digit code starts with a 0, do go ahead and enter that.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>You can use a Windows program such as WordPad or Notepad to open text files saved by a non-Windows application, even if the files contain extended characters. In general, however, the extended characters will be represented by small solid or hollow boxes&#151;in other words, you&#146;ll lose them. The rest of your text should remain intact, however.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h3><a name="Heading12"></A><font color="#000077">Using the Imaging Accessory</FONT></H3>
<p>The location of the Imaging application within the Accessories folder belies its wider scope of usefulness. When you consider that one of the primary uses of the computer is to store, retrieve, and manipulate information, it&#146;s amazing that it has taken this long to have even rudimentary support for imaging built into the operating system. Of course, many applications fall into the imaging category and have even more functionality. However, with this capability provided within the operating system itself, the number of users who can acquire and exchange image documents quickly and easily has suddenly greatly increased.
</P>
<p>So, what does the Imaging accessory do? With it, you can scan in printed documents as images. You can view images that you or others have scanned, simply by double-clicking them. You can zoom in, zoom out, rotate, pan, and quickly flip between pages. You can add notes, redact, rubber-stamp, highlight, and place boxes around pertinent text. You can also print or fax pages. And with the built-in Send command, a mouse click is all it takes to e-mail these image documents to anyone&#151;across your network or across the Internet.</P>
<p>Imaging has become even more useful in Windows 2000, since it now has a Fax utility built in to it. Imaging becomes the tool of choice for viewing faxes that you have received, printing them, or storing them on disk for later use.</P><p><br></P>
