<h3><a name="Heading25"></A><font color="#000077">Obtaining Other Internet Applications</FONT></H3>
<p>The inclusion of Internet Explorer in Windows 2000, along with Telnet and the other utilities, gives you a good start on accessing information on the Internet. However, as you browse the Web, you will likely want to use additional client software to interact with other users or to make your use of the Web more appealing and intuitive.
</P>
<p>In the next few paragraphs we give a quick rundown of some of the types of Internet software you may find helpful and wish to locate and download. An easy way to start finding good software is to point your Web browser to any search engine page, and enter search words such as <b>Internet Windows NT software</B>. Many of these Internet applications are also referred to as Winsock applications. Thus, Winsock is another good search word. Try a search by using the words <b>Winsock software</B> and you&#146;ll find plenty of locations filled with listings of good freeware and shareware.</P>
<p>The need for File Transfer Protocol (FTP) clients has been somewhat mitigated by the ease of downloading files via today&#146;s Web browsers. However, sometimes you may wish to download several files at once or to download without opening a Web browser, and for this you still need an FTP client. Many FTP programs are available on the Web. One good freeware version is called Winsock FTP. Winsock FTP is a lot easier to use than the command-prompt version included with Windows 2000. Figure 16.11 shows the main Winsock FTP window.</P>
<p><a name="Fig17"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch16/images/16-17.jpg',562,448)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch16/images/16-17t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch16/images/16-17.jpg',562,448)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 16.11</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Winsock FTP is a great improvement over the FTP utility supplied with Windows 2000.</P>
<p>You can obtain Winsock FTP via anonymous FTP from <tt>FTP.usma.edu</TT>, in the directory <tt>/pub/msdos/winsock.files</TT>. The file is called <tt>ws_FTP.zip</TT>. You&#146;ll need an unzip program such as PK_UNZIP to uncompress the file after you download it. Winsock FTP includes a list of other FTP archives that contain additional Winsock applications. If you like Winsock FTP, be sure to check out another FTP client, called CuteFTP or CuteFTP32.</P>
<p>Because much of the DOS, Windows, NT, and Windows 2000 software on the Internet is compressed, you&#146;ll likely appreciate WinZip, FreeZip, or another such utility that lets you graphically view and extract the contents of compressed files.</P>
<p>For keeping up with Internet newsgroups, you&#146;ll want a news client, such as NewsXPress or Free Agent. These are two of several good newsreaders currently available.</P>
<p>A few <i>white-boarding</I> programs are also available, which let you and other users exchange drawn or hand-printed ideas in real time in a manner similar to using the whiteboard at your company&#146;s conference center. When a user draws on his or her screen, the other screens are all updated to show the new addition. Typically, each connected user can have a different color &#147;marker,&#148; and pictures or documents can be loaded into the whiteboard when needed.</P>
<p>Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is quite popular among many Internet users as a way to communicate in real time with other users. By downloading and installing one of the many good IRC client programs, you&#146;ll be able to type and read messages &#147;live&#148; with other users. One popular Windows IRC client is WinIRC.</P>
<p>If you literally want to talk across the network, try VocalTec&#146;s IPhone (see Figure 16.12) or Camelot&#146;s Digiphone. These and several other similar products let you talk with anyone else over a TCP/IP connection and require only the software, almost any sound card, and an inexpensive microphone. The amazing thing about these products (aside from the fact that they actually work) is their relatively low bandwidth; for example, you can be chatting with someone while simultaneously viewing Web pages with Mosaic or Netscape over even a 14.4K Internet connection. The only problem with these programs is their lack of standards, which means you can chat only with other users of the same software. Windows 2000 includes this capability with Phone Dialer, which was discussed in Chapter 12, &#147;Introduction to Communications and Using Phone Dialer.&#148;</P>
<p><a name="Fig18"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch16/images/16-18.jpg',221,481)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch16/images/16-18t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch16/images/16-18.jpg',221,481)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 16.12</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Internet Phone (IPhone) from VocalTec lets you communicate with voice over any TCP/IP connection.</P>
<p>Taking the above ideas a step further, videoconferencing applications&#151;such as CU-SeeMe and VidPhone&#151;let you send still or motion video to other users. Besides the software, you need either a camcorder (usually on a tripod) or a small camera designed for videoconferencing that perches on your monitor. In addition, you need a video capture card, typically used to convert video from a VCR or camcorder into a signal you can display on your computer monitor and also used to create movie or graphics files. For less-than-full-motion video, even a 14.4K modem connection can be used to send a few frames a second; on a faster network connection, these video-conferencing applications can meet or exceed movie-quality video.
</P>
<p>Another relatively new arrival in the multimedia-over-TCP/IP category is RealAudio. This product gives multiple simultaneous listeners the equivalent of AM-radio&#150;quality continuous (but one-way) sound across TCP/IP connections. The Deutsche Welle (national radio of Germany), Vatican Radio, Radio Canada, several U.S. AM and FM radio stations, and many individuals are experimenting with simulcasting parts of their normal radio broadcasts over the Internet. Again, the bandwidth is low enough that you can receive their broadcasts even over a 14.4K audio connection.</P>
<p>As you can see, the Internet is a virtual hotbed of new multimedia and client-server technology. By adopting TCP/IP as your network protocol, you can ensure easy expansion into a wide area network, plus have the freedom to assimilate Internet media technologies to your network, even if you decide not to connect your company&#146;s network to the Internet.</P>
