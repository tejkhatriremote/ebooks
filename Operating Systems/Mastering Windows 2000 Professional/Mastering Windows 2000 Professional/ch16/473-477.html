<p><big><big>A</BIG></BIG>s you&#146;re probably well aware, the Internet is the worldwide interconnection of computers and computer networks that permits exchange of messages, data, and files among millions of users. Windows NT Workstation upped the ante in Internet interconnectivity by including not only a Web browser and several of the obligatory Unix-style command-line tools, but also, for the first time, a built-in Web server, FTP server, and Gopher server, enabling you to turn your NT Workstation PC into an Internet information server.</P>
<p>Windows 2000 takes that a little further by including new versions of the Internet Explorer browser, Outlook Express, and of course Internet Information Services (IIS). This time, Microsoft has built in a fully featured Internet server, with nearly all of the same components that IIS on Windows 2000 Server boasts.</P>
<p>In this chapter, we discuss the various types of Internet connections that are possible and then go through the procedures for connecting your PC to the Internet. We look at Microsoft&#146;s Internet Explorer and various command-line tools, discuss where you can download great Internet software, and finish by looking at Windows 2000 Professional&#146;s exciting new Internet Information Services, which make it possible for you to &#147;publish&#148; your Internet content.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Understanding the Types of Internet Connections</FONT></H3>
<p>There are at least four common methods for connecting a PC to the Internet. The older, more limited way is as a remote terminal on a host computer already connected to the Internet. The ideal way (because it&#146;s fast) is through a Network Interface Card (NIC) to a local area network (LAN) that&#146;s connected to the Internet. The most common way is through a dial-in TCP/IP connection to an Internet Service Provider (ISP). And finally, also quite common is accessing via an online information service such as America Online or CompuServe.
</P>
<p>In the next section, we look at how to configure Windows 2000 to connect via modem to an ISP. If you&#146;re fortunate enough to have a LAN connection to the Internet, you won&#146;t need a modem and you probably also won&#146;t need to make any changes to your TCP/IP configuration.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>An Internet Service Provider (ISP) is a business or nonprofit organization that supplies dial-in or private-line connections to the Internet.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Right now, let&#146;s look at three of these connection options in a little more detail. (We won&#146;t be talking about online services in detail because they typically can be accessed just like an ISP. For specific information about their features, please consult the documentation for the online service.) To better understand the similarities and differences among these connection methods, it&#146;s helpful to know that the Internet uses a common set of rules, commands, and procedures called Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), which enables many kinds of computers to communicate with one another. To send and receive data through the Internet, you must either use TCP/IP software on your computer or move the data through another computer that converts it to and from TCP/IP. All types of connections except a shell account (remote-terminal) make use of TCP/IP protocols. Online services have been working hard to switch to the standard TCP/IP-style connection, and at the time of this writing, most online services at least offer you the option of a &#147;straight&#148; TCP/IP connection through their computer gateways.
</P>
<p>Figure 16.1 shows a remote-terminal connection. In this case, your PC uses a conventional communications program, such as HyperTerminal or ProComm, to exchange data with a second computer called a <i>host</I>, which is connected to the Internet. As far as the host is concerned, your PC is just like a terminal that does not have its own computer processor. For this reason, communications programs such as HyperTerminal are also called <i>terminal-emulation</I> programs. Unless the host is located in the same building, you probably use a modem to connect to the host through a telephone line. You may also see this kind of Internet access called a <i>shell account</I> because many host computers use a user interface called a <i>shell</I>.</P>

<p>Remote-terminal access to the Internet has advantages and disadvantages. Note that you still need a modem; however, remote-terminal access is frequently less expensive than other types of Internet connections because remote terminals usually put very little strain on a host computer, enabling it to support a large number of simultaneous remote-terminal sessions. And because the TCP/IP gateway and data caches are located on the host, not on your PC, you can use a slower modem and a less powerful computer. Of course, if your PC is powerful enough to be running Windows 2000, it is certainly more than capable of supporting a &#147;real&#148; TCP/IP connection. (Windows 2000 Professional can even be used as a host computer to connect other users to the Internet, but that&#146;s another subject in itself.) A remote-access connection generally uses a command line (such as the DOS or Unix prompt) rather than a graphic interface, limits you to the Internet tools loaded on the host, and takes a lot longer to transfer files from a distant computer because you have to relay the files through a host.
</P>
<p>Figure 16.2 shows a connection through a local area network (LAN), and Figure 16.3 shows a direct TCP/IP link through a Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) or Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) connection. The Internet tools that control such functions as e-mail, news (Usenet), and file transfer all run on your PC. If you&#146;re already connected to a LAN, connecting the whole network to the Internet is generally more efficient because a network connection is usually much faster than a modem link.</P>

<p>The advantages of a direct TCP/IP connection to the Internet are speed and flexibility. Many Windows programs provide graphical displays, drag-and-drop file transfer, and other features that are not available through a remote-terminal connection. On the other hand, TCP/IP connections are usually a bit more expensive than shell accounts, and they require higher-speed modems (<i>minimally</I> 14,400bps) or other kinds of (usually costly) data links between your PC and an Internet <i>point of presence</I>. A point of presence for the Internet is any point at which you can connect to the network. Your ISP is a point of presence. The fact is, you&#146;ll likely only find TCP/IP connections today due to the popularity of the Web and the many features offered by graphical environments like Windows.</P><p><br></P>
