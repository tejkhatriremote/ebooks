<h3><a name="Heading26"></A><font color="#000077">Installing Peer Web Services</FONT></H3>
<p>Microsoft&#146;s Peer Web Services made their debut in NT Workstation 4. Certainly plenty of great Web Server software packages are available for NT, and the Peer Web Services were not touted as being on equal par with full-featured, heavy duty servers. But it remains to be seen how NT&#146;s inclusion of Peer Web Services will affect the producers of other Web server software down the road. One of the greatest uses for Peer Web Services is to test your Web pages during development. Another possible use is to host a personal Web site on your company&#146;s Intranet.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Peer Web Services (PWS) are actually a limited version of Microsoft&#146;s Internet Information Server (IIS). In this case <i>limited</I> refers only to the number of inbound connections the server can support. PWS is limited to 10 inbound connections (the same as Windows NT Workstation). When you are ready to upgrade to newer versions of PWS, you apply exactly the same files used to upgrade IIS on NT Server.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Windows 2000 Professional includes Internet Information Services (IIS), which are identical to the services included in Windows 2000 Server, except that they are limited in the number of inbound connections that will be accepted. The services provided in IIS include the following:
</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Server</B>
<dd>Provides the ability to act as an FTP server to receive or distribute files through the File Transfer Protocol.
<dt><b>FrontPage 2000 Extensions</B>
<dd>This service enables you to manage your Web sites using Microsoft&#146;s FrontPage 2000 or Visual InterDev authoring tools. With these extensions installed you can easily publish your Web content directly from the authoring tool to the Web server.
<dt><b>Personal Web Manager</B>
<dd>This tool gives you a graphical interface to manage your Web site on Windows 2000 Professional.
<dt><b>Simple Message Transport Protocol (SMTP)</B>
<dd>This gives Windows 2000 Professional the ability to act as a workgroup Internet mail server. Install this service if you want to use Outlook Express to send and receive e-mail within your workgroup.
<dt><b>Visual InterDev Remote Application Deployment Support</B>
<dd>Enables the deployment of custom applications from your Web server.
<dt><b>World Wide Web (WWW) Server</B>
<dd>Enables you to publish pages using the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), or Active Server Pages (ASP).
</DL>

<p>Included with the Web server are several great-looking demo Web pages. Interestingly enough, the documentation for Peer Web Services is also presented as a set of Web pages, which you can view from any Web browser. Of course after the Web server is operational, you can even view this documentation from other stations on the network (assuming you are on a network).
</P>
<p>As an aside, Microsoft announced a while ago that all their Help files are converting to HTML format. This has been implemented in Windows 2000, and has resulted in a much more convenient Help tool. When you consider how much easier HTML files are to create than Windows Help files, and how much more formatting and richness of graphics and other content can be incorporated using HTML, this is certainly a step forward and a welcome example of how everyone can benefit by adopting a well-designed and open standard.</P>
<p>Without further ado, let&#146;s get IIS installed and running!</P>
<p>To Install the Internet Information Services, do the following:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Go into Control Panel and start the Add/Remove Programs applet.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Add/Remove Windows Components to start the Windows Components Wizard.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Next to proceed to the second page of the wizard where you can select from the list of Windows components to install. Highlight Internet Information Services and click the Details button. The Details page for Internet Information Services is displayed in Figure 16.13.
<p><a name="Fig19"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch16/images/16-19.jpg',449,344)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch16/images/16-19t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch16/images/16-19.jpg',449,344)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 16.13</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The details for the Internet Information Services enable you to select individual services to install.</P>
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the individual services you wish to install and click OK when you are satisfied. You can easily add or remove them later if you change your mind.
<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Back on the Windows Components page, click Next to install the files for IIS.
<dd><b>6.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Configuring Components page displays a progress bar as the files are copied into place and the Registry is updated. You may be prompted to provide the CD-ROM if the system needs a file that was not pre-copied to the hard drive during installation.
<dd><b>7.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the file copy is complete, click Finish to exit the wizard. Click Close on the Add/Remove Programs applet to close it. IIS is now installed on your computer.
</DL>
<p>When your system restarts, click Start <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch16/images/16-15i.jpg"> Settings <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch16/images/16-16i.jpg"> Control Panel <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch16/images/16-17i.jpg"> Administrative Tools, then double-click Internet Information Services. This application lets you start and stop (or pause and resume) Web and FTP servers on your system and on any other Windows 2000 systems to which you have been given Web-services administration access. It also lets you view and change service settings, logs of service activity, and directories used by each service.</P>
<p>If any of your services are not currently running (particularly the Web service), try starting them. You can easily do this by single-clicking a particular service and pressing the VCR-style play button (or by right-clicking the service to bring up a pop-up menu, and then selecting Start). After you get the Web server service running, try launching your Web browser. In the browser&#146;s URL space, simply type the computer name for your station. No slashes or www&#146;s are necessary. Press Enter, and the default page for your new Web peer server should be displayed. There will likely be a link to the online Peer Web Services documentation. Be sure to look at this. It is quite well done and covers everything from installation to security.</P><p><br></P>
