<p>The security issue, by the way, is definitely an area for your immediate attention. If you want to enable any of these Internet Information Services, you&#146;ll want to become thoroughly versed in how the various Windows 2000 security features mesh with the new security features supported by the Web, SMTP, and FTP services. Rest assured there is no skimping on the types of security restrictions you can apply. In addition to the NTFS file restrictions, and the user and user group restrictions that are part of Windows 2000, you&#146;ve also got the ability to exclude by IP address and by individual Web and FTP user account. And if that isn&#146;t enough, there&#146;s also support for various types of encryption keys and built-in secure Web services. The default security settings allow anonymous access for all users, and you may want to change this depending on your particular needs.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The FTP protocol does not use any form of encryption when transmitting passwords. If you require users to log on with their Windows 2000 domain user account and password, the credentials will be sent across the network in clear text. Anyone with a network analyzer can capture the information. Consult your network administrator for details on your company&#146;s policies regarding network security. The option to allow only anonymous access will require that the anonymous user account be used. This prevents someone from logging on to your FTP server using their domain credentials.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Note also that these Internet Information Services are <i>services</I> in the NT sense of the word, which means that they&#146;re able to start automatically when your Windows 2000 Professional workstation starts up, irrespective of whether someone actually sits down and logs in to the workstation. This means the Web, FTP, and other services can be up and running, even though the workstation looks pretty inactive because only the logon prompt dialog box is visible.</P>
<p>When you install the Internet Information Services, a batch of new Performance Monitor &#147;counters&#148; gets installed also. Thus you can start up the Performance Monitor and view just about every Web server metric you can think of. For the FTP server, for example, you can configure Performance Monitor to display total bytes sent and received per second or overall, total current anonymous (and not anonymous) connections, total files sent and received, and total connection and logon attempts.</P>
<p>Check out the new Personal Web Manager (PWM) tool for performance statistics. This tool, shown in Figure 16.14 below, gives you direct access to the Web service and a graphical view of the server&#146;s load. The Personal Web Manager main window shows a graph of hits per day, and a breakdown of the performance.</P>

<p>PWM enables you to manage your local Web service, but to control the Web service on another computer, you will need the IIS snap-in of the management Console, also located in Administrative Tools.

<h3><a name="Heading27"></A><font color="#000077">Summary</FONT></H3>
<p>In this chapter, we have covered the necessary steps to connect your Windows 2000 Professional computer to the Internet. We discussed various Internet utilities included with Windows 2000 Professional, including Internet Explorer and Internet Information Services.
</P>
<p>You&#146;ve now learned pretty much all you need to know to work with Windows 2000 Professional as a user. The remaining parts of this book are addressed primarily to network administrators. Part IV begins with a more nuts-and-bolts, hardcore look at Windows 2000 and its architecture.</P><p><br></P>
