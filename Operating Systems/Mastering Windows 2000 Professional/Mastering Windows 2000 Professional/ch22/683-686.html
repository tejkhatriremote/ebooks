<h3><a name="Heading11"></A><font color="#000077">Basic Requirements: Hardware, Software, and Connections</FONT></H3>
<p>Okay, you&#146;re convinced. Your office is never going to enter the 21st century unless you have a network up and running. What, then, do you need to make a network?
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading12"></A><font color="#000077">Network Interface Cards</FONT></H4>
<p>The Network Interface Card (NIC), or the adapter card, is a card that you use to connect your workstation to the file servers or to other workstations. You need to be aware of various components of a Network Interface Card:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Base I/O address
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct memory access (DMA) chips
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Interrupt request (IRQ) settings
</DL>
<p>How you connect your computers will depend on the type of topology you are using&#151;specifically, peer-to-peer versus client-server. (These are discussed in the next chapter.) Also, the card will probably be cable-specific, that is, it may need to use coaxial cable, 10/100BaseT, or fiber-optic cable, depending on the card.
</P>
<p>You can find more details about adapter cards in the section &#147;Specifics: The Network Interface Card.&#148;</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading13"></A><font color="#000077">Cabling Systems</FONT></H4>
<p>Copper wire or fiber-optic cable connects the nodes on a LAN. Planning is essential to implementing a successful LAN design, and one of the most important parts of your planning is your cabling. What kind of physical and logical topologies do you want to use in your network? What kind of cable fits into your budget and fulfills your transmission needs? What kinds of connectors will you need to put it all together?
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading14"></A><font color="#000077">Topologies</FONT></H4>
<p>If you were to draw a blueprint of where all the computers were located in your network and how the cable was run throughout the building to attach all the computers of your network, you would be looking at the <i>physical topology</I> of your network. Examples of physical topologies are bus, ring, and star.</P>
<p>If you have heard the terms <i>Ethernet</I> or <i>Token Ring,</I> then you have been introduced to logical topologies. Each kind of logical topology is usually associated with a particular physical topology, but the physical topology may not necessarily look anything like the logical one. This distinction is important because it will help determine what type of Network Interface Card you will need to purchase and how much money you will spend on your network.</P>
<p>We discuss both types of topologies in much more detail in Chapter 23, &#147;Network Architectures.&#148;</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading15"></A><font color="#000077">Servers</FONT></H4>
<p>Even with the growing popularity of peer-to-peer networks, client-server networks are more common by far. Therefore, you have to think about the computers that will run your network. How fast do they need to be? Which network operations can you run from a server and which need to be located at the individual workstations?
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading16"></A><font color="#000077">Network Operating Systems</FONT></H4>
<p>After you&#146;ve chosen your LAN&#146;s topology and setup, you need to start thinking about what kind of operating system best fits your needs and your cabling plan. Will you need one of the client-server operating systems, such as Banyan VINES or NetWare, or does your LAN design require no more than LANtastic, which is a peer-to-peer operating system?
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading17"></A><font color="#000077">Network-Based Applications</FONT></H4>
<p>You&#146;ve got a LAN and an operating system. Now you need something to do with it. You might say the network world is divided into four kinds of applications: LAN-dependent, LAN-aware, LAN-unaware, and LAN-hostile.
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>LAN-dependent</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Comprises the entire field of groupware. Groupware relies upon the existence of networks in order to work. Here are some examples:
<dl>
<br>
<dd><b>For Comment</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A word processor that enables an entire group to circulate a document that&#146;s, well, for comment. Each person&#146;s comments appear in a different color.
<dd><b>Lotus Notes</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A kind of combination scheduler/mail/word processor system. Its rather steep price means that Lotus Notes isn&#146;t something you&#146;ll run into at every mom-and-pop shop, but it has a strong following among the Fortune 500. Most Lotus Notes-like systems require a LAN.
<dd><b>Any e-mail system</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;E-mail systems enable you to send and receive messages from multiple users on a network. They can be confined to your network or connected to the Internet. This can be very helpful if there are many users on your network. Sending messages to yourself gets dull after a while.
</DL>
<br>
<dd><b>LAN-aware</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Comprises applications that work fine without a LAN but have more features when connected to a network. For example, Windows will offer more features if you start it when your network is active. Similarly, IBM&#146;s For Comment can interact with other PCs on a LAN, if the LAN exists, or it can communicate with Lotus Notes over a network.
<dd><b>LAN-unaware</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Comprises most word processors, spreadsheets, and games, and is the status of most applications. To LAN-unaware applications, the network looks like no more than another physical hard drive. Rather than having just a C drive and perhaps a D drive, the network can add drives up to Z if you like. These applications don&#146;t care whether they run on a LAN or not.
<dd><b>LAN-hostile</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Comprises applications that directly address the disk&#146;s hardware. They are dangerous in combination with networks. They work fine on local drives&#151;that is, on drives directly attached to the PC. If you use them on network drives, however, these programs either terminate (that&#146;s the good news) or trash the local drive (that&#146;s the bad news). Be careful with housekeeping programs if you&#146;re working on a network. Examples of programs that may be LAN-hostile include the following:
<dl>
<br>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;SpinRite (Gibson Research)
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Norton (Symantec)
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mace Utilities
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;PC Tools (Central Point)
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;OpTune
</DL>
<br>
</DL>
