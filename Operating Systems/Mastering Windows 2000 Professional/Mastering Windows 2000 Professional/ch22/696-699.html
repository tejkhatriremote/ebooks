<p>Coaxial cable, often referred to as BNC cable (the initials refer to the Bayonet-Naur Connector&#151;a bayonet-shaped connector for thin coaxial cables), is made of a single copper wire encased in insulation and then covered with a layer of aluminum or copper braid that protects the wire from outside interference. If you need more bandwidth and noise protection than twisted-pair can provide, but can&#146;t afford fiber-optic, coaxial cable is the way to go.
</P>
<p>Coaxial cable has four parts:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>Inner conductor</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A central wire
<dd><b>Dielectric</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A layer of insulation that surrounds the inner conductor
<dd><b>Shield</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A layer of foil or metal braid that covers the dielectric
<dd><b>Jacket</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A final layer of insulation
</DL>
<p>You can see a drawing of coaxial cable in Figure 22.4 and a coaxial cable with a connector in Figure 22.5.

<p>Coaxial cable operates on the same theory that twisted-pair does: If you surround a conducting wire with another conductor, the second conductor protects the first from electrical interference. Whereas twisted-pair expects the wires to protect each other, coaxial cable dedicates a part of the cable just to insulating the inner conductor so that it can neither pick up outside signals nor broadcast its own. Because the inner conductor that is doing the transmitting is encased by the shield, it can neither transmit nor receive RF signals and is thus prevented from either interfering with other network cables or being slowed down by rogue RF signals. All coaxial cable is shielded cable by design. Its better protection also enables it to extend farther than twisted-pair cable can, because signal deterioration is one of the key factors that determines how far a cable can extend.
</P>
<p>Four varieties of coaxial cable are available. Each is used with a different type of LAN:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>Ethernet</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Used frequently as a backbone for large coax networks. Often referred to as 10Base5, a standard set by the Institute for Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and also called Thicknet.
<dd><b>RG-58A/U</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Used in coax Ethernet networks. Often referred to as 10Base2 and also called Thinnet.
<dd><b>RG-59/U</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Used on CATV (cable TV) and ARCnet (an older network topology).
<dd><b>RG-62/U</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Used on ARCnet and IBM terminals.
</DL>
<p>The Ethernet cable is the thickest, about .4 inches in diameter, whereas the other three (RG-58A/U, RG-59/U, and RG-62/U) are .18 inches, .25 inches, and .25 inches, respectively. Keep in mind that even though the latter three cables are roughly the same size, they are not interchangeable.
</P>
<p>Of these four cables, only two are used in LAN settings&#151;10Base5 and 10Base2. These names describe the specification of each cable. The information specified in these titles can be divided into <i>speed</I> of the cable, <i>bandwidth</I> of the cable, and <i>distance</I> a signal can be sent across the cable before attenuation sets in.</P>
<p>Let&#146;s take a look at what <i>10Base5</I> means. The speed designation (10) refers to 10Mbps; the distance measure (5) refers to 500 meters (roughly 1640 feet); and then there is bandwidth.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Understanding Bandwidth</B></FONT></P>
<p>What is bandwidth? Well, it&#146;s just bandwidth! Sorry, but this response is the one we generally get from many of our techie friends when we ask them to describe bandwidth. It&#146;s a hard concept to define in a few words but it&#146;s intuitively easy when someone describes it by example. The one thing they all agree on that you need a lot of it.
</P>
<p>To visualize the concept of bandwidth, envision a four-lane highway. If the cars represent data, then the data would be able to travel on any of the four pathways (or lanes). You could say that the highway has a bandwidth of 4. During non-rush hours, you could move along at 55MPH with no problem. But what happens during rush hour? A lot more cars are accessing the highway, and traffic slows down or comes to a screeching halt. In the same fashion, the more nodes that are accessing and communicating across your network cable, the slower the network traffic flows across the cable, or your network could come to a screeching halt.</P>
<p>Solutions?</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You could publish a procedure that says only a certain number of people can access the network, thus reducing the traffic. This idea does not sound very practical, though.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You could install more pathways for data to travel across. In other words, you could increase your bandwidth.
</DL>
<p>Two terms define bandwidth. The first is <i>baseband,</I> which designates that the data has one pathway (or lane) available for travel. The second term is <i>broadband</I>, which designates that many pathways are available for the traveling data.</P>
<p>The <i>Base</I> in 10Base5 signifies that this cable is a baseband cable with only one data pathway. Most LAN cable is baseband cable, whereas most WAN cable is usually broadband.</P>
<p>Now try your hand at deciphering 10Base2.</P>
<p>The <i>10</I> refers to 10Mbps. The <i>Base</I> refers to baseband cable. And of course the <i>2</I> refers to 200 meters; well, not exactly. When the specification was first designed, signals were supposed to be able to travel 200 meters. It was a good theory, but in practice the signal gives out at 185 meters. So the <i>2</I> really stands for 185 meters. Nonetheless, the name is 10Base2; 10Base1.85 just doesn&#146;t roll off the tongue as nicely.</P>
<p>Of course, being of better quality than twisted-pair, coax is more expensive on a per-foot basis. As you will soon discover, though, you generally use a lot less coax than twisted-pair wire in your physical network topology, so in practice it is cheaper.</P><p><br></P>
