<h3><a name="Heading23"></A><font color="#000077">Cabling Considerations</FONT></H3>
<p>Cables are the backbone of the network. All information runs through the cables, either in the form of electrical radio frequency (RF) transmissions, as in coaxial or twisted-pair cable, or in the form of light, as in fiber-optic cable. For your network to work well, information must pass through the cabling unaffected by RF noise. The noise generally won&#146;t corrupt the data but it can slow down the network considerably.
</P>
<p>Therefore, the biggest potential problem with any RF transmitting cables is that of unwanted RF transmissions getting into the cable. Here are some sources of unwanted RF transmissions:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fluorescent lights
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Large motors
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Local radio stations
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Other network cables
</DL>
<p>To avoid problems caused by RF interference, you need either to shield the signal going through the wires or to somehow make the signal indifferent to RF noise. Twisted-pair and coaxial cable take the first approach whereas fiber-optic cable takes the second.
</P>
<p>A cable plan is one of the most important and most often-neglected parts of network planning. Depending on your mindset and your budget, you may want to opt for unshielded twisted-pair, just because its the cheapest cabling available. At the other extreme, you may read about fiber-optic&#146;s speed and security and decide to use it&#151;to heck with the costs. (Given that you&#146;ve probably got a business manager breathing down your neck and wanting you to account for every penny, the first scenario seems more likely.)</P>
<p>Ultimately, however, state-of-the-art technology and cost are not the only factors to consider. You should choose your cabling system based on your networking. This section is intended to help you figure out what you are trying to make your network do and then help you select the cable type (or types) that will let you reach your goals most effectively.</P>
<p>Understand that most people do not install the cabling system themselves. They hire contractors to perform this function. However, you need to ensure that you are cable-literate so that the cable you choose will keep you in good stead over the long haul.</P>
<p>Now it&#146;s time to think about which type of cabling will best meet your needs. You need to consider several things before making any decisions:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ease of installation and maintenance
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reliability
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance
</DL>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading24"></A><font color="#000077">Cost</FONT></H4>
<p>As you may be aware, the various types of cables have very different costs. Because your cabling expenses can be as much as half of your total outlay on networking hardware, cost is not an insignificant consideration. You do not want to perform a cable installation today that will not meet your growing network needs tomorrow. Of course, the cost of cabling isn&#146;t entirely with the cables themselves. When comparing costs, don&#146;t forget to include the cost of installation and the cost of connection. For example, unshielded twisted-pair cabling is cheap, but it&#146;s used in a star physical topology (discussed in detail in Chapter 23) that requires expensive hubs.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading25"></A><font color="#000077">Ease of Installation and Maintenance</FONT></H4>
<p>The ease of installation and ease of maintenance are related to the cost consideration. The more difficult it is to install and maintain a network, the more it will cost. In the short term, you must pay your network professionals (in-house or contractors) for their time spent installing the cables. Let&#146;s consider what happens down the road.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading26"></A><font color="#000077">Reliability</FONT></H4>
<p>The more reliable your network is, the better you will like it in the long run. This is where the long-term costs come in. Although you may be able to save that short-term money and get something really easy to install, you could instead invest that money to prevent your network from slowing down or crashing altogether to the point where it needs fixing. Depending on your type of organization, network downtime can be either an expensive pain in the neck or a major disaster.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading27"></A><font color="#000077">Speed</FONT></H4>
<p>Transmission speed is measured in millions of bits per second. A bit is a negative or positive electrical pulse. If you string eight of them together, you get a byte. A byte is equivalent to one character. If the <i>b</I> in the abbreviation is capitalized&#151;MBps&#151;you are talking about millions of <i>bytes</I> per second.</P>
<p>Speed becomes a major consideration now and in the future. If your old cable can&#146;t keep up with the transfer rate of your new network, you&#146;ll need to replace it when you upgrade parts of the network, and that upgrade could be expensive. Clearly, the need for upgrades is yet another reason to plan your network ahead of time.</P><p><br></P>
