<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading8"></A><font color="#000077">Electronic Mail</FONT></H4>
<p>Electronic mail, or e-mail, is one of the most popular features of a LAN. E-mail enables you to do the following:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Send messages to other users on the network&#151;either individually or in a kind of mass mailing.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Get receipts for messages that have been sent&#151;never again will anyone be able to say, &#147;I didn&#146;t get your memo,&#148; because your e-mail system has recorded the exact time and date of receipt. Whether people <i>remember</I> the memo&#146;s contents is another matter.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Attach files&#151;text, pictures, or spreadsheets&#151;to messages.
</DL>
<p>E-mail works like the traditional postal service except that it is faster, more reliable, and doesn&#146;t require a fortune in postage. First, you write a message to someone on your network, address it, and send it. Second, the recipient of the message is notified by the mail system that he or she has new mail. (The method of notification varies depending on the mail software.) Third, your mail system notes the time that the message arrived at the other person&#146;s computer.
</P>
<p>Most mail systems are pretty flexible. You can send private messages to one person or distribute a departmental memo&#151;you control who receives any messages by the way you address the message. To make sure that your intended recipients get their mail, you can ask for a return receipt and the computer will automatically notify you of the date and time the message was read.</P>
<p>Another advantage to e-mail is that most systems enable you to attach text, graphics, or spreadsheet files to a message, just as you would put attachments on an interoffice memo. The recipient of your message can then pull up the attachment in an application and edit the information. This process is a lot like sharing files, but attaching files to messages has three advantages over just sharing files:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can attach a note to the file to explain anything that might be confusing to the recipient or to convey how important the information is.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You ensure that the recipient is getting the correct file and hasn&#146;t confused it with another one.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&#146;t have to muck around with passwords or define access rights to restrict access to the file&#151;no one on the network gets the file except the people you send it to.
</DL>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading9"></A><font color="#000077">Network Games</FONT></H4>
<p>Playing games probably isn&#146;t one of the loftier goals of your LAN, but you should be aware of it anyway. Most LANs come with a network game that enables multiple players to participate from their own workstations. Some of the most popular network games are Hearts, Chess, and Battleship, and more are likely to appear in the near future. (Wouldn&#146;t it be great to have a network version of Risk?)
</P>
<p>Playing network games is a great way to spend the day, but if your boss catches you playing Hearts during working hours, he or she is not likely to buy any excuses you might offer about getting more comfortable with the network. People often use the excuse that playing games helps them get used to the mouse. However, after three years, everyone really should know how to use the mouse!</P>
<h3><a name="Heading10"></A><font color="#000077">Networking Vocabulary</FONT></H3>
<p>Like most other specialized fields, networking has its own jargon. This list is far from exhaustive&#151;in every chapter, we introduce more words &#151;but it gives you a good starting place. Remember these definitions. We&#146;re trying to keep the jargon to a minimum (we don&#146;t like jargon either), but to a certain extent it enables us to explain things in fewer words than we could if we had to explain the concepts every time they came up. You&#146;ll also need to know these words if you do any more reading about networks:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>Workstation</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Any machine that has the capability to provide input to the network environment is a workstation, the key element in this definition being <i>input</I>. This definition includes personal computers, hand-held scanners, dumb terminals, etc. Each workstation has its own Network Interface Card (NIC).
<dd><b>Node</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each workstation, fax, printer, file server, or anything else that has its own unique address is a node. How does a node get a unique address? In a word, the Network Interface Card. The manufacturer of your NIC has placed a network address on your card that you cannot change. This permanent address is commonly referred to as the hardware or Media Access Control (MAC) address.
<p>The purpose of placing addresses on the card is akin to addressing houses on a street. Just as your postal deliverer needs to be able to identify one house from another on a street, your network must be able to separate one network device from another network device. Your network will be transporting many network packets of information from one node to another, and it wants to make sure that the packet arrives at the proper location. The Network Interface Card address identifies the destination location.
</P>
<dd><b>Server</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The technical definition of a server is a centralized depository for a specific function.
<p>All types of servers have one thing in common: They are all central locations where a specific function of the network is carried out. For example, a print server is a machine that performs the task of queuing and processing print jobs for a group of users. By creating a print server, you are freeing up the processor of the individual workstation and giving this specific task to just one machine. Likewise, a fax server performs the task of collecting fax requests, queuing the fax jobs, and faxing these jobs.
</P>
<p>The most common server is a file server. A file server is a machine that holds, manages, and secures access to files, applications, and data. It provides centralized control for and to your data and acts as a common location for your files for the purpose of centralized backup.
</P>
<dd><b>Packet</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A packet is the smallest unit of information that can be sent across a network. A packet contains the sending node&#146;s address, the receiving node&#146;s address, and the data being sent between the two nodes. The term <i>frame</I> is often used synonymously with packet, though it might be more precise to use packet for the data being sent, and frame to describe the format of that data as it travels the wire. In general, either term is correct.
<dd><b>Topology</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This term relates to the physical and logical relationship of the nodes on the network. In a nutshell, it is the &#147;look&#148; of your network. You can look at your network in two ways&#151;physically and logically.
<dl>
<br>
<dd><b>Physical topology</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Describes where every node on the network lies physically in relation to all of the other nodes and what the overall configuration looks like.
<dd><b>Logical topology</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Describes how information is passed along the network.
