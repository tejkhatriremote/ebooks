<p>What&#146;s special about this wiring system? Token Ring has the following special features that make it a good choice for many offices:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#146;s easy to troubleshoot.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It can use a smart hub (not an IBM standard, but can work with Token Ring) to remove faulty nodes from the network without disrupting transmissions.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a transmission design that ensures that one node can&#146;t tie up the network.
</DL>
<p>One of the potential problems with Token Ring is that although it&#146;s better equipped to deal with a broken cable connection than Ethernet is, if one adapter in a Token Ring network fails, so does the entire segment. This doesn&#146;t happen often, but it&#146;s a big enough pain if it does, so it might be worth the extra money to get a <i>smart hub</I>. A smart hub can tell if there&#146;s trouble and can remove the problem node from the network without disrupting traffic (IBM&#146;s standard MAUs aren&#146;t capable of this). Token Ring is also expensive to install. Because Token Ring is less popular than Ethernet, technology for Token Ring typically arrives on the market anywhere from three to six months after it arrives for Ethernet. This can be a disadvantage if your organization must always have the latest and greatest.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading40"></A><font color="#000077">Ethernet Options</FONT></H4>
<p>10BaseT and 10Base2 have the same maximum transmission rate&#151;about 10Mbps&#151;but, as always, you should remember that a lot of factors affect network speed besides transmission rate over the cable. If your network seems slow, don&#146;t blame your wiring system first.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading41"></A><font color="#000077">10Base2</FONT></H4>
<p>This wiring system uses both the logical and physical bus topologies. Using thin coaxial (RG-58A/U) cable, it connects the nodes of the network in a daisy chain.
</P>
<p>Why use the 10Base2 standard? It has two major advantages. First, it uses significantly less cable than a network using a star topology, such as 10BaseT. Second, it doesn&#146;t require a hub to operate, so you don&#146;t need to allocate room, power, or money to connect all the network nodes&#151;they connect directly to each other.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>10BaseT</B></FONT></P>
<p>When discussing the bus physical and logical topologies, we will mention 10BaseT as an example of a network type that uses a bus logical topology and a connected-star physical topology. 10BaseT is more commonly used in physical star topologies. 10BaseT is a special type of Ethernet, as it runs on twisted-pair cable rather than coax; 10Base2 is the more traditional bus-style Ethernet.
</P>
<p>By way of review, the <i>10</I> stands for 10Mbps, the <i>Base</I> stands for baseband transmissions (one pathway for data to go across), and the <i>T</I> stands for twisted-pair. Keep in mind that the distance limitation for twisted-pair cable is 300 feet without a repeater.</P>
<p>Theoretically, the advantage of the 10BaseT standard is that it could enable you to use existing twisted-pair telephone wire and thus save on cabling costs. Practically, most LAN planners find that they have to pull any other type of wire you may have (wrongly) anticipated they might need. In any case, when installing 10BaseT, consider that more people are familiar with twisted-pair than with coax, so you could save money on hiring the technicians you need. A bigger potential advantage of 10BaseT is that troubleshooting is easier than it is in a physical-bus LAN. Like the spokes of a wheel, the LAN&#146;s cables extend from a wiring closet to the nodes of the network. If one cable breaks or shorts, that node is out of commission, but the rest of the LAN is unaffected.</P>
<p>Other Ethernet cabling options, such as 10Base5 and 10Broad36, appear from time to time but are much less common than the two options described above.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>100BaseT</B></FONT></P>
<p>Because 100BaseT has become so popular, it bears mentioning here. 100BaseT is functionally just like 10BaseT in that it uses Category 5 UTP cable and works with the same topologies and similar hardware. What&#146;s the difference? Speed. 100BaseT functions at 100Mbps, 10 times faster than 10BaseT networks. It does require Category 5 UTP as a minimum, and Network Interface Cards, hubs, and routers that are specially designed to work at these speeds.

<h3><a name="Heading42"></A><font color="#000077">Summary</FONT></H3>
<p>In this chapter, we&#146;ve discussed various types of cable, wiring systems, and connector types. This chapter will not make you an expert cable installer but it will give you some ideas about how you want to tackle the job. In the next chapter, we provide more specifics about network architecture, including details on topologies and protocols, and discuss how to choose between a client-server and a peer-to-peer network.
