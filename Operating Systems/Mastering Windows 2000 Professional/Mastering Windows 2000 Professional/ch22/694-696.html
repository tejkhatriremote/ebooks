<p>Detailed descriptions of the five categories follow:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>Category 1</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The old-style telephone wire with which telephone companies wire most residences and with which they wired business telephones until 1983. It is not suitable for high-speed data transmission because its only requirement is that it be twisted.
<dd><b>Category 2</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This cable is certified for data transmission up to 4Mbps. Its specifications match those of IBM&#146;s type 3 cable: four unshielded, solid (as opposed to stranded) twisted pairs of wire for voice or data.
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The next three categories are more regulated and share the following characteristics: at least three twists per linear foot, and no two pairs have the same twist pattern. The purpose behind ensuring that no two pairs have the same twist pattern is to reduce cable crosstalk.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<dd><b>Category 3</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This cable is the lowest-rated cable that you should use with any LAN. It can transmit up to 10Mbps and is better constructed than cable from Categories 1 and 2.
<dd><b>Category 4</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;For 16Mbps Token Ring networks, this cable is the lowest-grade cable you should use. In fact, to get the best use from your LAN, you should probably consider this your minimum rather than the Category 3 cable.
<dd><b>Category 5</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;For real speed demons, this is the twisted-pair you want. It&#146;s got low crosstalk and has a maximum transmission speed of a blinding 100Mbps.
</DL>
<p>Category 5 cable is the cable that is specified in the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) specification. It is designed to work in conjunction with fiber-optic cable to provide enhanced throughput for multimedia (audio and video) networking solutions.
</P>
<p>If you&#146;ve heard all your life that UTP was unsuitable for networks, these data rates (and the possibility of using UTP as an alternative to fiber) probably surprise you. In recent years, however, twisted-pair&#146;s design has improved considerably. When Category 3 cable was specified to have at least three twists per foot, that requirement was far better quality than any existing twisted-pair. Today, high-quality twisted-pair has between 8 and 15 twists per foot and uses special plastics that improve its data rate.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The terms <i>coax</I> and <i>coaxial</I> are two forms of the same name. They can be used interchangeably.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Twisted-pair is still inferior to coax in some ways. Whereas UTP and STP can extend only 300 feet before the signal fades (even Category 5 cable), thick coax (10Base5) can stretch for 2,500 feet without a problem. However, if your network won&#146;t need high rates of data transfer (needed for video, audio, and large graphics files) and you can keep the wires away from areas prone to electrical interference, UTP could suit you just fine. Twisted-pair is cheaper than coax and fiber-optic, and it requires less sophisticated installation techniques. Twisted-pair will work fine so long as you don&#146;t ask it to do more than it&#146;s capable of.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you&#146;re installing Category 5 twisted-pair cabling to speed up your network to 100Mbps, you should realize that you need a Category 5 rating end-to-end. In other words, all your connectors along that wire must also be rated at Category 5.<hr></FONT>

<table border="2" bordercolor="#0000" align="CENTER">
<tr><td><font size="+1"><b>Cable Crosstalk</B></FONT>
<p>Crosstalk occurs when electrical signals move across several wires that are close together. As we discussed earlier, cables are just long antennas. As the signals go across the cable, they create radio frequency noise. If the noise is too loud, then a cable nearby can pick up the signal. If you have ever driven between states, you probably noticed that as your favorite radio station faded out, a new one started to fade in. For an interval, you could hear both radio stations simultaneously. That&#146;s crosstalk. (And you thought it was just annoying static noise.)
</P>
<p>The more twists per foot you have in a cable, the greater protection you have against crosstalk. By varying their twist pattern (one pair has 3 twists per foot and another pair within the same case has 3<img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch22/images/22-01i.jpg"> twists per foot), you are also providing greater protection against crosstalk.</P>
