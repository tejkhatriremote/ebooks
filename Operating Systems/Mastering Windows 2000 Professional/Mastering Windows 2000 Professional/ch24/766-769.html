<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading24"></A><font color="#000077">Installation of Services</FONT></H4>
<p>Installing services and clients is the last step in the three-step process of configuring your workstation. The order in which the services are installed in the Services window is irrelevant because they will always appear in alphabetical order and not in their installation order.
</P>
<p>If the service that is being installed is from a third-party vendor, choose the Have Disk option, select the location of the software (floppy disk, hard drive, or network location) and click OK.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading25"></A><font color="#000077">Services Hierarchy</FONT></H4>
<p>More and more of us are working in a multiple-protocol environment. Sometimes we can locate resources on the network quickly and other times we are waiting for what seems an eternity to get a response. Sometimes we wait because we sent a network request down the Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) transport protocol, when it should be handled by TCP/IP. We then wait for our system to time out on the IPX stack before it will try the TCP/IP stack.
</P>
<p>You can use the Advanced Settings option on the Advanced menu of the Network and Dial-Up Connections window to change the order of protocols for each service.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading26"></A><font color="#000077">Bindings</FONT></H4>
<p>The final settings to adjust would be the network binding order, which can be reached through the Advanced Settings option of the Advanced menu of Network and Dial-Up Connections. Before we begin to examine the bindings settings, though, let&#146;s take a look at what a <i>binding</I> is.</P>
<p>Your workstation can support many protocols simultaneously. (Fear not! We are not revisiting the entire protocol picture.) But note that you can access the network by going through the NetWare redirector, through the Internetwork Packet Exchange/ Sequenced Packet Exchange (IPX/SPX) protocol, through the Network Device Interface Specification (NDIS) protocol, or through the NIC driver to get to the network adapter. Any of these would be, indeed, a valid way for data to flow out from your system, and therefore would be a valid binding.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>A binding is a <i>valid</I> network protocol path by which data can flow to and from computer systems.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>On the other hand, using the Microsoft redirector (which is launched by the Net Start command for Windows for Workgroups machines and is loaded automatically in Windows 9<i>x</I> and NT) to talk across the IPX stack would be a completely different binding.</P>
<p>Your computer system does not deal in negatives when it comes to bindings. Your system keeps track of the valid paths on which data can flow. If it is your intent to have the Microsoft client talk to IPX, you will have to bind the MS Client software to the IPX protocol. You can handle this through the Advanced menu of the Network and Dial-Up Connections window, as seen in Figure 24.12. When Windows 2000 networking is installed, bindings are automatically created for every possible path through protocols and network clients to each network card.</P>

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading27"></A><font color="#000077">Identification</FONT></H4>
<p>To change your computer&#146;s identification on the network, you would either double-click the System icon in Control Panel or right-click My Computer and choose Properties. The Network Identification tab is where you can make the connection to a Microsoft enterprise network. You have the choice of beginning your own workgroup or joining an existing one. You can also opt to become part of a domain and register your machine as an active participant in the domain.
</P>
<p>By joining a workgroup, you have the ability to share your resources across the network with other Microsoft clients. Through this process you can provide limited security to these shared resources. If you should choose to become a member of a domain, the domain controller can control your resources centrally.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading28"></A><font color="#000077">Connecting to Workgroups</FONT></H4>
<p>From the initial dialog box of the Network Identification tab, click the Advanced button to open the dialog box where you can name your computer as well as join a workgroup. Be careful of the workgroup name that you select at this time. If you are the first one to log on to a workgroup with this workgroup name, you will create a workgroup. Otherwise, you will join one that already exists. For example, in our office we have a workgroup called &#147;instructors.&#148;
</P>
<p>Invariably, when instructors install a new machine into our network environment, no one can remember whether the workgroup name is &#147;instructor&#148; singular, or &#147;instructors&#148; plural. Consequently, our Browse list contains two workgroups&#151;&#147;instructor&#148; and &#147;instructors&#148;&#151;with a few of our computers in each workgroup.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Capitalization of the workgroup name does not matter; <i>instructors</I> is identical to <i>Instructors</I>, which is identical to <i>INSTRUCTORS</I>. Capitalization may not count, but spelling does.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Do not give a machine the same name as any other machine in your environment. Nor should you give a machine the same name as any NetWare Server in your environment. Also, do not create a workgroup with the same name as any Novell NDS tree.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Connecting to Domains</B></FONT></P>
<p>If you should choose to attach your system to a domain, the process is simple. In the Network Identification tab of the System Properties dialog box, simply click the Advanced button and the Identification Changes dialog box in Figure 24.13 appears.
</P>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you are uncomfortable with the Advanced options, you can click the Change button to open the Network Identification Wizard. Simply follow the prompts and the identification changes you want will be applied to your computer.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>In this dialog box, you can select the NT domain or Windows 2000 Directory that you want to log on to. By filling in the Member Of box, you are selecting the domain where an account has been created for you so that you can access the resources of the domain. But sometimes just having access permissions to a domain is not enough. For example, you might want to take administrative control of a domain from a remote PC, such as your Windows 2000 workstation. To be able to administer a domain remotely, your computer workstation must be registered with the domain by computer name and, of course, you must log on with an administrator account for that domain.
