<h3><a name="Heading6"></A><font color="#000077">Using Share-Level Permissions</FONT></H3>
<p>Share-level permissions have been part of Microsoft networking for years and predate NT. But NT brought to Microsoft networking a whole new level of security. As you probably know, one of Microsoft&#146;s goals in designing NT was to enable you to make the data on your stand-alone workstation as secure from intruders as the data on your network. In fact, you can set up an NT workstation so that multiple people can share the computer yet be unable to access each other&#146;s data. If Joe and Jane share an NT Workstation machine&#151;perhaps Joe works the day shift and Jane the night shift&#151;then it&#146;s possible to create a directory called Joe and make Jane unable to access that data for love or money, and likewise Jane can have a directory that only she can get to. This scenario is not about networking&#151;just one computer being shared by two people.
</P>

<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The default shared folder permission in Windows 2000 is for the Everyone group to have Full Control. In a secure environment, be sure to remove this permission before assigning specific permissions to users and groups.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The capability to restrict access to data is a really great feature of NT and Windows 2000. Prior to NT, our experience with operating systems of all kinds has been that if you can gain physical access to a computer, then you can get to its data; before NT, the only way to secure data with any confidence was to put the data on a server and put the server behind a locked door.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Network security is only as good as you make it. If a person can gain physical access to your machine, they can remove your hard disk and have all your data. Data security includes educating users to protect passwords and to apply permissions responsibly.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>This ability to attach security information to areas of a disk under Windows 2000 is called <i>file and directory permissions</I>. Notice that Windows 2000 lets you put file and directory permissions on disk areas even if you&#146;ve not shared those disk areas. As shared directories are protected by share-level permissions and <i>all</I> directories are protected by file and directory permissions, file and directory permissions are, then, an extra layer of fine-tuned security for network shares.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>You need to remember an important detail about using file and directory permissions: You must format a disk volume to NTFS in order to use the permissions.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Select the Sharing tab, click Permissions, and then click Add to display the Select Users, Computers, or Groups dialog box, shown in Figure 24.2, where you can select which groups have access to a shared directory.

<p>Right-click a file, choose Properties, and then click Security and Permissions. Notice in Figure 24.3 the access type is Full Control. Table 24.2 lists the three levels of share access, some of which are also seen in Figure 24.3.

</TABLE>
<p>If you look at Table 24.2, you&#146;ll probably wonder what the difference is between Change and Full Control. We <i>will</I> explain it, but first we have to explain the concepts of <i>file and directory permissions,</I> which we&#146;re going to get to in a few pages. Put simply, however, the difference between Change and Full Control is that someone with Full Control can change file and directory permissions and take ownership of a file. Oh, by the way, changing permissions is relevant only on a partition formatted as NTFS, because you need NTFS to set file and directory permissions. The FAT file system does not have any support for security built in. The only security available for FAT is through share permissions.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading8"></A><font color="#000077">Types of File and Directory Permissions</FONT></H4>
<p>Share-level permissions determine who can access resources across the network and the type of access they will have. However, you can still assign more detailed permissions to the directories and files that can be accessed through the share. In addition, by using file- and directory-level permissions, you can restrict access to resources even if someone logs on to the system.
</P>

<table border="2" bordercolor="#0000" align="CENTER">
<tr><td><font size="+1"><b>Multiple Groups Accumulate Permissions</B></FONT>
<p>You might have one group in your network called Accountants and another called Managers, and they might have different permission levels&#151;for example, the Accountants might be able to only read the files, and the Managers might have Change access, which is just NT-speak for Read and Write access. What about the manager of the Accounting department, who belongs to both the Managers and the Accountants groups&#151;does he have Read access or does he have Change access?
</P>
<p>In general, your permissions to some network resource <i>add up&#151;</I>so if you have Read access from one group and Change from another group, then you end up with Read <i>and</I> Change access. However, because Change access completely <i>includes</I> all the things that you can do with Read access, there&#146;s no practical difference between having Read and Change and having only Change access.</P>
