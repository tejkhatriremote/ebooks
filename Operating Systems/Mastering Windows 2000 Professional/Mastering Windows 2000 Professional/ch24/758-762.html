<p><font size="+1"><b>Base I/O Address</B></FONT></P>
<p>The <i>base input/output address</I> is the memory area that holds the information that needs to be manipulated. The best way to visualize the function of a base I/O address is to imagine the layout of your kitchen cupboards. Suppose you store your Tupperware containers in the cupboard above and to the right of the kitchen sink. If someone asks you for a Tupperware dish, you know exactly where to look.</P>
<p>The same holds true for the base I/O address for your NIC. When packets are sent to your NIC, the CPU needs to know where to find the packet&#151;at the base I/O address.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Bus-Mastered Network Interface Cards</B></FONT></P>
<p>Before we conclude our discussion of DMA, we must introduce a special type of NIC known as a <i>Bus-Mastered Interface Card</I>. A Bus-Mastered card is a card that has a DMA chip on the card itself. In 1989 IBM introduced some of the first Bus-Mastered cards. IBM asserted that by putting the DMA chip on the card itself, the card could process and perform DMA transfers faster than the two DMA chips on the motherboard&#151;and IBM was right. With its own DMA chip, a Bus-Mastered card is capable of sending data to and receiving it from RAM without additional processing intervention by the CPU. As soon as you put a DMA chip on any card, you have a Bus-Mastered card.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The card sitting in the BUS slot controls&#151;that is, it <i>masters&#151;</I>its own DMA transfer; hence the name, Bus-Mastered.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>We have all driven behind cars that have little yellow signs with slogans such as Baby on Board. Well, as soon as you go to your nearest computer store and pick up a card that says Bus-Mastered, a little yellow sign that says DMA Chip on Board should pop into your mind.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Software Configurable Network Interface Cards</B></FONT></P>
<p>As we leave this section, we thought it would be a good idea to provide a list of some NICs that are software configurable, meaning that setting their IRQs, DMAs, and base I/O addresses is as easy as running a software routine. If you are new to setting up networks or are looking for an easier way to install your network, using software-configurable NICs is the way to go. Although there are many available on the market today, here&#146;s a short list:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Intel Ether Express Card
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Intel Token Express Card
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The 3Com EtherLink III Card (3C5X9)
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest cards from Thomas-Conrad
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest cards from Hewlett-Packard
</DL>
<p>Let&#146;s look at an example of hardware resources settings in System Information. This tool is reached most easily by typing <tt><b>winmsd</B></TT> at the Run prompt, but you can also reach it through the Computer Management console in Administrative Tools. System Information is a useful tool for discovering what resources are in use on your computer. As you can see in Figure 24.8, our NIC (3Com 3C562) is using IRQ3 (EE16 is the Intel EtherExpress card&#151;16 bit). If you were installing a new card, you could go to System Information and see what IRQs were currently in use to determine that your NIC was sitting at one of the available IRQs. As you install your NIC, remember that in most cases you will have to set the NIC through the manufacturer&#146;s software routine, jumper pins, or DIP switches and then tell Windows 2000 what the card settings actually are.</P>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Although System Information is a great one-stop-shopping place for the system configuration information, don&#146;t forget about Device Manager. Windows 2000 is a Plug-and-Play operating system, and all of the hardware information it has will also be displayed in Device Manager.<hr></FONT>

<p><font size="+1"><b>NIC Settings</B></FONT></P>
<p>When working with Windows 2000 Professional, you may need to specify the proper NIC settings. You may have to run a diagnostic utility that came with the NIC to determine this information. After you know the IRQ and base I/O port address, you will need to let Windows 2000 in on the secret by opening the Control Panel, double-clicking the Add/Remove Hardware icon, and selecting the Adapters tab. By double-clicking the NIC, you will see an NIC dialog box similar to the one below.
</P>
<p><a name="Fig9"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch24/images/24-09.jpg',404,448)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch24/images/24-09t.jpg"></A></P>
<p>From this dialog box you tell Windows 2000 the information it needs to know about your Network Interface Card. You can set the IRQ, DMA, and base I/O addresses for your NIC in three ways:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can set jumper pins that sit on the card.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can set DIP switches that sit on the card.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can set the IRQ and DMA for some cards via software.

<h3><a name="Heading18"></A><font color="#000077">Specifying Protocols</FONT></H3>
<p>To install or configure network protocols you need to first open the Network and Dial-Up Connections window. You can do this a couple of different ways. First, you can use the Start menu by clicking Start <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch24/images/24-02i.jpg"> Settings <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch24/images/24-03i.jpg"> Network and Dial-Up Connections. The second way is to right-click My Network Places and choose Properties from the context menu.</P>
<p>Network and Dial-Up Connections will contain at least two icons after you&#146;ve installed a network. It will have an icon for the Make New Connection Wizard, which will help you to create a new network or dial-up connection, and an icon for your Local Area Connection. Right-click this last icon and select Properties to display the dialog box shown in Figure 24.9. This Properties sheet has only one tab, the General tab, which gives you access to everything you need to configure this network connection.</P>

<p>To add additional protocols, press the Install button and choose Protocol as the type of component to install. Figure 24.10 shows the list of protocols that are provided in Windows 2000, and the Have Disk option that enables you to install a third-party protocol. The initial list of protocols displays Microsoft-provided drivers. If you need support for an additional protocol, such as Banyan Vines or UNIX drivers, you need to get drivers that are designed for Windows 2000 from the vendor of the network operating system or application. When you receive or download these drivers, you select the Have Disk option in the Select Network Protocol window, as shown in Figure 24.10, and point the system to the directory or drive where the protocol driver resides.
