<p><font size="+1"><b>Troubleshoot</B></FONT></P>
<p>This button on the Settings tab is a wonderful addition in Windows 2000. Pressing this button opens Windows 2000 Help directly to the Display Troubleshooter. This troubleshooting tool can help you find the cause and resolution for most of the common video display problems you may encounter. We highly recommend that you take a look at this feature at least once, even if you don&#146;t need it. Just knowing that it&#146;s there can be a help in itself.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Advanced</B></FONT></P>
<p>The Advanced button brings up a new dialog that gives you access to the more&#133;well <i>advanced</I> settings for the display adapter and monitor. The following sections describe the tabs of this Advanced dialog.</P>
<p><b>General</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As you may know, some screen drivers use different font sizes for screen elements such as dialog boxes and menus. When you switch to a high Desktop area resolution, such as 1280 &#215; 1024, these screen elements can get quite small, blurry, and difficult to read. For this reason, you can adjust the font size. Of course, you can do this via the Fonts settings on the Appearance tab as discussed earlier, but doing it here is a little simpler. If you select a Desktop area greater than 640 &#215; 480, you have the choice of Small Fonts or Large Fonts. Especially for resolutions of 1024 &#215; 768 or above, you might want to check out the Large Fonts selection from this drop-down list. If you want, you can also choose a custom-size font by clicking the Custom button, which lets you declare the amount that you want the fonts scaled up. The range is from 100 to 200 percent.</P>
<p><b>Adapter</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adapter tab enables you to view and change the Properties for the display adapter. If you want to change the driver, or add another display adapter to your Windows 2000 setup, you will need to visit the Add New Hardware applet in Control panel.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>As discussed earlier in this chapter, you can also change the type of video card that Windows 2000 thinks you have from the Add New Hardware and System applets.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The middle section of this tab shows the information about the currently installed display adapter such as memory installed, BIOS, and manufacturer. The final section of the Adapter tab is the List All modes button, which brings up a list of all of the possible modes that this driver and adapter can produce.
</P>
<p><b>Monitor</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This tab gives you access to the driver and settings that deal with the monitor itself. The first section of the tab shows the currently installed monitor type. The bottom portion of the dialog enables you to changes the refresh rate for the monitor.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you specify a refresh rating that is too high for your monitor, trying to expand the Desktop area to a larger size may not work. You&#146;ll just get a mess on the screen. If this happens, try using a setting with a lower refresh rate, such as 60Hz or interlaced. The image may flicker a bit more, but at least it will be clearly visible.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>There is a check box below the Refresh Frequency list box that tells Windows 2000 to hide any video mode that is inappropriate for your current configuration. This is a great idea, as setting your monitor to too high of a refresh frequency can permanently damage your monitor.
</P>
<p><b>Troubleshooting</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Troubleshooting tab includes a slider control that adjusts the amount of hardware acceleration that Windows 2000 will use. Some hardware configurations don&#146;t like the highest acceleration setting. If you are experiencing some display anomalies such as flickering, corrupted images, and mouse cursor problems. The various settings disable portions of the acceleration as follows:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Full Acceleration</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the default setting, with all performance enhancements enabled.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Disable Cursor and Bitmap Accelerations</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This setting can help resolve problems with the mouse cursor or issues with displaying bitmap images.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Disable All Cursor and Advanced Drawing Accelerations</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This setting disables the optimizations for drawing images on the screen.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Disable All DirectDraw and Direct3D Accelerations</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This setting is helpful in determining if DirectX is causing the problem with your display.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Disable All But Basic Accelerations</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This turns off all but the most basic accelerations in your graphics display.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>None</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This setting disables all graphics accelerations. If this setting solves the issues you&#146;re having with the display in Windows 2000, it may be time to think seriously about a new video card.
</DL>
<p><b>Color Management</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This final tab of the Advanced settings has to do with the overall colors that you see displayed on your monitor. Anyone remember being yelled at by Dad to leave the hue, color, and tint settings alone on the TV? These settings are basically the same as those on a TV, but they&#146;re packed into management schemes that are appropriate for your monitor. Using one of these Color Profiles may give you a much more pleasing view on your monitor.</P><p><br></P>
