<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading18"></A><font color="#000077">Changing the Effects Settings</FONT></H4>
<p>Think of the Effects tab of the Display properties sheets as a bonus&#151;in Windows 95, these same features were made available via the optional Microsoft Plus! pack, in part to assist users with &#147;legacy PCs&#148; that did not possess the resources needed to support all the video settings. Computers running with Windows 2000 are likely to have the requisite hardware; however, if yours does not, note that two of these settings (Smooth Fonts and High-Color Icons) will not function properly if your display adapter doesn&#146;t run in a mode that supports more than 256 colors.
</P>
<p>In the upper part of this dialog box, you can change the appearance of the &#147;permanent&#148; (original default) Desktop icons by clicking Change Icon and then selecting a replacement icon from another icon stash (try using the <tt>shell32.dll</TT> for lots of icons). If you later change your mind, you can restore the default, via the Default Icon button. Figure 5.20 shows the Effects tab of the Display properties sheet. The following illustration shows the box that pops up after you click the Change Icon button and from which you can choose new icons.</P>

<p><a name="Fig27"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch05/images/05-27.jpg',404,448)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch05/images/05-27t.jpg"></A></P>
<p>The six Visual Effects check boxes in the lower portion of the Effects tab provide additional visual enhancements to the shell. If you are running in greater than 256-color mode, try enabling all of them, and you&#146;ll notice quite a difference. These options exemplify the usefulness of multiple settings&#151;at lower resolutions, you won&#146;t want them, but at higher resolutions, they can make your system look great. Explanations of each of the settings follow.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Use Transition Effects for Menus and Tooltips</B></FONT></P>
<p>This setting controls the behavior of your menus in Windows 2000. You may remember one of these effects from Windows 98 or NT 4 with Internet Explorer 4 installed. If you check the box to enable these effects, the menus will appear to be animated as they unfold.
</P>
<p>You can select either the Fade or the Scroll effect behavior. The Scroll effect is the same as the behavior of the menus in Windows 98. The Fade effect is new. This effect causes the menus to fade in, and then fade out when you select a menu item.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Smooth Edges of Screen Fonts</B></FONT></P>
<p>Enabling this option requires video modes that support more than 256 colors. This option uses shades of gray to smooth out the jagged edges of certain letters. You will especially notice the jagged edges (or &#147;jaggies&#148; as some folks refer to them) if you look at letters that have rounded edges&#151;<i>o</I>, <i>p</I>, <i>q</I>, <i>s</I>, and so on. Although font smoothing does takes care of the jaggies problem, it might make your characters appear slightly blurry or fuzzy around the edges. Try it in any case; you&#146;ll probably like it.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Use Large Icons</B></FONT></P>
<p>If you&#146;ve played around with different screen resolutions, you&#146;ve probably noticed how, as the screen resolution is increased, the relative size of everything on your Desktop decreases. At 1024 or 1280 resolution, especially on a 17-inch or larger display, your icons start to look like Shrinky Dinks, and this is where Use Large Icons becomes helpful. Some applications (and the shell) supply a set of larger-sized icons, and the system makes use of these. Otherwise, the larger-sized icons are created on the fly by expanding the standard-sized ones.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Show Icons Using All Possible Colors</B></FONT></P>
<p>This option has a pleasing effect&#151;particularly with icons that were designed using more than 16 colors. The shell contains a set of high-color icons for the folder icons, My Computer, My Network Places, Recycle Bin, and so on. As time goes on, more applications will likely ship with a set of high-color (and larger) icons built-in. As with the Smooth Edges of Screen Fonts option, you must be running in greater than 256-color mode to use this option.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Show Window Contents While Dragging</B></FONT></P>
<p>This is a fun option, provided your video controller is up to speed. In addition to letting you see the full window contents while dragging, it also gives instant feedback when resizing a window&#151;no need to let go of the window to see how it will look when resized. This option works better (i.e., the windows slide more smoothly) if your Desktop isn&#146;t covered by wallpaper.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Hide Keyboard Navigation Indicators Until I Use the Alt Key</B></FONT></P>
<p>This option is an interesting new addition in Windows 2000. In Windows 95 and NT 4, you would normally see the keyboard shortcuts listed alongside the menu commands in most programs. Microsoft opted for a cleaner approach, assuming that most people don&#146;t really use the keyboard to navigate Windows 2000.
</P>
<p>This option will turn off these keyboard shortcuts in Windows 2000 so you will see cleaner menus throughout the interface. In addition to turning off the display of keyboard shortcuts, this option also turns off the focus indicators (that little dashed line that indicates the default button in dialogs). With this option checked, these items won&#146;t be displayed until you are actually using the Alt key to bring up a menu using the keyboard. After you start using the keyboard to navigate, the keyboard shortcuts and focus indicators will be turned on again.</P><p><br></P>
