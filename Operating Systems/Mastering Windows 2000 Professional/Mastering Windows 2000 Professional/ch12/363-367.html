<p><big><big>W</BIG></BIG>ill Rogers once explained that the telephone is like a very big dog; when you pulled on its tail in New York, the dog would bark in Los Angeles. Radio, he said, works exactly the same way, but without the dog. In Windows 2000 Professional, communications functions&#151;including data transfer, electronic mail, and control of voice telephone calls&#151;are all integrated into the operating system. Maybe Will Rogers would have said that the dog is now using a keyboard and modem.</P>
<p>When you first got your computer, you probably planned to use it for word processing, financial record keeping and analysis, and maybe playing some games. You would tap information into the keyboard, the computer would do its thing, and after a while, it would print the result on a piece of paper or display them on your screen. At that point, your computer was probably a stand-alone device, not connected to any other computers. If you needed to exchange data with somebody else, you could use a floppy disk to move files from one machine to the other (this technique is sometimes called Sneakernet).</P>
<p>But when you start connecting them together, stand-alone computers become extremely flexible tools for communication. Relatively early in the development of computer technology, people figured out that it wasn&#146;t particularly difficult to transfer information through a wire from one computer to another. As long as the computers on both ends use the same technical standards, you can move messages, programs, text, and data files back and forth. And when you connect a <i>lot</I> of computers together through a network, you can communicate with any other computer on the same network, just as you can reach any other telephone connected to the global telecommunications system from the one on your desk.</P>
<p>Under the broad category of communications, your PC can send and receive text, program files, sounds, and images. It can also exchange images of fax pages with a distant fax machine. This data can enter and leave your PC through a modem, a network interface card, or a direct cable connection to another computer.</P>
<p>Communications capability has been part of DOS and Windows since the earliest IBM PCs. Windows 2000 includes an extensive set of communications tools that enable you to exchange electronic mail with other computers, browse the Internet, and use your computer to control telephone calls. This chapter starts with an overview of the communications features of Windows 2000, shows how to configure Windows 2000 to work with your modem, and concludes with a discussion of how to configure and use the Phone Dialer applet. You can find more specific information about communications applications in the remaining chapters of this section. Chapter 13, &#147;Sending and Receiving E-Mail with Outlook Express,&#148; covers Windows 2000&#146;s control center for messaging components. Chapter 14, &#147;Using Windows 2000 Fax Service,&#148; discusses how to send and receive faxes with the Fax Service. Chapter 15, &#147;Using HyperTerminal,&#148; discusses how to use Windows 2000&#146;s communications program. Finally, Chapter 16, &#147;Accessing the Internet,&#148; describes how to use Windows 2000 to connect your computer to the rest of the world.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Discovering What&#146;s New in Windows 2000 Communications</FONT></H3>
<p>Windows 2000 includes some major improvements over the way earlier versions of Windows and NT handled communications&#151;it&#146;s a lot happier about sending and receiving data at high speeds, it can transfer data in the background without interfering with other applications, and it doesn&#146;t require you to shut down a program that waits for incoming messages or faxes before you try to use the same modem to place an outgoing call. In addition, Microsoft has replaced the old Terminal program in previous versions of Windows and NT with a completely new set of applications for connecting to distant computers through a modem and for sending, receiving, and managing messages, data files, and faxes. Windows 2000 also has a Telephony Application Program Interface (TAPI) that integrates your PC with a telephone system. You may notice, in the Control Panel, the Phone and Modem Options applet. This provides an interface for installing future telephony drivers, once these become more widely available. It shows the two Microsoft-supplied drivers that are installed with Windows 2000, namely, the Unimodem driver and TAPI. Overall, Windows 2000 goes a long way toward turning your stand-alone computer into a tool that can be linked to other computers and other communications devices anywhere in the world.
