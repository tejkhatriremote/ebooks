<p><font size="+1"><b>Diagnostics</B></FONT></P>
<p>The second tab is new to many NT users, but should be very familiar to users of Windows 9<i>x</I>. The Diagnostics tab is extremely useful for troubleshooting communications issues. Clicking the Diagnostics tab reveals the dialog box shown below in Figure 12.5.</P>
<p><a name="Fig5"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch12/images/12-05.jpg',344,435)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch12/images/12-05t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch12/images/12-05.jpg',344,435)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 12.5</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Diagnostics tab of the modem Properties sheet enables you to test your modem configuration, and to set logging options.</P>
<p><b>Query Modem</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This button is going to be very important to you if you plan to use a modem in Windows 2000. When pressed, the Query Modem button will send a series of commands to your modem testing its response. The first thing this tells you, hopefully, is that you actually <i>have</I> a modem and that it is working correctly. The next thing it reveals is which attention commands (AT commands) are supported by your hardware.</P>
<p>The responses to your test, if any, will be displayed in the two text boxes of the Modem Information area of the Diagnostics tab.</P>
<p><b>Logging</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Logging section is at the bottom of the dialog box. The first setting that you can control here is whether to create a new modem log for each session or to append the new information to the existing file. To add new information to the end of an existing file, check the Append to Log check box.</P>
<p>The View Log button opens the log file in an instance of Notepad. The naming convention of this log file has changed somewhat for Windows 2000. In Windows 9<i>x</I>, the log file would have been named <tt>modemlog.txt</TT>. But in Windows 2000, you may have more than one modem attached to your computer, so the name must change to reflect this. The name used by Windows 2000 is <tt>ModemLog_&lt;<i>Your Modem Name</I>&gt;.txt</TT>. For instance, a Sportster 56K modem would have a log filename of <tt>ModemLog_Sportster 56k Data Fax.txt</TT>. Quite a mouthful!</P>
<p>These log files contain information gathered while the modem was being queried for diagnostics, and any information gathered while the modem is in normal use.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Advanced Settings</B></FONT></P>
<p>Many of the, pardon the term, <i>advanced</I> settings have been moved out of the way and consigned to the Advanced tab (see Figure 12.6). This is partly an effort to shield the average user from the possible complexities of configuring a modem in Windows 2000, and partly because you just won&#146;t have to use these settings very often.</P>
<p><a name="Fig6"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch12/images/12-06.jpg',344,435)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch12/images/12-06t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch12/images/12-06.jpg',344,435)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 12.6</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Advanced tab of the Modem Properties sheets</P>
<p><b>Extra Settings</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This Extra Settings text box is for entering any additional AT commands you want to use while initializing the modem. We&#146;ve found this area useful when working with several modems under Windows 9<i>x</I> or NT, such as the US Robotics Sportster. This modem, and several others by various manufacturers, doesn&#146;t seem to like the initialization string that Microsoft wrote for it. Symptoms of this may be anything from dropped sessions to failed file transfers. The Extra Settings box can be used to correct this problem. Simply type <b>&#38;F1</B> in the Extra Initialization Commands box and click OK. This particular command tells this modem to ignore the initialization string it just received and use its built-in factory settings instead. Perfect!</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>You should exercise some caution here, though, and consult the documentation for your modem to verify the actions of the command <i>before</I> using it. If the command isn&#146;t right for your modem, this could cause some real damage to your modem.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The Extra Settings option enables you to control all of the functions of your modem, such as the speaker volume, or whether it waits for a dial tone before dialing.
</P>
<p><b>Change Default Settings</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This button takes you to a dialog box with two tabs where you can alter the configuration for your modem, including port speeds, compression, and advanced port settings. The first of the two tabs is the General tab.</P>
<p>The General tab contains settings for the Call Preferences and Data Connection Preferences. The Call Preferences section has a couple of settings that govern how the call session will be handled. The first is whether the modem should hang up automatically after it has been idle for a set number of minutes. Check the box next to Disconnect a Call if Idle for More Than <i>x</I> Minutes, and enter the number of minutes that you want the modem to sit idle before being disconnected. The default entry here is 30 minutes.</P>
<p>The second option under Call Preferences is to Cancel the Call if Not Connected within <i>x</I> Seconds. The default entry is 60 seconds. This option tells your modem to continue trying to connect for up to the number of seconds you specify.</P>
<p>The Data Preferences section contains settings that affect the transfer of data across this modem session. This section contains the following settings:</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Port Speed</B>
<dd>Sets the data transfer rate for the communications port. As a rule, set this to at least twice the rated speed of your modem to allow for modem data compression.
<dt><b>Data Protocol</B>
<dd>This controls the error correction scheme that your modem will use for sessions. The default setting of StandardEC enables your modem to negotiate the highest level of error correction that both modems in a session will support. This is usually the best setting since it allows for some flexibility. The ForcedEC setting causes the modem to use only V.42 error correction. If this fails, the call will be terminated. The last setting is Disabled, which turns off error correction entirely.
<dt><b>Compression</B>
<dd>Tells the modem to use hardware-based data compression. This usually results in faster communications, except when you are transferring large files that are already compressed. In this case, enabling hardware compression can actually slow down your session because you are trying to compress something that is already compressed.
<dt><b>FlowControl</B>
<dd>This setting controls the method used to signal transmission of data. Many programs require some kind of indication that the data sent was received on the other end. Typically, this can be done through hardware or software methods. The hardware method uses a scheme called Ready to Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS), which depends on the modem hardware to handle the signaling. The software method is called XON/XOFF, which relies on the operating system to send a signal when the modem is through transmitting. The final option is to disable flow control altogether. Use this last option mostly for troubleshooting.
