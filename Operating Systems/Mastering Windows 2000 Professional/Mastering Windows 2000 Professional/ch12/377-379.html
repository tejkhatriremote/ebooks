<p>The Advanced tab has the following settings, some of which you may recognize if you&#146;ve been using your modem for a while under older operating systems:
</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Data Bits</B>
<dd>Sets the number of bits that will be used for transmitting a single character of text. Typically, most online services and bulletin board systems use eight bits per character, though some systems use seven. It is important that you use the same setting that the modem you are calling is using, otherwise you won&#146;t be able to communicate correctly.
<dt><b>Parity</B>
<dd>Determines whether the session will use parity bits for error checking. If you are using this method of error checking, the modem will append a single bit that indicates whether the number of bits set to the value of one in a character is even or odd. This is a fairly primitive method of checking for errors, and has been replaced with much more sophisticated routines. Typically, this option is set to None. This setting must match that of the other modem with which you are communicating.
<dt><b>Stop Bits</B>
<dd>Tells the system that a byte of data has been sent. These are almost always set to a value of one.
<dt><b>Modulation</B>
<dd>This setting determines the protocol used to translate the data signals from the digital form used by computers to the sounds that can be transmitted across the phone line. Normally, you would always use the Standard modulation protocol, but if you are having problems connecting, you should try changing to the Non-Standard (Bell, HST) modulation.

<p><font size="+1"><b>Dialing Rules</B></FONT></P>
<p>This is one of the new areas in Windows 2000. Instead of Using the Dialing Properties in NT 4 to dictate the configuration of your TAPI Location, Windows 2000 uses the Dialing Rules tab of the Phone and Modem Options applet in Control Panel to make these settings. There are a couple of ways to access this information. You could, of course, either use Control Panel, or you could access this information from any TAPI-aware application in order to adjust the modem properties for the location.
</P>
<p>When TAPI was created with Windows 95, it was a great boon to people who traveled with their computers. Having the ability to set the communications settings just once and have them apply equally to all communications programs was really nice. But you probably live in an area where the phone companies have been splitting up areas into smaller geographic areas and assigning these new pieces new area codes. Having an Internet Service Provider (ISP) in another area code, yet having the call to reach them still be local, can be enough to drive you crazy.</P>
<p>Windows 2000 can help end <i>that</I> suffering by enabling you to set up dialing rules for your 10-digit dialing pleasure. The Dialing Rules tab of the Phone and Modem Options applet in Control Panel enables you to create, modify, or delete TAPI Locations. Put simply, a TAPI <i>Location</I> is a collection of the dialing properties for the place you are calling from. You will find your Locations listed on the Dialing Rules tab. The Location dialog box has three tabs. In addition to the Dialing Rules tab, there is also a tab for Area Code Rules, and a tab for defining your Calling Card.</P>
<p>To create a new Location, use these steps:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open Control Panel and double-click the Phone and Modem Options icon.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Dialing Rules tab, click the New button to create a new TAPI Location. If you are editing an existing Location, you can use the same steps except that you will be highlighting the Location you want to change and clicking the Edit button.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The properties sheet for the Location opens as shown in Figure 12.7. This is the same dialog box you would use to adjust the Locations properties from any TAPI-aware communications program in Windows 2000.
<p><a name="Fig7"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch12/images/12-07.jpg',404,448)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch12/images/12-07t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch12/images/12-07.jpg',404,448)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 12.7</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Edit Location dialog box gives you access to all of the important settings to control dialing from one place.</P>
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Give the Location a name. To do this, type a name that you will use to identify this Location in the Location Name text box.
<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Country/Region select the appropriate country. This will determine the correct country code for dialing long distance. In the United States the country code is &#147;1.&#148;
<dd><b>6.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Area Code text box, type the area code for the Location you are creating.
<dd><b>7.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Dialing Rules area of the dialog box, you need to tell Windows 2000 how to dial from this Location. If you dial a special number to access an outside line (such as 9 on a PBX system at work), enter that in the first text box. In the second text box, you can enter the number you use to dial an outside line for long distance, if it&#146;s different from the first number.
<dd><b>8.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Check the To Disable Call Waiting check box, then select the correct numeric code to disable call waiting on your phone system (if you have call waiting).
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If your telephone line uses call waiting, click the Call Waiting option to disable it. Look in the front of your local telephone directory or call your telephone business office to find out which code you need to use, then select that code from the drop-down menu.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<dd><b>9.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, select the correct radio button for the type of modulation your phone system uses to dial. This will most likely be Tone dialing, but if your phone system uses Pulse dialing you will need to select Pulse in order to dial correctly.
