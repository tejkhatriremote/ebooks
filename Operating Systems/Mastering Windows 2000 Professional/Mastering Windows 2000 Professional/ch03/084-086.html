<h3><a name="Heading27"></A><font color="#000077">Understanding Windows 2000 as a Multiuser Environment</FONT></H3>
<p>From the ground up, Windows 2000 is designed as a multiuser networking environment. Because security is so integral to the way that Windows 2000 operates, it is possible for two or more users to use the same workstation without stepping on each other&#146;s feet. That is, one user can log in and do the work he or she wants to do without necessarily knowing who else has access to the computer, or without having access to another user&#146;s files.
</P>
<p>For multiuser access to work the way it should, the system administrator needs to set up the appropriate accounts in the Control Panel Users and Passwords applet. For more information on system administration and the Users and Passwords applet, please see Chapter 30, &#147;Administrative and Diagnostic Tools.&#148;</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading28"></A><font color="#000077">User Profile Folders</FONT></H4>
<p>When a user logs on to a Windows 2000 workstation, the operating system assigns that user a security token. The Windows 2000 Security Manager portion of the Executive Services manages security tokens. Each time that user attempts to do something in Windows 2000, be it open a file, send e-mail, or change the way the Desktop looks, the Security Manager checks that person&#146;s token to see if they have the rights and permissions to perform the task they&#146;ve requested.
</P>
<p>As a result of the token-based security system, Windows 2000 administers multiuser environments logically. As a new addition to Windows 2000, the user profile information has been moved out of the Windows 2000 folder to their own folder in the root of the drive where Windows 2000 is installed. This new folder is called Documents and Settings. Inside the Documents and Settings folder is a folder for each user that logs in to a workstation (see Figure 3.7), and inside each user&#146;s folder is a set of folders that customize the Windows 2000 environment for that user.</P>

<p>These folders are
</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Application Data</B>
<dd>Contains information about how a specific user configures their applications. This folder contains settings that tell if the user runs programs in full windows, what recent documents have been used, and other pertinent information. This relieves other users from needing to see your preferences when they use your machine. For example, many programs list the files you have most recently opened at the bottom of their File menu. With Windows 2000&#146;s multiuser system, the recently opened files for one user do not appear when another user runs the same application.
<dt><b>Cookies</B>
<dd>Contains any cookies that you may have stored from Web sites. Cookies are a small bit of text information that enables a Web site to customize its appearance just for you.
<dt><b>Desktop</B>
<dd>Contains any files that a user stores on the Desktop. This does not include My Computer, My Network Places, or the Recycle Bin.
<dt><b>Favorites</B>
<dd>Stores your favorite programs, files, and Web sites. From the outside, Favorites looks like just another folder. You can add files to it and delete files from it as you would with any other folder. The difference is that &#147;Designed for Windows 95&#148; programs often have an option on their File Open dialog boxes to open files directly from the Favorites folder. Additionally, these same dialog boxes have options to <i>add</I> files and folders to the Favorites folder so you don&#146;t have to navigate to the Favorites folder manually. Microsoft&#146;s Internet Explorer also automatically stores Web page bookmarks in the Favorites folder by default.
<dt><b>Local Settings</B>
<dd>Contains a portion of the user-specific information of the Registry, as well as some personal settings for your History, Temporary Internet Files, and a system Temp folder.
<dt><b>My Documents</B>
<dd>Keeps files that you don&#146;t want any other users to access, even though the users may share other aspects of your workstation. The My Documents folder is empty by default, except for a subfolder called My Pictures. My Pictures is the default location for storing your picture files.
<dt><b>NetHood</B>
<dd>This folder contains some cached information that normally appears in My Network Places. This is where you will store the browse list for your local network, and any persistent network connections.
<dt><b>PrintHood</B>
<dd>Stores the mappings for any network printers you have installed. Network printers are actually part of the user profile, and not part of the overall system configuration.
<dt><b>Send To</B>
<dd>Stores customizations to your Send To menu. For more information on the Send To command, please see Chapter 4. The Favorites folder mentioned above is a good candidate for adding to your Send To menu.
<dt><b>Start Menu</B>
<dd>Stores configurations and customizations you have made to your Start menu. For example, it shows all the shortcuts you have added to your Start menu.
<dt><b>Templates</B>
<dd>This folder stores the system templates for various applications that can be installed on Windows 2000.
