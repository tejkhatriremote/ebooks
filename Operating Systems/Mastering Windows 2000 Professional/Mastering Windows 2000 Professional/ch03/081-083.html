<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading24"></A><font color="#000077">Dragging with the Right Mouse Button</FONT></H4>
<p>When you drag files with the right mouse button and then release the button, a menu pops up offering a special set of options to help you decide how to move the file or folder. Use the following steps to move a file or folder:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the file or folder you want to move to the Desktop.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the right mouse button and drag the object to the Desktop.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you drag the object to the Desktop and release the right mouse button, a menu appears giving you these options:
<dl>
<br>
<dd><b>Move Here</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moves the file to the new location.
<dd><b>Copy Here</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies the file to the new location.
<dd><b>Create Shortcut(s) Here</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Creates a shortcut to the file at the new location. As we&#146;ve discussed, a shortcut is a pointer to the real file or folder, and can be stored anywhere on your computer. You can double-click a shortcut wherever you find it, and it will run or open the object regardless of where it is located. (Shortcuts are what make the Start menu so customizable.)
<dd><b>Cancel</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancels the operation.
</DL>
<br>
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you are new to Windows 2000 or are confused about when to use Ctrl or Shift when moving or copying files, the safest way is to drag the file with the right mouse button. This way, you are always presented with a choice of whether to move or copy the file.<hr></FONT>

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading25"></A><font color="#000077">Renaming Documents and Folders</FONT></H4>
<p>Windows 2000 enables you to quickly and easily rename files and folders. Because Windows 2000 keeps track of file associations for you, you don&#146;t have to worry about including the three-character file extensions that you did in Windows 3.<i>x</I>. To rename a file or folder, follow these steps:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the file or folder you want to rename.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose Rename from the File menu or Rename from the right-click menu.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When only the name of the file (the text associated with the icon) becomes highlighted, do one of the following:
<dl>
<br>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to simply replace the entire name, then while the whole name is still highlighted, start typing the new name; the old name disappears the moment you start typing.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to make just a correction or two to the existing name, then while the whole name is still highlighted, use your cursor-movement keys (the arrow keys) on your keyboard to move to specific characters within the existing name. The highlight disappears the moment you start moving within the name, enabling you to insert or delete specific characters without deleting the entire name.
</DL>
<br>
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Press Enter to accept the new name or Esc if you made a mistake.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>You can also rename files and folders with two single-clicks (but not so fast that Windows 2000 interprets it as a double-click) on the name of the object so that it is highlighted, and then type the new name as described in step 3 above. Again, press Enter when you are done (or Esc if you make a mistake).<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading26"></A><font color="#000077">Deleting Files and Folders</FONT></H4>
<p>If you decide that you don&#146;t want a file or a folder anymore, you can easily delete it. By default, when you delete a file in Windows 2000, the file is not actually deleted: Instead, it is compressed and sent to a folder called the Recycle Bin. When a file has been moved to the Recycle Bin, it hasn&#146;t been removed from your hard drive, only placed on inactive duty, so to speak. (You can periodically delete items within the Recycle Bin to <i>actually</I> remove them entirely from existence, or even empty the entire Bin to delete everything in it.)</P>
<p>The Recycle Bin is a good intermediate place to keep files you&#146;re pretty sure you want to delete, because if you change your mind after &#147;deleting&#148; them to the Recycle Bin, you can always open the Bin and use its Restore option to resurrect the object. Mutter your apologies for treating the item so shabbily, and it&#146;s ready for use once more.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you&#146;re the kind of person who hates being pestered by second thoughts, and you&#146;d prefer to avoid the nice little safeguard of the Recycle Bin, you can <i>really</I> delete an item by selecting it and pressing Shift&#43;Delete.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Sending Items to the Recycle Bin</B></FONT></P>
<p>There are several ways to send a file to the Recycle Bin:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Press the Delete key on your keyboard.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose Delete from the file menu.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose Delete from a right-click menu.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Drag-and-drop the item on the Recycle Bin icon.
</DL>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Emptying the Recycle Bin</B></FONT></P>
<p>After a file has been sent to the Recycle Bin, it can be kept there indefinitely until such time as you decide to delete it from the Recycle Bin. After a file has been deleted from the Recycle Bin, the file is removed from your hard drive and is gone forever. To empty the Recycle Bin, do one of the following:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-click the Recycle Bin icon on your Desktop and choose Empty Recycle Bin.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the Recycle Bin in Explorer (it can be opened and otherwise treated like any other folder, except that the Recycle Bin itself cannot be deleted) and choose Empty Recycle Bin from the File menu.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>When a file is deleted in Windows 2000, it is really deleted. Other operating systems such as MS-DOS or Windows 9<i>x</I> delete only the first byte from a file and mark the space as available. Windows 2000 is much more thorough because of its secure nature. When you delete a file in Windows 2000, all the bytes in the file are set to a zero value. This is like formatting the space where the file was so it can be reclaimed.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Restoring Items from the Recycle Bin</B></FONT></P>
<p>To restore items from the Recycle Bin you can do one of three things:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the Recycle Bin and drag the file you want to restore to the folder of your choice.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the Recycle Bin, select the file you want to restore, and choose Restore from the File menu or Restore from a right-click menu.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-click the location you deleted the file from and select Undo Delete from the context menu.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Windows 2000 goes further to protect your data when using the Recycle Bin. There is a Recycle Bin folder on every hard drive that contains the files or folders that have been deleted from that drive. If the drive has been formatted with NTFS, a folder called the Recycler contains a Recycle Bin for every user of the computer, named by the user&#146;s Security Identifier (SID).<hr></FONT>
