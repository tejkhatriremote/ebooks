<h2><a name="Heading1"></A><font color="#000077">Appendix A<br>Understanding NT Service Packs
</FONT></H2>
<p><big><big>I</BIG></BIG>n this appendix we discuss NT Service Packs and how to use them. Even though at the time of this writing, Windows 2000 is a new operating system without Service Packs, there can be little doubt that it will eventually have them. This material will help you understand the nature of Service Packs in preparation for that time. The topics range from what Service Packs are and how to install them to troubleshooting issues related to Service Packs.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">What Is a Service Pack?</FONT></H3>
<p>If you bear in mind that an operating system is a very complex piece of software, then you&#146;ll realize that the chances of getting it absolutely right the first time are pretty slim. In fact, some people say that the only bug-free software is a computer virus: it does exactly what it was designed to do and nothing more. The rest of us have learned to live with bugs in our software. Let&#146;s not debate whether that&#146;s a good thing or not, that would be a book unto itself.
</P>
<p>Given that software today is released with bugs, or as some Microsoft people like to call them, &#147;undocumented features,&#148; responsible companies try to provide fixes for the problems as soon as possible. Microsoft has always been pretty good about this, especially with Windows NT. As customers call in to report issues, <i>hotfixes</I> are written to correct the problems. A hotfix is a software patch designed to correct the behavior of the program. Most likely, when a certain number of hotfixes have been written for Windows 2000, they will be collected together into one install package and tested thoroughly for problems. After all, the last thing you want to happen with a software patch is to create another problem.</P>
<p>Over the history of Windows NT, Service Packs have been released approximately every six months. This will most likely continue with Windows 2000, too. Please realize that most of the bugs being fixed in a Service Pack will only affect a small number of people in very specific circumstances. Which brings up the question, should you install the latest Service Pack just because it&#146;s out? Probably not. Microsoft usually recommends installing Service Packs only if they contain a fix to a problem you are currently having. Exceptions are when the Service Pack contains a security fix that might affect everyone. In that case, Microsoft&#146;s Web site would post information advising all Windows 2000 users to apply the latest Service Pack immediately.</P>
<p>Service Packs are all-inclusive, meaning that you only have to apply the latest pack to get all of the fixes contained in previous Service Packs. This prevents you from having to install Service Packs 1, 2, and 3 before you can install Service Pack 4.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">How to Install a Service Pack</FONT></H3>
<p>The installation method depends on how you obtained your Service Pack. If you downloaded the Service Pack from the Web, you received a self-extracting executable file. If you plan to install from a CD-ROM, you probably have an I386 folder (or whatever platform you&#146;re using) full of files.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Installing Service Packs is usually a safe process. However, on any important or mission-critical computer you should take the time to perform a full backup of the system, including the Registry, before installing the Service Pack.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>For the self-extracting file version, double-click the file or run it from a command prompt. This action extracts the files to a temporary folder and then begins the installation.
</P>
<p>The CD-ROM version requires that you run <tt>update.exe</TT> from the appropriate folder for your computer platform. This program begins the Service Pack installation.</P>
<p>Since the advent of Service Pack 2 on NT 4, Service Packs have had an uninstall feature that makes it easier to roll back to an earlier version. In Figure A.1 you can see the initial screen of the Service Pack 4 Setup program. Notice the check boxes, especially the one to back up systems needed to uninstall the Service Pack later. This will take approximately 40MB of space on your drive but is well worth the space. The other box must be checked, signifying your acceptance of the license agreement before you can continue with the installation.</P>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The uninstall feature was added with Service Pack 2 on NT 4 and provides a way to safely remove the Service Pack from your system. It may not remove all the changes, however. Some Registry settings may be left for stability reasons.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you have already installed the Service Pack, do not choose to back up the files for uninstallation. The only time this will work is the first time the Service Pack is installed. If you do back up the files a second time, you will overwrite the earlier version&#146;s files with the current Service Pack version, and the uninstall feature will fail.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading4"></A><font color="#000077">Should I Reinstall a Service Pack?</FONT></H4>
<p>The easy answer is: &#147;Yes&#8230;maybe.&#148; After you have installed a Service Pack on Windows 2000 you must be aware of what has changed on your computer. So far, many Service Packs have included structural changes to the Registry along with updated versions of files. If you remove the files without changing the Registry back to its previous state, you may cause the system to crash.
</P>
<p>Anytime you update the system with new drivers or applications that run as services, you should reapply the Service Pack to ensure the files are at the correct version. One of the worst problems that happened with Service Pack 2 (SP2) on NT 4 was caused by people installing the Service Pack, then later installing TCP/IP without reapplying SP2. Of course, they were just doing what NT told them to do; when they installed TCP/IP, the last thing they saw was a message to reboot the computer. This can be a fatal mistake, as it was in that scenario. SP2 included changes to the Registry that affect TCP/IP. If you install the protocol without reapplying the Service Pack, you have an incompatibility between the Registry and the files.</P>
<p>What you <i>should</I> do is say &#147;No&#148; to rebooting and reapply the Service Pack <i>before</I> rebooting. It isn&#146;t necessary to do this every time you install a program, but you should reapply the Service Pack after adding system components such as transport protocols.</P><p><br></P>
