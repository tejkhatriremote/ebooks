<p>Many people also use compression software, such as PKZIP, in conjunction with the data compression on their modems. If you have a large file, you can compress it to a smaller file and transmit it more efficiently than if you transmitted it uncompressed. This method is convenient because it enables you to send only one large file instead of several smaller files, but since it takes longer to send one big compressed file than a bunch of little ones, compression software can actually <i>slow down transmission</I>. Also, protocols such as MNP 5 try to recompress compressed files, which slows down the process even more.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Buffers (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter Chips)</B></FONT></P>
<p>Most people will want to communicate via modem at speeds that are at least 56Kbps. Fortunately, you can buy 56Kbps modems for less than $100.
</P>
<p>One minor problem with communicating at 56Kbps is that a lot of COM ports cannot handle this speed.</P>
<p>Your computer uses software to control your COM ports, and this software is located in a universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter chip, affectionately referred to as the UART chip. Now, before your eyes glaze over and you shout, &#147;Oh No! Another irrelevant techie term!&#148; fear not&#151;it&#146;s not that bad.</P>
<p>The three versions of the UART chip are 8250, 16450, and 16550. If you want to communicate with the COM port and modem, how do you find out which UART chip you are using? If you own MS-DOS 5 or higher, or Windows 3.1 or higher, you already have a utility known as Microsoft Diagnostics (MSD). Go to your DOS prompt and type <b>MSD</B>. Choose the COM ports option. The bottom line of the table will tell you which UART chip you are using for COM ports 1 through 4.</P>
<p>If you are looking for fast modem transmission, a 16550 UART is essential. Fortunately, most motherboards available today have 16550 UART chips included in their standard designs. If you have a Pentium or faster computer, you probably already have a 16550 UART controlling your COM ports.</P>
<p>If you do not have 16550 support, here are four ways to get it:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>UART chip</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You might be able to buy a replacement UART chip for your motherboard for about $20. Most of the time this chip is physically difficult to replace on the machine, so this option is not advisable.
<dd><b>Software</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some software utilities emulate 16650 support, and they work in most cases. One of the best is TurboComm, which costs about $25.
<dd><b>I/O card</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can purchase a 16550 I/O card that usually houses two COM ports and a parallel port as well as a built-in 16550 UART chip.
<dd><b>Internal modem</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many high-speed internal modems have a built-in 16550 chip.
</DL>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Local Flow Control</B></FONT></P>
<p>Another issue in data compression is local flow control. You want data to flow from the PC to the modem as fast as possible, but often the data gets to the modem faster than the modem can handle the information. To get around this problem, you can try both hardware and software approaches to controlling the local flow of information. The hardware approach is more widely used.
</P>
<p>The most popular hardware flow control method is called <i>clear to send/request to send</I> (CTS/RTS). At the RS-232 interface (the connector used in serial connections), between the modem and your PC are two signal lines called CTS and RTS. The sending modem uses the CTS line, and the receiving modem uses the RTS line. When the sending modem is ready to send data, it sends a signal through the CTS line to the PC, which then begins transferring data to the modem. If the PC sends data too fast for the modem to accept it, the modem will stop sending the &#147;okay to send data&#148; signal, so that the PC knows to stop pushing data at the modem until the modem sends the &#147;okay to send data&#148; signal through the CTS line again.</P>
<p>On the receiving end, when the computer cannot accept data as fast as the modem is passing it, the computer will stop sending a signal to the RTS line until it&#146;s ready to receive data again. Once it&#146;s ready, it will re-enable the RTS line.</P>
<p>In software flow control, control characters are embedded in the data stream. XON and XOFF are the most commonly used control methods.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading12"></A><font color="#000077">Summary of Modem Specifications</FONT></H4>
<p>You must understand the basics concerning modulation, error control, and data-compression protocols in order to get the most from your modem for your tasks. As with any hardware, the important questions that you should ask depend on what your needs will be during the life of the modem. Consider whether you&#146;ll be working with large or small files, and also the types of files that you&#146;ll be transmitting. Graphics, for example, are more data-intensive than text.
</P>
<h3><a name="Heading13"></A><font color="#000077">Selecting Hardware Options for Dial-Up Networking</FONT></H3>
<p>The most common method to implement Dial-Up Networking is via modem. We strongly recommend that you use a modem that follows some sort of standard, for example, Hayes compatibility. You definitely want to avoid modems that talk only to their &#147;evil twins,&#148; such as the high speed transmission (HST) modems that talk only to other HST modems.
</P>
<p>Dial-Up Networking also supports ISDN connections. You must make sure your telephone company supports ISDN in all the locations that you will be calling to and from.</P><p><br></P>
