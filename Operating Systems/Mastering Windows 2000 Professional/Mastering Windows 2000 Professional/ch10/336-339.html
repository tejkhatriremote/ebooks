<p><font size="+1"><b>Selecting Irregular Areas</B></FONT></P>
<p><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-36i.jpg"> The Free-Form Select tool lets you select any area of the picture by drawing a line freehand around the area. It enables you to select exactly the part of the picture you&#146;re after, hugging the edges of the element that interests you. Then the commands you use on the selection affect only that element, not the nearby dots. And if you plan to cut or copy an area and then paste it elsewhere, using this tool to select the area ensures that you won&#146;t paste an unwanted border that might overlap other items. The only drawback is that it&#146;s difficult to draw the selection outline accurately.</P>
<p>To use this tool, select it and move to the spot where you want to start defining the area. As you hold down the mouse button, draw a line completely around the area. When you&#146;re finished, Paint displays a dotted, rectangular outline large enough to contain the entire selection. This works just like the selection rectangle described in the preceding section. Again, you&#146;ll see handles for stretching the selected part of the picture. If you make a mistake in defining the selection, press the right mouse button outside of the selected area to clear it and make the selection again.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading19"></A><font color="#000077">Moving a Selected Area</FONT></H4>
<p>After you&#146;ve selected an area, the simplest thing you can do with it is to move it elsewhere in the picture. All you do is drag it where you want it to go by pressing the left mouse button anywhere within the selection (or cutout), moving to the new location, and releasing the button.
</P>
<p>If you try this, you&#146;ll immediately see why they call a selection a cutout: The selection is neatly removed from its original location, just as if you had cut it out with a straight-edge and tacked it down in the new spot. Again, it remains selected until you click outside the selection rectangle, so you can move it again or manipulate it in other ways.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>This is both a tip and a caution, depending on the results you&#146;re after. When you move a cutout by dragging it, without leaving a copy behind, Paint colors the area you cut it out from. The area is covered with the currently selected background color. So if you want to move a cutout and leave behind a colored &#147;shadow&#148; at the same time, change the background color first (<i>before</I> you select the area). On the other hand, if you previously changed the background color for an interim operation, be sure to change it back to the &#147;real&#148; background color, or you&#146;ll get a shape of an unwanted color in your picture.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>To move a <i>copy</I> of the selection, leaving the original in place, hold down the Ctrl key while you drag the cutout to its new home. Figure 10.12 shows the results of moving a copy of a selection by dragging it. You can create special effects by dropping multiple copies of the cutout along the path as you drag. See the next section for details.</P>
<p><a name="Fig18"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-18.jpg',600,449)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-18t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-18.jpg',600,449)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 10.12</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;In this picture, a selection has been copied to another location by dragging it with the Ctrl key held down. The original has been left intact.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading20"></A><font color="#000077">Sweeping</FONT></H4>
<p><i>Sweeping</I> a selection is a neat trick that deposits multiple copies of the cutout across the picture as you move the mouse. You can use this technique to suggest motion of an object or to create interesting artistic effects. Figure 10.13 shows an example of sweeping.</P>
<p><a name="Fig19"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-19.jpg',600,451)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-19t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-19.jpg',600,451)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 10.13</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeping a cutout makes numerous copies on a single sweep of the mouse.</P>
<p>There are two ways to perform this special sweeping effect. The first method is a modification of the standard technique for moving a selection with the mouse. With the second technique, you convert the selection into a brush, more or less, that remains active until you choose another tool.
</P>
<p>Just as when you move a single copy of a selection, you can do opaque or transparent sweeping. Again, the background color of the cutout and the current background color need to be the same for transparent sweeping to work as you expect.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Sweeping While Moving</B></FONT></P>
<p>To sweep while you&#146;re moving a selection, follow these steps:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you plan to do a transparent sweep, set the background color in the color box to match what you consider to be the background color in the selection.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose either of the selection tools and set it to Opaque or Transparent operation.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the area.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Drag the selection while holding down the Shift key. Copies of the cutout are made as you drag the cursor around.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>You can set the selection tools to Draw Opaque by selecting this option from the Options menu. To set the selection tools to transparent operation, simply uncheck the Draw Opaque option.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Sweeping While Brushing</B></FONT></P>
<p>In the second sweeping technique, you use the selection as if it were a Brush tool:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose the background color in the color box, choose a selection tool, and choose a setting: Opaque or Transparent.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the area.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Press Ctrl&#43;B. A copy of the selection appears on the screen, slightly offset from the original selection.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Paint with the left mouse button to sweep with the colors you see in the selection. If you paint with the right mouse button, the tool paints with the background color selected in the color box.
</DL>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading21"></A><font color="#000077">Saving and Retrieving a Cutout</FONT></H4>
<p>You can save a selection as a disk file for later use. Using this technique, you can create a stockpile of little graphics (like clip art) that you can call up from disk to drop into new pictures. Here are the steps to save and retrieve a selection:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Define the selection with either of the selection tools.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose Edit <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-37i.jpg"> Copy To. A file box pops up. Name the file as you wish.<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you want to reload the cutout, choose Edit <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-38i.jpg"> Load From and click the picture file containing the selection from the file box. The cutout then appears in the upper-left corner of the current picture on screen.<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reposition the selection by dragging it.
