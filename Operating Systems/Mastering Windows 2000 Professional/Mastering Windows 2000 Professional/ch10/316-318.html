<h3><a name="Heading10"></A><font color="#000077">Using Basic Painting Techniques</FONT></H3>
<p>After you&#146;ve created a new, empty painting, you&#146;re ready to try your hand at computer art. Feel free to play with the tools as much as you want. You can&#146;t hurt anything, and the learn-by-doodling approach is fun.
</P>
<p>You might want to sit at your computer and work with each of the tools as you read, changing colors to suit your fancy along the way. Pretty soon you&#146;ll have a good high-tech mess on your screen, at which point you can choose File <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-13i.jpg"> New again to clear it and be ready for more experimentation. (When asked about saving your work, click No unless you really like it.)</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading11"></A><font color="#000077">Choosing a Color Scheme: Basic Tips</FONT></H4>
<p>You&#146;ll get the best results if you stick with solid colors. Here&#146;s the scoop: The number of separate solid colors you can use depends on the capabilities of your display hardware and the specific software driver setting you&#146;ve chosen. A standard VGA screen can display only 16 discrete colors; more sophisticated displays can handle 256 to 16.7 million colors.
</P>
<p>Paint uses patterns made up of different colored dots to represent hues that it can&#146;t display as solid colors. These patterns tend to look murky or fuzzy in your pictures. Avoid them when possible.</P>
<p>Also, keep the color capabilities of your printer in mind when you choose colors for your picture. An image that looks great on your screen can become a blurry gray soup when you print it on a black-and-white printer. When Windows 2000 prints to a black-and-white printer, it attempts to translate colors into contrasting shades of gray (gray shades are simulated with different densities of black dots). Sometimes the translation gives you good results, but if not, experiment with the color scheme until you find one that produces a clear image in print&#151;even if the colors clash horribly on the screen. If that doesn&#146;t work, stick with painting in black on a white background.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading12"></A><font color="#000077">Setting the Foreground and Background Colors</FONT></H4>
<p>One of the most fundamental techniques to learn is selecting a color to paint with. In Paint, you control both foreground and background colors independently.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The term <i>color</I> describes either a color or a colored pattern selected from the color box. If you are using a black-and-white screen, colors in the color box may appear as shades of gray or varying densities of dot patterns.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The <i>foreground color</I>, or drawing color, is the main color you paint with. For example, when you add strokes with Paint&#146;s paintbrush, draw lines or shapes, or even when you type text, these items appear in the currently selected foreground color.</P>
<p>The term <i>background</I> <i>color</I> is somewhat misleading. True, if you select a background color just before you start a new painting, this will be the color of the canvas or backdrop for the entire picture. On the other hand, after you have a picture on your screen, many of the tools (such as the Brush, Pencil, and the shape tools) let you paint with the so-called background color just as you would with the foreground color. All you need to do is hold down the right mouse button instead of the left one as you paint. The background color also determines the fill color for circles, squares, and other enclosed shapes; the fill color inside text frames; and the color with which you erase existing parts of the picture.</P>
<p>The key thing to remember is that after you&#146;ve started work on a picture, changing the background color doesn&#146;t affect the picture directly in any way. If any of the original background color is still visible, it remains the same. It may help to understand that creating a new picture with a specific background color is equivalent to painting the entire picture with that color. There&#146;s nothing special about the background color as far as Paint is concerned&#151;a picture is just a set of dots that happen to be all one color when you first create it.</P>
<p>The current settings of the foreground and background colors are shown in the area at the left side of the color box (shown below). In this area, the box on top toward the upper left shows the foreground color. The box in back, toward the lower right, shows the background color. The default colors are a black foreground on a white background, and they always come up that way when you open a new or existing picture.</P>
<p><a name="Fig5"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-05.jpg',500,78)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-05t.jpg"></A></P>
<p>You choose new foreground and background colors by selecting them in the color box. Alternatively, you can use the Eyedropper tool to use a color from the picture as the new foreground or background color.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Setting the Foreground Color</B></FONT></P>
<p>To set the foreground color, point to the color or pattern you want and click the <i>left</I> mouse button. Now whatever you paint with the tools using the left mouse button appears in this color. Notice that the foreground color box at the left side of the color box reflects your color choice.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Setting the Background Color</B></FONT></P>
<p>To set the background color, point to the color or pattern in the color box and click the <i>right</I> mouse button. The background color box at the left side of the color box changes accordingly.</P>
<p>If you want to apply a background color to an entire picture, you must choose the desired background color, then immediately choose File <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-14i.jpg"> New to create the new picture. Note that the background color that you draw with becomes white again as soon as Paint creates the new picture. Also, note that you can&#146;t change the color of an existing picture&#146;s actual background by changing the background color with the color box.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you start a new picture with the wrong background color, there&#146;s an alternative to starting all over again. Before painting anything on the picture, choose the correct background color and click anywhere over the work area with the Paint Can tool. The entire picture area will change to the background color. Alternatively, after choosing the desired background color, choose Image <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch10/images/10-15i.jpg"> Clear Image.<hr></FONT>
