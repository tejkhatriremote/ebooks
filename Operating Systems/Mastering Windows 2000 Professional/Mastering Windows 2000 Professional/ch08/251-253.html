<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading7"></A><font color="#000077">Capturing Screens with the Clipboard</FONT></H4>
<p>As in earlier versions of Windows and NT, you can capture all or part of a screen image while running an application. Screen captures are useful for creating program documentation, software education materials, or promotional material about software.
</P>
<p>The Clipboard is handy for capturing screen images in lieu of purchasing a special-purpose screen-capture program. The price is right, and it works, albeit with some limitations.</P>
<p>Although you can&#146;t edit your files or make changes such as adding borders when using this economy approach to captures, you can save a file to disk for later use. The Clipboard and the ClipBook both let you save files to disk. See the &#147;Storing the Clipboard&#146;s Contents in a File&#148; and &#147;Using the ClipBook Instead of the Clipboard&#148; sections later in this chapter for more information.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Professional programs designed for screen capture help you organize, crop, and edit your screen captures, among other things. If you regularly use screen captures, you might want to check these programs out. Programs you might want to explore are Collage Complete, Tiffany, PixelPop, Hotshot, and Hijaak. These programs give you a lot of latitude with capture techniques, file formats, color settings, grayscaling, and so forth, which the Clipboard doesn&#146;t allow.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>With the Clipboard, you have just two options when capturing: You can capture the entire screen or just the active window. Whether you&#146;re capturing a DOS or Windows-based application, the capture is converted to bitmapped format for pasting into graphics programs, such as PageMaker and Paint.
</P>
<p>To copy the active window&#146;s image onto the Clipboard, do the following (note that if a dialog box is open, this is usually considered the <i>active</I> window):</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;With the application whose screen you want to capture open and running in a window, adjust and size the window as desired.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Press Alt&#43;Print Screen. The image of the active window is copied to the Clipboard.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Most computers work with the Alt&#43;Print Screen key combination. However, some older PC keyboards use slightly different codes, requiring the user to press Shift&#43;Print Screen instead.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Instead of copying the active window, you might want to capture a picture of the entire screen. To do this, set up the screen as described above, and then press Print Screen (instead of Alt&#43;Print Screen). The image will be copied to the Clipboard. (See the discussion below about pasting the Clipboard contents.)
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading8"></A><font color="#000077">Using the Paste Command</FONT></H4>
<p>After you have some information on the Clipboard, Windows 2000 offers you several options for working with it. (In Windows 3.<i>x</I>, only two of these were possible, but Windows 2000 incorporates the ClipBook facility that was previously part of Windows for Workgroups, so now there are three.) Here are the three routes you can take:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Paste the information into a document you&#146;re working with (or that you open subsequently).
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Save it to a Clipboard (<tt>.clp</TT>) file that you can use later.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Save it on a ClipBook page for later use or for sharing over the network.
</DL>
<p>The last two choices are described later in this chapter. For standard pasting, there are two options:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can paste information into Windows applications.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can paste into DOS applications (when they are in a window rather than running full-screen).
</DL>
<p>Let&#146;s look at these two individually because they require distinctly different techniques.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Pasting into Windows Applications</B></FONT></P>
<p>As you are probably aware, the great majority of Windows applications&#146; Edit menus include a Paste command. As the name implies, this is the command you use to paste material from the Clipboard into your documents. Of course, this command isn&#146;t available unless something is already on the Clipboard that can be accepted by the document you&#146;re working with at the time.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>To accommodate proprietary data types and large amounts of data, some heavier-duty programs have their own internal Clipboard that&#146;s not connected at all to the system&#146;s Clipboard. Word for Windows, for example, has its own large Clipboard that it uses when you cut or copy a large bulk of material. In such an application, data you thought you were making available to the entire Windows 2000 system might <i>not</I> be. But this caveat applies less to 32-bit applications than it does to 16-bit ones. You can expect the 32-bit internals of Windows 2000&#151;along with more intelligent memory management&#151;to render its system-wide Clipboard both more intelligent and larger in capacity than its predecessor&#146;s.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Here&#146;s the basic approach for pasting information from the Clipboard (there may be some variation from application to application, but the basic procedure is the same), after you have cut or copied material there:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Switch to the destination program or document&#151;the one that will receive the information.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Position the cursor or insertion point. In a text-based program this means position the I-beam cursor where you want it and click the primary mouse button.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose Edit <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-04i.jpg"> Paste or (in most programs) press Ctrl&#43;V. The Clipboard&#146;s contents appear in the destination window.</DL>
<p>The Clipboard&#146;s contents remain static until you copy or cut something new, so repeated pasting of the same material is possible. Just keep selecting insertion points and choosing Edit <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-05i.jpg"> Paste or pressing Ctrl&#43;V.</P><p><br></P>
