<p><big><big>A</BIG></BIG>s you know, you can run several applications at one time and switch between them with a click of the mouse or a press of Alt&#43;Tab. You may also know that you can cut, copy, and paste information between programs and documents, embedding bits and pieces of information, graphics, sound, and video from multiple sources into a single destination source to create complex documents. Previously disparate types of information are beginning to merge into a new synthesis, evidenced by products such as CD-ROM-based interactive encyclopedias, in-car electronic guidance (map) systems, and voice-controlled telephone systems. All these capabilities are outgrowths of the desire to mix and match previously unrelated kinds of data.</P>
<p>As a result of the standardization of the Windows interface and API, users have become accustomed to being able to cut, copy, and paste not only within a given program but between Windows programs. Nowadays, thousands of applications can easily share data with one another through these commands that use the Windows Clipboard.</P>
<p>But we still have the problem of proprietary file and data formats&#151;the kind of thing that makes a WordPerfect file different from a Word for Windows file, or a Microsoft Excel file different from a Lotus 1-2-3 file. These proprietary formats often seem to be promoted by software developers as a means of pushing their programs by locking users into a particular file format. Unfortunately, the proprietary-file-formats marketing strategy has backfired, leaving users grumbling and feeling held hostage by a particular brand of program.</P>
<p>For example, just try printing, say, a JPEG graphics file from your favorite word processing or desktop publishing program. The situation becomes even thornier when multimedia files are thrown in. We are now seeing competing formats for live-motion video, audio recording, MIDI files, and the like.</P>
<p>Software developers have finally figured this out, and they have made working with &#147;foreign&#148; file formats much easier. With each new month, more applications have built-in file-format converters to enable applications to share files. For example, Word for Windows 6 and 7 can read and write a whole gaggle of text and graphics file formats. Ditto for PageMaker, Ventura Publisher, Microsoft Access, and many others. Standards such as Rich Text Format (RTF), Windows Metafiles, and others are now emerging to facilitate data transfers between programs. Embedded TrueType fonts and utility programs such as Adobe Acrobat even enable people to see and edit documents containing fonts that are not in their systems.</P>
<p>In this chapter, we look at data sharing on the Windows 2000 platform, paying particular attention to the techniques you can use to create complex documents, including the latest in Windows data sharing: OLE version 2.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Exchanging Data with Windows 2000</FONT></H3>
<p>Actually, much more interesting than simply being able to use one program&#146;s document in another program is the ability to mix and match a great variety of document types, such as text, sound, graphics, spreadsheets, databases, and so forth. This mixing and matching lets you construct complex documents previously requiring physical cutting and pasting and possibly the aid of an art department. Such operations are dependent on the operating system&#146;s capacity to exchange data between dissimilar applications: spreadsheets and word processors, for example.
</P>
<p>Windows 2000 offers three internal vehicles for exchanging data between programs: the Windows Clipboard (and ClipBook, which is an extension of Clipboard), Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), and Object Linking and Embedding (OLE). In this chapter, we explain each of them, discuss how Windows 2000&#146;s treatment of them differs from other versions of Windows, and then describe some special considerations for data sharing across the network.</P>
<p>If you&#146;re new to Windows applications, you may want to read only the portion about the Clipboard and the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands. You&#146;ll use these commands much more often than the other techniques covered here. If you&#146;re using a network and want to share little bits of information with other people, then read about the ClipBook, too. If you want to take full advantage of what OLE has to offer under Windows, read the entire chapter. Using OLE, you can construct complex documents by putting, say, a portion of a spreadsheet or a fancy chart into a word processing document.</P>

<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Many of the examples in this chapter refer to Microsoft products. This isn&#146;t necessarily an endorsement of Microsoft products over other competing products! We&#146;re just using the most common examples to reach the widest audience, and the most commonly used products just happen to be Microsoft products.<hr></FONT>

<h3><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">Using the Clipboard</FONT></H3>
<p>Although the Clipboard is not capable of converting data files between various formats (such as <tt>.xls</TT> to <tt>.wk3</TT> or <tt>.rtf</TT> to <tt>.doc</TT>), it is great for many everyday data-exchange tasks. Just about all Windows programs support the use of the ubiquitous Cut, Copy, and Paste commands, and it&#146;s the Clipboard that provides this functionality for you.</P>
<p>The Clipboard makes it possible to move any kind of material&#151;whether it&#146;s text, data cells, graphics, video, or audio clips&#151;and OLE objects between documents and, with Windows 2000, between folders, the Desktop, Explorer, and other portions of the interface. The form of the source data doesn&#146;t matter that much, because the Clipboard and Windows together take care of figuring out what&#146;s being copied and where it&#146;s being pasted, making adjustments when necessary or providing just a few manual options for you to adjust. The Clipboard can also work with non-Windows (DOS) programs, albeit with certain limitations that we explain later.</P><p><br></P>
