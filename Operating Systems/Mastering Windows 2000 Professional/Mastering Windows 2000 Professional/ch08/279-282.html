<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading27"></A><font color="#000077">Editing an Embedded Object</FONT></H4>
<p>Now assume that you&#146;ve got an object embedded in a document&#151;anyone viewing the document can see it, or you can print it out, and so forth. If it&#146;s a video clip or sound clip, double-clicking it brings up a suitable program (such as Sound Recorder or Media Player) that runs the clip and enables the reader of the document to pause, stop, rewind, and replay the clip as needed. For other types of objects, double-clicking makes the object easy to edit.
</P>
<p>For example, say you have a graph in your Word document. To edit it, double-click the embedded item. The resulting scenario depends on whether the applications involved are OLE 1 or OLE 2. If both applications are OLE 2&#150;aware, what ideally happens is that the toolbar, menus, and commands in the application you&#146;re working with (the container application) change to those of the objects. Use them just as if you were working in whatever program created the object. If one or both of the applications are only OLE 1&#150;aware, the object&#146;s source application runs in its own window, and the object is loaded into it. Edit as you normally would.</P>
<p>In some cases, such as with a sound or video clip, double-clicking an object will &#147;play&#148; the object rather than enable you to edit it. You&#146;ll need to edit it via another means, such as right-clicking it and choosing Edit, or by selecting it, opening the File menu, and choosing Edit Object or some similar command.</P>
<p>In other cases, double-clicking an embedded file won&#146;t have any effect until you change modes. For example, with the Windows 3.<i>x</I> version of Cardfile you need to choose Edit <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-19i.jpg"> Picture first.</P>
<p>After you&#146;ve finished editing the embedded object, choose File <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-20i.jpg"> Update and then File <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-21i.jpg"> Exit, or just File <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-22i.jpg"> Exit and then answer Yes to any dialog boxes about updating.</P>

<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>As an alternative to the techniques described above, check to see if the compound document has an Edit menu option for editing the object. Select the object first, then check the Edit menu.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h3><a name="Heading28"></A><font color="#000077">Linking Objects</FONT></H3>
<p>Recall that linking an object is similar to embedding it, but there&#146;s one important difference! When linking, the object and the container both &#147;live&#148; in separate files on a hard disk somewhere. However, a connection exists between the linked document and the container it&#146;s linked to. This connection is called, not surprisingly, the <i>link.</I> So, instead of copying the object&#146;s data to the destination document, the link tells the destination application where to find the original source file.</P>
<p>As long as the link isn&#146;t broken, the link is kept alive by Windows 2000, even between sessions. You can edit the linked object by double-clicking it in the container document, just as you can an embedded object. However, the object opens in a separate window for editing&#151;even if both the server and client applications are OLE 2&#150;aware.</P>
<p>You can also edit the object separately using the program that created it, even if the container document isn&#146;t open. For example, if the linked item is a spreadsheet file, editing the spreadsheet file at its source (say by running 1-2-3, opening the file, editing the spreadsheet, and saving it) will still work. What&#146;s more, any changes you make to the file independently show up in any and all linked files. Because of this, linking is the technique to use when you want to use data that must always be identical in two or more documents.</P>
<p>To link two files, follow these steps:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Create or find the server document you want to link (the source document). For example, you could open Paint and draw something.
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Before a file can be linked, it has to be given a name and saved on disk. Windows won&#146;t let you link a file that&#146;s still called Untitled (the default name of many documents before they are saved).<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the portion of the document you want to pull into the container document.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose Edit <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-23i.jpg"> Copy to put it onto the Clipboard.<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Switch to the destination document.
<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Move the insertion point to the place where you want to insert the linked item.
<dd><b>6.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the container&#146;s Edit menu and choose Edit <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-24i.jpg"> Paste Link (not Paste). If there isn&#146;t a Paste Link command, look for Paste Special and the relevant linking option. You&#146;ll likely see a dialog box something like one of these two (from Word and Excel, respectively):<p><a name="Fig22"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-22.jpg',680,731)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-22t.jpg"></A></P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Some friendlier Paste Special dialog boxes explain what effect the various format options have when you paste the link. The default choice (the one that comes up highlighted when the box first appears) is usually your best bet. However, you might prefer one of the other choices, particularly if you want the linked material to have the exact same look as the source. When linking to a spreadsheet, for example, if you want the headings, grid, and exact font in which the spreadsheet is displayed, you would choose Bitmapped Picture. But be aware that linking data as a picture rather than text takes up much more room on the disk, making your file much larger. Importing data as formatted text is more space efficient.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<dd><b>7.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to establish a second link, repeat steps 4 through 6 but select a different destination document in step 4.
</DL>
<p>The linked item should now be added to the container document in the correct position. If everything went as planned, the object appears in its original form; that is, a graphic looks like a graphic, cells look like cells, and so forth. In some cases, when OLE applications aren&#146;t communicating properly, you&#146;ll see the source application&#146;s icon instead. This can occur with older applications such as Windows 3.<i>x</I>&#146;s Write and Word for Windows 2. If this happens, you&#146;re better off pasting in the text as plain text. Otherwise, what you get is essentially a packaged object.</P><p><br></P>
