<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading25"></A><font color="#000077">OLE Inconsistencies</FONT></H4>
<p>Developers, keen on building OLE compatibility into their products are complying more and more with OLE conventions. However, there&#146;s been some leeway in the interpretation of how an application will incorporate OLE, and idiosyncrasies and slight variations arise in the way you work with OLE in different applications. Drag-and-drop isn&#146;t implemented everywhere, so it&#146;s not as simple as Microsoft might have you believe. You may need to do a little snooping in an application&#146;s manual, use online Help, or check out an application&#146;s menus to determine how to import or edit OLE items in your application.
</P>
<p>For example, in the Windows 3.<i>x</I> Cardfile, you don&#146;t need to click a linked picture before you edit it, because Cardfile knows the picture is in the upper-left corner. Similarly, because you place a linked or embedded sound object in a destination document by double-clicking the Sound Recorder icon, you can&#146;t use the double-click method to edit the object as you would in the case of, say an embedded section of an Excel spreadsheet. Instead, you must use the Edit menu&#146;s Sound Object command.</P>
<p>As a general rule, one consistency you can usually count on is that an OLE-aware application has a Paste Special command on its Edit menu. If it&#146;s there, the application knows about OLE, and you&#146;ll almost certainly be able to use this command to embed and link objects into your documents.</P>
<p>Some applications (such as Word and WordPad) also have an Insert dialog box that lets you create and embed all kinds of objects, as shown in Figure 8.15. As you can see, this latter approach breaks down the distinction between running different applications to create different types of objects; you can create spreadsheets, images, and even animations all from within your word processing application!</P>

<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-19.jpg',928,695)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 8.15</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;WordPad has an Insert dialog box for creating and embedding objects of different types (even non-word-processing objects) on the fly while still in WordPad.</P>
<p>You may have found the previous discussion a bit daunting, what with all the hairy terms and such. Don&#146;t panic! OLE is a little confusing to everyone, especially because it&#146;s a scheme that&#146;s in flux. After you experiment with embedding and linking a bit, you&#146;ll figure it out.
</P>
<p>Now let&#146;s discuss the procedures for embedding, linking, and packaging objects in Windows 2000. We&#146;ll also discuss some networking and security issues that pertain to linked objects.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading26"></A><font color="#000077">Embedding Objects</FONT></H3>
<p>The difference between linking and embedding throws people sometimes, so let&#146;s talk about that for a minute. It might help to think of embedding an object as almost identical to pasting a static copy of it from the Clipboard in a regular old non-OLE document. This is because neither embedding nor pasting involves a link to external files. After a chart is embedded into your word processing file, it becomes part of that file. The only difference between standard Clipboard cut-and-paste and OLE embedding is that once embedded, an object can easily be edited by double-clicking it or via some other command. Even though the object (let&#146;s say a graph) isn&#146;t something the container application (let&#146;s say Word) knows how to edit, the object contains a pointer to a program that can edit it.
</P>
<p>You might want to experiment using some OLE applications, such as Word, Excel, Word Pro, 1-2-3, WordPad, or Sound Recorder, just to name a few. Here are the basic steps:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the source application and document. (The application must be able to perform as an OLE server.)
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the portion of the document you want to embed in another.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Switch to the destination application and document. Position the insertion point and choose Paste Special. When you do so, you may see a dialog box giving you some choices about what you want to do. For example, here are two Paste Special boxes, one from Word and one from Excel, respectively.
</DL>
<p><a name="Fig20"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-20.jpg',679,712)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-20t.jpg"></A></P>
<p>You might need to do a little head scratching to figure out which option to choose. As a rule, if the option says just plain Paste, that won&#146;t get you anything more than a normal paste job, which isn&#146;t what you want in this situation. You want a choice that does not say Link but does say something about an <i>object</I>. So, for example, in Word&#146;s dialog box, you would choose the first option and click OK. In the Excel box, you would choose Object and click Paste (not Paste Link, because that links the object rather than embeds it). Some dialog boxes let you choose to display the pasted information as an icon rather than as the item itself. For example, an embedded video clip typically appears in a box that displays the first video frame of the clip.</P>
<p>After doing the Paste operation, and assuming both applications are OLE-aware, you might get what looks like a static copy of the material (such as a bitmap); but the destination application knows the source application for the object, and thus the object can be edited easily. Figure 8.16 shows an example of a Microsoft Graph file embedded in a Word document.</P>
<p><a name="Fig21"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-21.jpg',928,696)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-21t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-21.jpg',928,696)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 8.16</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;After pasting a graph object into Word, the graph appears in the container document.</P>
<p>With some OLE applications you can embed an object using a command choice, such as Insert <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch08/images/08-18i.jpg"> Object. This leads to a dialog box that enables you to choose the type of object (all the OLE-aware programs on your system are listed). When you choose, the source application runs, and you can then create the object and exit. When you exit, the object is placed in the container document where were previously working.</P><p><br></P>
