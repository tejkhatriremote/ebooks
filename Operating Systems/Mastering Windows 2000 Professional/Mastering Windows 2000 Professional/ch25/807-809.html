<h3><a name="Heading8"></A><font color="#000077">Understanding How Windows 2000 and NetWare Interact</FONT></H3>
<p>A Novell NetWare network may incorporate Windows 2000 machines solely as workstations. This task is fairly simple because it requires no work on the server side at all. All you need to do to access the Novell servers directly from Windows 2000 is use the Client Service for NetWare, which is provided with Windows 2000 Professional.
</P>
<p>Here are a few things you should know about this solution:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It may require dual network client software, which can be hard to manage and require additional memory.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It <i>does</I> provide access to both Novell NetWare and Windows 2000 server resources, but security and programming interfaces are not integrated.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to share remote access and backup processes under this system.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It involves no special software installation on the servers, and so may be attractive to some network administrators.
</DL>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading9"></A><font color="#000077">Running NetWare and Windows 2000 Together</FONT></H4>
<p>The idea here is simple: Your office contains both Windows 2000 servers and a NetWare server or servers. The Windows 2000 servers talk NetBIOS/NetBEUI and perhaps TCP/IP, and the Novell servers talk IPX/SPX or TCP/IP. Getting the two server families (NetWare and Windows 2000) to talk to one another is a mite tricky, goes the reasoning, <i>so don&#146;t bother</I>. Instead, load both IPX/SPX and NetBIOS/NetBEUI stacks on your workstations.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>There is a very common belief in the networking world that the Microsoft operating systems use only NetBEUI, and NetWare uses only IPX/SPX. Today you will typically find that both are coexisting quite well using TCP/IP to communicate. You need to ensure that you have at least one protocol in common among all the computers that will communicate on your network.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Although both operating systems can use TCP/IP to communicate over the network, the Microsoft Client Services for NetWare will work <i>only</I> with NWLink installed. Here again, Microsoft is fostering the belief that NetWare only uses IPX/SPX for network communication.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><font size="+1"><b>The Older Solution: Windows for Workgroups and Windows 95</B></FONT></P>
<p>To better understand how Windows 2000 Professional is providing NetWare support, let&#146;s take a brief look at how Microsoft handled this problem in the past.
</P>
<p>Windows for Workgroups ships with an IPX/SPX stack that runs in combination with NetBIOS/NetBEUI, making it possible to carry on conversations with both Windows 2000 and NetWare servers. Here are some features of the NetWare and Windows 2000 server parallel solution:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>Simplicity</B> (kind of)&nbsp;&nbsp;You needn&#146;t install any software on the servers. You needn&#146;t put NWLink on your Windows 2000 machines nor install some kind of odd NetWare Loadable Module (NLM) on your NetWare servers.
<dd><b>Lack of drivers 1</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, Windows for Workgroups does not ship with a NetWare redirector. The IPX/SPX protocol is in place, but the redirector is not, requiring that you run the redirector that came with Windows for Workgroups version 3.1. Microsoft doesn&#146;t warn of this deficiency until you&#146;re part way through the installation of Windows for Workgroups version 3.11. (Nice touch, boys and girls!) In addition, the combination of 3.11 and the old 3.1 driver is a bit wobbly.
<dd><b>Lack of drivers 2</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you&#146;re running NetWare 4.<i>x</I> or 5.<i>x</I> servers, then there&#146;s just no way that you can make the old Windows for Workgroups 3.1 NetWare drivers work reliably. You have to download a bunch of drivers from one of Novell&#146;s online resources or from one of their support CDs. They seem to work fairly well talking to the NetWare servers but tend to eliminate some of the benefits of Workgroups. Besides, they cut off your connections to Windows 2000 Server machines periodically.
<dd><b>Memory management</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Insufficient memory becomes a problem in that you&#146;re loading a <i>lot</I> of programs on the workstation.
<dd><b>Sharing</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you&#146;re still running two different server environments, they don&#146;t share anything. You&#146;ve got to create separate user accounts on the Windows 2000 side of the house from the NetWare side. Remote access services aren&#146;t shared, requiring twice as many modems. Backup services aren&#146;t shared, so you&#146;ve got to keep track of twice as many tapes.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Windows 2000 greatly simplifies matters because Microsoft has written complete protocol stacks and client software for both Windows 2000 and Novell networks. Use all Microsoft client software, and you&#146;ll be dealing with only one vendor.<hr></FONT>
