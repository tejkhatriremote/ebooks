<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading22"></A><font color="#000077">Printing from a Program</FONT></H4>
<p>Unless you choose otherwise, the output from Windows and DOS programs are shunted to the Print Manager for printing. If no particular printer has been chosen (perhaps because the program&#151;for example, a DOS program or Notepad&#151;doesn&#146;t give you a choice), the default printer is used. You can set the default printer at any time by right-clicking a printer icon and choosing Set as Default.
</P>
<p>The appearance of your printed documents varies somewhat from program to program because not all programs can take full advantage of the capabilities of your printer and printer driver. For example, simple word processing programs such as Notepad don&#146;t let you change the font; a full-blown word processing program such as Word Pro can print all kinds of fancy graphics, fonts, columns of text, and so forth.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Here&#146;s something to consider if you are still using DOS programs: If you choose as your default a printer that your DOS programs can&#146;t work with, your print jobs could bomb. Suppose you&#146;re running WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS and have it installed to print to an HP LaserJet, but the default printer is a PostScript printer. Your printouts would be nothing but a list of PostScript commands, such as <tt>ERROR: undefined, OFFENDING COMMAND: |ume STACK &#123;&#151;pop&#151;</TT>, and so on. On another type of printer, you might see garbage printouts, such as <tt>&#64;#&#36;&#64;&#36;%G&#36;V%B^YB&#38;M(OM</TT> instead of readable text. Just make sure your DOS programs can work with your default printer. Also, depending on how the DOS program accesses the printer, it might not work at all under Windows 2000.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>When you print from any program, the file is printed to a disk file instead of directly to the printer. Print Manager then spools the file to the assigned printer(s), coordinating the flow of data and keeping you informed of the progress. Jobs are queued up and listed in the Print Manager window, from which their status can be observed; they can be rearranged, deleted, and so forth.
</P>
<p>To print from any program, including Windows (both 16-bit and 32-bit) programs, follow these steps:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Check to see that the printer and page settings are correct. Some program&#146;s File menus provide a Printer Setup, Page Setup, or other option for this. Note that settings you make from such a box temporarily (sometimes permanently, depending on the program) override settings made from the Printer Properties dialog box.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the Print command on the program&#146;s File menu and fill in whatever information is asked of you. For example, in WordPad, the Print dialog box looks like Figure 6.19. Some programs have rather elaborate dialog boxes for choosing which printer you want to print to, scaling or graphically altering the printout, and even adjusting the properties of the printer. Still, you can usually make only the most obvious settings, such as the following, and get away with it:
<dl>
<br>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Correct printer
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Correct number of copies
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Correct print range (pages, spreadsheet cells, portion of graphic, and so on)
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;For color printers, which ink cartridge you have in (black-and-white or color)
</DL>

<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-29.jpg',562,200)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 6.19</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you choose Print from a Windows program, you often see a dialog box such as this that enables you to choose some options before printing. This dialog is from WordPad, a program supplied with Windows 2000.</P>
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click OK (or otherwise confirm printing). Windows 2000 intercepts the print data and writes it in a file, then begins printing it. If an error occurs (a port conflict, the printer is out of paper, or another problem), you&#146;ll see a message such as the following.
<p><a name="Fig30"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-30.jpg',441,126)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-30t.jpg"></A></P>
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you see this message, check the paper supply, check that the printer is turned on, and check that it&#146;s online (there may be a switch on the printer for this). If it&#146;s a network printer, make sure it&#146;s shared and that the computer it&#146;s connected to is booted up and has shared the printer for use.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>When printing commences, a little printer icon appears in the Taskbar next to the clock. You can double-click this icon to see details of your pending print jobs.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading23"></A><font color="#000077">Printing by Dragging Files</FONT></H4>
<p>You can quickly print Windows program document files by dragging them onto a printer&#146;s icon or window. You can drag from the Desktop, a folder, the Find box, Explorer, or the File Manager window into the running Print Manager. This works only with documents that have an association with a particular program. (See Chapter 3, &#147;Organizing Programs and Documents,&#148; for a discussion of associating.) To check if a document has an association, right-click it. If the menu that pops up has an Open command on it (not Open With), it has an association.
</P>
<p>To use this technique, first arrange your screen so you can see the file(s) you want to print as well as either the printer&#146;s icon or its window. (You open a printer&#146;s window by double-clicking its icon.) Then drag the document file(s) into the Print Manager icon or window. The file is loaded into the source program, the Print command is automatically executed, and the file is spooled to Print Manager. The document isn&#146;t moved out of its home folder; it&#146;s just printed.</P>
<p>A benefit of using this approach is that you can drag multiple files onto a printer&#146;s icon or open window at once. All the documents will be queued up for printing, one after another, via their source programs. You&#146;ll see the following message asking for confirmation before printing commences:</P>
<p><a name="Fig31"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-31.jpg',452,119)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-31t.jpg"></A></P>
<p>One caveat about this technique: As you know, some programs don&#146;t have a built-in facility for printing to a printer other than the default one. Try to drag a document that requires the default printer to a different printer, and you may see this message:
</P>
<p><a name="Fig32"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-32.jpg',611,119)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-32t.jpg"></A></P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The drag-and-drop method can be used with shortcuts, too. You can drag shortcuts of documents to a printer or even to a shortcut of a printer, and the process will still work. If you like this way of printing, keep a shortcut of your printer on the Desktop so you can drag documents to it without needing to open the Printers folder. Double-clicking a shortcut provides an easy means of checking its print queue, too.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading24"></A><font color="#000077">Printing by Right-Clicking a Document</FONT></H4>
<p>Another printing shortcut you can use with some documents doesn&#146;t even require you to have a printer icon in view. Right-click the icon of any document you want to print. If the right-click menu has a Print command on it, you can select that command to print the document, as shown in the following graphic.
</P>
<p><a name="Fig33"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-33.jpg',121,212)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-33t.jpg"></A></P>
<p>The file opens in its source program and starts printing right away. Once spooled to the Print Manager, the document closes automatically. If the right-click menu does not list a Print command, press Esc to cancel the menu. You can&#146;t print the document using this technique.
