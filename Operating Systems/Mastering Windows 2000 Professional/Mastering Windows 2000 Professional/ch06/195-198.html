<h3><a name="Heading25"></A><font color="#000077">Working with the Print Queue</FONT></H3>
<p>If you print more than a few files at a time, or if you share your printer for network use, you&#146;ll sometimes want to check the status of a printer&#146;s print jobs. You also might want to see how many jobs need to print before you turn off your local computer and printer if others are using it. Or you might want to know how many other jobs are ahead of yours.
</P>
<p>You can check on these items by opening a printer&#146;s window. You&#146;ll see this information:</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Document Name</B>
<dd>Name of the file being printed and possibly the source program
<dt><b>Status</B>
<dd>Whether the job is printing, being deleted, or paused
<dt><b>Owner</B>
<dd>Who sent each print job to the printer
<dt><b>Progress</B>
<dd>How large each job is and how much of the current job has been printed
<dt><b>Start at</B>
<dd>When each print job was sent to the print queue
</DL>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If the print job originated from a DOS program, the document name will not be known. It&#146;s listed as Remote Downlevel Document, meaning that it came from a workstation that doesn&#146;t support Microsoft&#146;s RPC (Remote Procedure Call) print support. This is also true of print jobs from Windows for Workgroups, LAN Manager, Unix, and NetWare.<hr></FONT>

<p>Figure 6.20 shows a sample printer with a print queue and related information.

<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-34.jpg',485,443)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 6.20</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;A printer&#146;s window with several print jobs pending</P>
<p>To see the queue on a printer, open the Printers folder and double-click the printer in question. Adjust the window size if necessary so you can see all the columns. You can resize the columns in the display to see more data in a small window. Move the pointer to the dividing line in the header display and drag the line left or right.
</P>
<p>If the printer in question is a network printer, and the printer is offline for some reason, such as its computer isn&#146;t turned on, you&#146;ll be forced to work <i>offline</I>. An error message will alert you to this, and the top line of the printer&#146;s window will read, &#147;User intervention required&#151;Work Offline.&#148; Until the issue is resolved, you won&#146;t be able to view the queue for that printer. You can still print to it, however.</P>
<p>When an error occurs during a print job, Windows 2000 tries to determine the cause. For example, the printer might be out of paper, or the printer might be offline or unplugged from the AC outlet. You may be forced to work offline until the problem is resolved. Opening the printer&#146;s queue should display an error message approximating the nature of the problem to the best of Print Manager&#146;s capabilities. Check the printer&#146;s File menu to see if the Work Offline setting has been activated. When you think the problem has been solved, turn off this setting to begin printing again.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading26"></A><font color="#000077">Refreshing the Network Queue Information</FONT></H4>
<p>The network cabling that connects workstations and servers often is busy, so Windows 2000 usually doesn&#146;t bother to add more traffic to the network by polling each workstation for printer-queue information. This is done when necessary, such as when a document is deleted from a queue.
</P>
<p>If you want to refresh the window for a printer to get the absolute latest information, press F5. This immediately updates the queue information.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading27"></A><font color="#000077">Deleting a File from the Queue</FONT></H4>
<p>After sending a file to the queue, you might change your mind about printing it. For example, you might discover that you need to make some changes before printing the document. If so, you can simply remove the file from the queue. Here&#146;s the procedure:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the printer&#146;s window.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the file by clicking it in the queue.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose Document <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-05i.jpg"> Cancel Printing, press Delete, or right-click and choose Cancel Printing. The document item is removed from the printer&#146;s window. If you&#146;re trying to delete the job that&#146;s printing, you might have some trouble. At the very least, the system might take some time to respond.</DL>
<p>You can delete other people&#146;s print jobs if the printer in question is connected to <i>your</I> computer. However, normally, you can&#146;t delete someone else&#146;s print jobs on a remote printer. If you try to, you are told that this is beyond your privileges and that you should contact your system administrator. If you want to be able to delete jobs on a remote computer, someone must alter the security settings on the remote computer to enable remote administration of the printer. Remote administration is covered in Part V.</P>
<p>You may find, especially with PostScript laser-type printers, that after deleting a file while printing, you need to reset the printer to clear its buffer or at least eject the current page (if you have a page-eject button). To reset, you typically need to push a button on the printer&#146;s front panel or turn off the printer for a few seconds, then on again.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Because print jobs in Windows 2000 are stored on the hard drive of the print server as files, pending print jobs are not lost when computers are powered down. Any documents in the queue when the system goes down reappear in the queue when you power up. When you turn on a computer that is the host for a shared printer that has an unfinished print queue, you are alerted to the number of jobs in the queue and asked whether to delete or print them.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading28"></A><font color="#000077">Canceling All Pending Print Jobs on a Printer</FONT></H4>
<p>Sometimes, because of a megalithic meltdown or some other catastrophe, you&#146;ll decide to bail out of all the print jobs that are stacked up for a printer. Normally, you don&#146;t need to do this, even if the printer has gone wacky. You can just pause the queue (as described in the next section) and continue printing after the problem is solved. But sometimes you&#146;ll want to resend everything to another printer and remove the queue on the current one. It&#146;s easy:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the printer&#146;s icon or window.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-click and choose Cancel All Documents, as shown in the following graphic. Or, from the printer&#146;s window choose Printer <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-06i.jpg"> Cancel All Documents. All queued jobs for the printer are canceled.<p><a name="Fig35"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-35.jpg',151,237)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-35t.jpg"></A></P>
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Make sure you really want to cancel the jobs before you choose Cancel All Documents. This is a good way to make enemies if people on the network were counting on their print jobs being finished anytime soon.<hr></FONT>
