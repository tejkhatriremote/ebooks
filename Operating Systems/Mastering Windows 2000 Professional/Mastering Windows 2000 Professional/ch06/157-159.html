<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading5"></A><font color="#000077">About Adding Printers</FONT></H4>
<p>Before running the Add Printer Wizard, let&#146;s consider when you would need to add a new printer to your Windows 2000 configuration:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#146;re connecting a new printer directly to your computer.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone has connected a new printer elsewhere on the network, and you would like to use it from your computer.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to print to disk files that can later be sent to a particular type of printer.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to set up multiple printer configurations (preferences) for a single physical printer so you can easily switch between them without changing your printer setup between print jobs.
</DL>
<p>Notice that a great deal of flexibility exists here, especially in the case of the last item. Because of the modularity of Windows 2000&#146;s internal design, even though you might have only one physical printer, you can create any number of printer definitions for it, each with different characteristics (and different descriptive names).
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>These printer definitions are actually called <i>printers</I>, but you can think of them as printer names, printer aliases, or named virtual devices.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>For example, you might want to set up one definition to print on legal-sized paper in landscape orientation and another to print with standard-sized paper in portrait orientation. Each of these two &#147;printers&#148; would use the same physical printer to print. While you&#146;re working with Windows 2000&#146;s manual, Online Help, and this book, keep this terminology in mind. The word <i>printer</I> often doesn&#146;t refer to a physical printer. It usually means a printer setup that you&#146;ve created with the wizard. It&#146;s a collection of settings that typically points to a physical printer, but it could just as well create a print file instead of a paper printout.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading6"></A><font color="#000077">About Printer Drivers</FONT></H4>
<p>Also consider that a printer can&#146;t just connect to your computer and mysteriously print a fancy page of graphics or even a boring page of text. You need a printer <i>driver</I>. The printer driver (a file on your hard disk) translates your text file to commands that tell your printer how to print your file. Because different brands and models of printers use different commands for such actions as &#147;move up a line, print a circle in the middle of the page, print the letter <i>A</I>,&#148; and so on, a specialized printer driver is needed for each type of printer.</P>
<p>DOS programs running under Windows 2000 also require a print driver for applications. For instance, WordPerfect 5.1 running in a DOS session under Windows 2000 uses a DOS printer driver <i>and</I> a Windows 2000 printer driver to print.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Because some printers are functionally equivalent, a driver for a popular brand and model of printer (for example, an Epson or a Hewlett-Packard) often masquerades under different names for other printers.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>When you add a printer, you may be asked to choose the brand and model of printer. Windows 2000 has the benefit of Plug-and-Play technology, and can usually detect your printer correctly. If you own a printer that cannot be detected by Windows 2000, you will need to tell the system what kind of printer you have so the correct driver can be installed.
</P>
<p>A good printer driver takes advantage of all your printer&#146;s capabilities, such as its built-in fonts and graphics features. A poor printer driver might succeed in printing only draft-quality text, even from a sophisticated printer.</P>
<p>If you&#146;re the proud owner of some offbeat brand of printer, you may be alarmed when you can&#146;t find your printer listed in the box when you run the wizard. But don&#146;t worry, the printer&#146;s manufacturer might be able to supply a driver. The procedure for installing manufacturer-supplied drivers is covered later in this chapter, in the section titled &#147;Adding a Printer That Is Not on Windows 2000&#146;s List.&#148;</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading7"></A><font color="#000077">About the Add Printer Wizard</FONT></H4>
<p>Microsoft has made the previously arduous chore of adding a printer somewhat simpler, though it is still a multistep process. You may be adding a network print server or a local computer, which is one that is attached to your computer. We&#146;ll start with the procedure for adding a network printer.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Adding a Network Printer</B></FONT></P>
<p>Assuming your Windows 2000 network system is successfully cabled and running, network printing should be possible. Before a network user can access a network printer, the following must be true:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The printer must be cabled to the sharing computer. If the printer has a direct network interface, then the sharing computer must be on the same network as the printer.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The printer must be created; that is, you need to complete all the steps in the Add Printer Wizard to create the printer, and it must be working properly for local use.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The printer must be shared.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The security settings for the printer and network users wishing access must match.
</DL>
<p>By default, new printer shares are given a security setting that gives all users (<i>Everyone</I>) access for printing. Only the creator, power users, and administrators can <i>manage</I> the printer, however. Managing the printer means rearranging the print-job queue: starting, stopping, and deleting print jobs.</P>
<p>Connecting to a shared printer using Windows 2000 is so easy that it&#146;s tempting to believe that you didn&#146;t do it right until you print successfully. To connect to a printer on the network, all you do, in essence, is point to the printer you want to use and say: &#147;Print here.&#148; Of course, the print server administrator has control over who can use the printer you just pointed to, but apart from giving the print server administrator flowers and candy, you have no control over his printer settings. This makes connecting to a networked printer easy, and it also makes Windows 2000 flexible and controllable (for the printer administrators).</P>
<p>Because Windows 2000 workstations use the printer drivers stored on the print server, even if you install a newer version of a driver on the print server, the Windows 2000 workstations will use it automatically. You don&#146;t need to tweak the workstation connection.</P><p><br></P>
