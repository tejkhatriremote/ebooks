<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Start the Registry Editor (<tt>regedt32.exe</TT>) and go to the following subkey in the handle key <tt>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</TT> on <tt>Local Machine</TT> subtree:

Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Ports

<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Edit menu, choose Add Value.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Value Name box, type the printer port that you deleted (for example, COM1: or LPT1:). Keep the default value in the Data box (<tt>REG_SZ</TT>), and click OK.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the String box, type the appropriate settings that correspond to the port you typed in the Value Name box. For example, you would type <b>9600,n,8,1</B> for any COM ports. Table 6.1 tells you exactly what the values in each section should be for each port.

<p><font size="+1"><b>Configuring a Port</B></FONT></P>
<p>If the printer you are setting up is connected to a parallel port, you can specify the time lapse before the Print Manager decides that the printer is not responding and notifies you (as the user) of an error. Setting the Transmission Retry number higher or lower adjusts the amount of time that the Print Manager will wait for a printer to prepare itself to accept data.
</P>
<p>This setting affects not only the printer that you&#146;ve selected, but also any other local printers that use the same printer driver. Click the Configure Port button in the Ports tab to set the time-out value.</P>
<p>To adjust the time-out, just type in a number. As you can see in the following graphic, the time is measured in seconds.</P>
<p><a name="Fig18"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-18.jpg',296,101)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch06/images/06-18t.jpg"></A></P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading15"></A><font color="#000077">Scheduling Print Jobs</FONT></H4>
<p>Another way to control access is to schedule print jobs. In the Printer Properties dialog box, click the Advanced tab to see the dialog box shown in Figure 6.11.
</P>

<p><font size="+1"><b>Setting Availability Times</B></FONT></P>
<p>You can choose not to have the printer always available (the default) by clicking the Available From radio button next to Available and filling in the hours the printer can produce output. To adjust print times, click the up and down arrows of the From and To boxes, or type in the times that you want the printer to be available. If a print job is sent to a printer during its &#147;off&#148; hours, that job won&#146;t disappear, but it will sit in the queue until the printer is authorized to print again.
</P>
<p>Although you can set user logon hours and printer hours, you must set the same printer hours for all groups and users who have access to a particular printer. For example, you can&#146;t restrict a group of users to accessing a printer only between 9 <small>A.M.</SMALL> and 5 <small>P.M.</SMALL> if the administrators can access it at any time. There are exceptions to this rule, however: You can adjust users&#146; logon times so that they are forcibly disconnected when their logon hours expire. You can also set up two printer names: one name for the window of time when the printer is open for use and the other name with a different time window. Those who connect to the printer name with the limited hours will be able to use the printer only during those hours.</P>

<table border="2" bordercolor="#0000" align="CENTER">
<tr><td><font size="+1"><b>Using Scheduling</B></FONT>
<p>Let&#146;s look at some of the ways you can use scheduling. Imagine that two people (Jose and Fred) need different access rights to different printers. You, as the printer administrator, want Jose to be able to use the ink-jet printer all the time, but to use the laser printer only on Fridays when the graphics department goes home early. You want Fred, who is in the graphics department, to go home early instead of racking up overtime pay and therefore you don&#146;t want him to use the laser printer at all on Fridays. Fred still needs access to the ink-jet printer on Friday mornings and the rest of the week.
</P>
<p>Because both Jose and Fred can have access to the ink-jet printer all week, no special restrictions need to be made. The laser printer is another matter. Here, you need to set up two printers with different access times for the laser printer. You call one <i>Week Use Laser Printer,</I> share it with the network, restrict access times to Monday through Thursday, and connect Fred&#146;s workstation to that printer. You then set up another printer with the same specifications, except it&#146;s called <i>Friday Use Laser Printer,</I> restrict the hours of use to Fridays and connect Jose&#146;s workstation to that printer (which is physically the same printer as Fred&#146;s laser printer).</P>
</TABLE>

<p><font size="+1"><b>Setting Printer Priorities</B></FONT></P>
<p>If you want to share your printer with the network but don&#146;t want everyone else&#146;s print jobs crowding out your own, you can give the printer two names: one name for you to use that has a high priority and a name for everyone else to use that has a lower priority. To further hone print priorities for different user groups, you can give the printer three or more names, each with its own priority attached, and then assign each group access to a printer name according to their priority.
</P>
<p>Priorities decide where the document goes in line for the printer; it won&#146;t interrupt a document that is already printing. This means that when a high priority document enters the queue, it jumps over the lower priority jobs that are waiting in line. As soon as the print device is available, the high priority job will be printed. When you&#146;re setting the printer priorities, don&#146;t forget that higher numbers (up to 99) have priority over lower ones. The default value is 1.</P>
<p>If you like, you can send print jobs directly to the port connected to the printer. If you do this, however, you won&#146;t be able to use your application until the print job is done.</P><p><br></P>
