<h2><a name="Heading1"></A><font color="#000077">Introduction</FONT></H2>
<p><big><big>W</BIG></BIG>hat you have in your hands is a soup-to-nuts, beginner-to-expert, end-user-to-administrator handbook&#151;the all-in-one guide to using and supporting Windows 2000 Professional, Microsoft&#146;s successor to Windows NT 4 Workstation.</P>
<p>The first section of this book focuses on all the essential topics for users and includes an overview of the new interface, essential tasks, customization, and tools. Delve deeper in this book, and you&#146;ll learn how to tap Windows 2000&#146;s enormous power as a network OS.</P>
<p>If you don&#146;t know DOS from Windows, read the first few chapters. If you can&#146;t figure out how Security Access Tokens and Security Descriptors work, look in the later chapters.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>What We Cover in This Book</B></FONT></P>
<p>As mentioned above, we&#146;ve tried to provide everything you need in this book to use Windows 2000 Professional effectively, whether you&#146;re an end user or a support person. The book is divided into six parts, building in a logical order from familiarizing yourself with Windows 2000 to troubleshooting an entire networked Windows 2000 system.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b><i>Part I: The Basics</I></B></FONT></P>
<p>Part I consists of five chapters. The first is an overview of Windows 2000 Professional&#151;what&#146;s new since the last incarnation (plenty!), what makes it different from other operating systems and other versions of Windows (including what makes it different from Windows 9x), and what its main features are. Don&#146;t be misled if it seems there&#146;s a lot of jargon in this first chapter: We figured that power users who are already familiar with other operating systems will be looking to this chapter just to get an idea of what&#146;s different in Windows 2000; if you&#146;re not a power user on another system, you won&#146;t miss anything if you simply skim these comparisons.
</P>
<p>Chapter 2 continues in the same vein, but is more specific and more user-oriented, with information about programs you no longer need under this advanced type of operating system, and advice on how to go about running the programs you <i>will</I> be using. In other words, this is the chapter that gives you your first real introduction to <i>using</I> Windows 2000 Professional.</P>
<p>Chapter 3, nominally about organizing your programs and files in a useful and accessible hierarchy on your hard drive, takes the opportunity to introduce the tools you&#146;ll be using to accomplish those goals: the Start menu (which you can organize as <i>you</I> see fit, to afford instant access to anything and everything on your system) and Explorer (the replacement to Windows File Manager and Program Manager, combined into one).</P>
<p>Next, Chapter 4 unveils one of the key features of Windows 2000, right-click menus, in very few pages. These context-sensitive menus, which pop up when you click your right mouse button on various objects found throughout the interface, offer a streamlined approach to computing: they offer, in a single place, only the commands that are most likely to be relevant to the operation you&#146;re currently performing! Right-click menus also offer a highly convenient route to your <i>properties sheets</I>, which offer configuration options and settings specific to the object at hand, whether it be a file, a folder, a printer, a modem, or even another user&#146;s access profile!</P>
<p>Rounding out this first part of the book, Chapter 5 will help you customize the look of your Desktop, including the way your programs&#146; windows behave on screen, what fonts and colors your programs use, and settings for screen savers. We also discuss making changes to your default mouse properties, like adjusting the double-click speed and using special mouse pointers for fun or for added visibility.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b><i>Part II: Getting to Work</I></B></FONT></P>
<p>Part II contains six chapters, each addressing a distinctive Windows 2000 feature or facility that you&#146;ll use frequently in your work. Chapter 6, &#147;Printers and Printing,&#148; is a must for virtually all users because everyone wants to print things, and printers are, for one reason or another, still a pain to set up and keep in working order. Add to that the number of options Windows 2000 offers for controlling print jobs&#151;like prioritizing different users on a network, changing the default fonts and graphics, adding and subtracting different types of printers, and so on&#151;and the topic can quickly become bewildering unless you have a manual. This chapter functions as this manual.
</P>
<p>If you have any intention of using audio or video with your system, you&#146;ll be happy to know that you can turn to Chapter 7 for an all-in-one guide to using multimedia on your Windows 2000 Professional workstation. Covering Windows 2000&#146;s audio and video capabilities in depth, we discuss not only installing the different sorts of hardware and software you&#146;ll be using, but we&#146;ll also discuss general instructions on <i>how</I> to use them. Discussions of the various standards in the field of audio and video recording/playback will help you ensure that your projects work for every member of your team, if not for widespread distribution as well.</P>
<p>No matter what kind of work you plan to do with your system, make plans now to set aside time for Chapter 8, because it covers the fundamental topic of putting your data where it will do the most good. In this chapter, we teach you how to move and share information of all types between different projects&#151;like inserting a spreadsheet or even an audio clip into a word processing report, adding a video sequence to a slide show, and moving a paragraph from the middle of a document to the beginning of the same document. If you&#146;re already familiar with simple cut, copy, and paste techniques, you&#146;ll be surprised at how much more you can do once you take advantage of the OLE methods available through new Windows 2000 applications.</P>
<p>Chapters 9, 10, and 11 cover some of the programs supplied for free with Windows 2000 Professional, programs that can stand on their own as basic replacements for more expensive word processing and image painting programs. (In case you&#146;re wondering, the <i>utility</I> programs that come with Windows 2000, for inspecting and configuring the operating system itself, are discussed later in the book.) We also introduce the Windows Imaging accessory, which offers an easy facility for viewing and organizing libraries of documents and images on your hard disk and makes it easy to share those images (along with your annotations) with other users. Although as a class these accessory programs might not be the most sophisticated programs in their respective categories, they are well thought out&#151;and the fact that they&#146;re built into the operating system makes them really fast and really handy. If you&#146;re like me, you&#146;ll probably end up using them more than you expect.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b><i>Part III: Connecting to the World</I></B></FONT></P>
<p>The chapters in Part III take the step-by-step, one-option-at-a-time approach that is really required if you want to take full advantage of the features Windows 2000 offers in the area of communications. In these chapters, we explore e-mail, working on the Internet, and using your modem to make regular connections to other computers and to online services. Windows 2000 Professional has a bundle of communications programs built right into it, notably Outlook Express, the new Fax Service, and HyperTerminal. This section walks you through using them to your best advantage.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b><i>Part IV: Becoming a Windows 2000 Expert</I></B></FONT></P>
<p>After you&#146;re past the &#147;getting comfortable&#148; stages of Parts I through III, you might feel like taking on the mantle of expert user&#151;the user who is there to help other users get their work done most efficiently. That&#146;s the goal of the second half of the book (Parts IV through VI).
</P>
<p>Chapter 17 introduces this more advanced half of the book, with a techie look at the good and bad parts of Windows 2000. Chapter 18 examines Windows 2000&#146;s architecture&#151;the pieces and parts of the operating system&#151;which will, at the very least, equip you with an understanding of error messages. Chapter 18 will also give you a grasp on the importance of Microsoft&#146;s architecture shift under Windows 2000, whereby the user interface was moved to &#147;privileged&#148; mode.</P>
<p>One of the ways that Windows 2000 is radically different from every other operating system is that it is <i>secure</I>; in fact, Windows 2000 has been certified by the United States government as meeting the requirements for C2 level security. Security is a great thing to have, for obvious reasons, but it can also cause problems&#151;the first time you can&#146;t access a file on your own computer, you&#146;ll want to know why! Chapter 19 takes you through the details of Windows 2000 security so that you can address problems quickly and directly.</P>
<p>In Chapter 20, we take up the topic of <i>installing</I> Windows 2000 Professional, on your own, as well as for other users. Like all advanced operating systems, Windows 2000 has a somewhat complex, time-consuming installation process. <i>Unlike</I> Windows 3.x, you can&#146;t just install the operating system on one computer and then copy it to other, similar computers; you have to start Setup on every workstation that will be running Windows 2000. However, we&#146;ll show you how you can reduce the amount of work needed to install the system&#151;by means of an automatic, &#147;unattended&#148; installation.</P>
<p>After you have your system set up, you&#146;ll need to know about the <i>Registry</I>, which we cover in Chapter 21. Anyone who&#146;s supported Windows 3.x knows about <tt>.ini</TT> files, the ASCII files that contain the settings that control Windows and Windows apps. All in all, <tt>.ini</TT> files aren&#146;t a bad idea, but a natural development of the <tt>.ini</TT> approach was a profusion of such files, sometimes dozens on a single computer, which makes things tough for whoever&#146;s called on to maintain and support the system. That&#146;s why Microsoft decided to forgo <tt>.ini</TT> files in Windows 2000 (and also in Windows 9x) and instead create a single database of system and application settings. That database is called the Registry, and every support person needs to know how to work with it. In Chapter 21, you learn what the Registry is, how it&#146;s organized, how and when to modify it, where it physically resides on the system, and, most importantly, how to back it up before you start fiddling with it.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b><i>Part V: Networking</I></B></FONT></P>
<p>Next, we move into the first of several chapters on networking with Windows 2000. Chapters 22 and 23 work together as a pair, providing in tandem an overview of everything that is involved in networking workstation computers. Chapter 22 is an introduction to overall networking concerns, delving just a bit into many fundamental topics. Chapter 23 elaborates the down-and-dirty of those same topics, it describes everything from logical topologies to physical cabling and connectors. If you&#146;re fuzzy on the difference between an Internet router and Roto-Rooter, it will pay for you to take a hard look at these chapters.
</P>
<p>Chapter 24 steps you through the Windows 2000 features that are designed to enable users to share information with other users. In particular, you&#146;ll learn how to assign rights in order to protect files and devices from unpermitted access. You&#146;ll also discover the appropriate settings for new cards and adapters that your existing network might require to communicate with your Windows 2000 system.</P>
<p>Chapter 25 deals with the very likely scenario of you planning to use your Windows 2000 Professional workstations over a Novell NetWare network. Over half of the file servers in the world now run some version of Novell&#146;s popular NetWare operating system, and Microsoft, recognizing the reality of this situation, has worked with Novell to provide NT users with tools to make it easy to operate over such systems. In this chapter, you&#146;ll learn the idiosyncrasies of those tools, known collectively as <i>Client Service for Novell NetWare</I>.</P>
<p>And don&#146;t skip Chapter 26! Even if you&#146;re not planning to access your office computer from a hotel room while attending a convention, after you see what you can do with a remote connection, you may start dreaming of the things you can accomplish over your network without even going to the office! And, of course, if you&#146;re a support person, you already recognize that we&#146;re becoming more and more a mobile workforce. Windows 2000 Professional includes remote access capability right out of the box, with the Dial-Up Networking (DUN) facility. Put simply, DUN turns your modem into a long-distance network card&#151;and Chapter 26 shows you how to use it.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b><i>Part VI: Administering and Troubleshooting</I></B></FONT></P>
<p>Windows 9x fans will find that most of what they like about Windows 9x is also present in Windows 2000. For instance, try to install a new driver, say for a mouse or for many other necessary and/or popular devices, and you&#146;ll quickly see that one of the most significant changes from NT 4 is the inclusion of Plug and Play. Chapter 27 simply and clearly explains what types of hardware Windows 2000 does support, and how to find, install, configure, and update drivers for that hardware. You won&#146;t realize how valuable this chapter is until the first time you&#146;ve spent 20 minutes on a &#147;driver treasure hunt&#148; trying to figure out how to install a new sound board driver!
</P>
<p>Windows 2000 has enjoyed fairly good application support already, and a number of 32-bit applications are available today. But some of us rely on old DOS and Windows programs that may <i>never</I> get upgraded to 32-bit. As Chapter 28 explains, Windows 2000 can run <i>many</I> DOS and Windows programs, but its secure nature actually makes it <i>un</I>able to run <i>some</I> old programs. Find out what it is that determines whether a program will or won&#146;t run under Windows 2000, and, if it <i>will</I> run, how to run it most quickly.</P>
<p>In Chapter 29, we&#146;ll let you in on a little secret: Although Windows 2000 Professional is probably one of the most stable, crash-proof operating systems that&#146;s ever been available for the PC, it <i>can</I> still crash. When it does, anyone claiming to be an expert should expect to be asked to explain it, and the first thing you&#146;ll be asked is, &#147;What&#146;s the deal with this blue screen?&#148; Blue screens needn&#146;t make you blue, but they will give you food for thought. In this chapter, we&#146;ll show you how to interpret such screens and explain what you can do with the information. Chapter 30 follows up on this topic, with a look at how to use administrative and diagnostic tools to keep your system up to speed.</P>
<p>In Chapter 31, we&#146;ve collected all the customization and optimization options that don&#146;t fit neatly into the other chapters. Here you&#146;ll find details about everything from how to change your keyboard so that you can write in Spanish to how to change Registry settings without having to actually wade through the Registry. If you&#146;re a systems administrator, computer jock, or power user, and you haven&#146;t found the options you need discussed elsewhere in the book, be sure to check out this chapter.</P>
<p>In Chapter 32, we look at some advanced troubleshooting techniques. This chapter focuses on the methodology of troubleshooting Windows 2000, including using the Microsoft Knowledge Base to find answers, applying Service Packs, and learning to troubleshoot using the architecture of Windows 2000.</P>
<p>In the Appendix, we talk about how to install Service Packs, and some good practices to follow. The Glossary contains useful definitions of many of the terms used in this book.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Typesetting Conventions Followed in This Book</B></FONT></P>
<p>As much as we could, we attempted to be consistent throughout the book with the capitalization of menu commands and dialog-box options. And all program-level filenames and command names appear in a <tt>special font</TT> to help distinguish them from the natural grammar of the sentence.</P>
<p>In regard to <i>italics</I>, we&#146;ve italicized terms for emphasis or as needed to avoid confusion. For example, key terms being defined for the first time are in italics. Furthermore, when we&#146;re presenting the syntax of a command (yes, system administrators will still occasionally be dealing with command-line entry), placeholders and variables will be represented in italics.</P>
<p>Finally, anything we instruct you to type into an entry field or command line will be shown in <b>boldface</B> type.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Stay in Touch!</B></FONT></P>
<p>I hope you find the answers to all of your Windows 2000 Professional questions here. But if you have questions we didn&#146;t cover, or if you have a comment on the book, or if we made a mistake, then I&#146;d love to hear from you. Just e-mail <tt>help&#8224;minasi.com</TT> with questions, comments, or suggestions for future editions. I try to answer all of the e-mail that I get, but you can help me with that by doing a couple of things. First, please don&#146;t send me receipted mail: For various reasons that I won&#146;t go into here, I&#146;ve set up my mail handler to automatically delete receipted mail; sorry. Second, if you&#146;re asking for advice, please try to keep the problem statement to a few paragraphs&#151;if it gets any more involved than that, then, well, we&#146;re sort of moving into the field of network consulting, which is partially how I make my living&#133; so I&#146;m afraid your request will be slotted to be dealt with <i>after</I> those of my contracted clients. As you&#146;ve probably guessed by now, I <i>do</I> receive a lot of mail. Much of it is highly complimentary, and I am very thankful to all of you who have corresponded! I <i>will</I> try to reply to all mail that I get&#151;and thanks again for reading!</P><p><br></P>
