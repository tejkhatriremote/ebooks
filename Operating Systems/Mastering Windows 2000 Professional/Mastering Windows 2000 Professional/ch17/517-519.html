<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading11"></A><font color="#000077">Rock-Solid Multitasking</FONT></H4>
<p>I alluded to Windows 2000&#146;s multitasking abilities earlier in the section on stability, but it&#146;s worth expanding upon. Windows 2000 is built upon a kernel (the basic engine of any operating system) that is designed to ensure that multiple tasks all get serviced. One of the benefits of multitasking is that you&#146;ll have fewer system lockups.
</P>
<p>Have you ever asked your PC to do something, only to have it freeze up? Of course, that has happened to most of us at some point. After about 30 seconds of non-response, you may as well just turn off the computer, because waiting 30 more <i>years</I> won&#146;t get any response.</P>
<p>Although system lockups are relatively infrequent with Windows 2000, you have to handle the ones that you <i>do</I> experience. Because a Windows 2000 &#147;lockup&#148; might be the result of some heavily CPU-intensive task&#151;not really a lockup at all&#151;you need to wait a minute or two before deciding that your system is dead. If Windows 2000 still refuses to respond after a time, press Ctrl+Alt+Del and choose Task Manager. You can then choose an application and terminate that application, and your system will still work.</P>
<p>I still use some Windows 3.1 applications, mainly because no one&#146;s converted them to Windows 9<i>x</I> or NT. One such application is cc:Mail, which now and then decides that whatever it&#146;s doing is the most important thing that the operating system could ever imagine doing, and so cc:Mail puts the hourglass up on the screen. The hourglass, as you know, means &#147;Wait while I finish what I&#146;m doing.&#148; You shouldn&#146;t see too much of this behavior under a modern multitasking operating system. Anyway, cc:Mail uses the hourglass far too often, which caused me to look forward to Windows 95. I figured that the multitasking engine of Windows 95 would be able to tame cc:Mail&#146;s penchant for the hourglass. Despite the advertising from Microsoft that Windows 95 would multitask Windows 3.1 programs better than Windows 3.1, I didn&#146;t see any change. The cc:Mail program continued to display the hourglass just as it had under Windows 3.1&#151;and Windows 95 ground to a halt.</P>
<p>I contacted someone inside Microsoft, asking why the hourglass was still around in cc:Mail when I ran it under Windows 95. &#147;It&#146;s just a temporary problem,&#148; I was assured. &#147;Temporary until when?&#148; I asked. &#147;Until you upgrade to a Windows 95 version of cc:Mail,&#148; the Microsoft technician replied.</P>
<p>In contrast, I started up cc:Mail under Windows 2000 and told it to do something that would normally lead to an hourglass. The hourglass appeared, but only as long as I had the cursor over the cc:Mail window. When I moved the cursor to another program, it returned to its standard arrow shape, enabling me to continue working while cc:Mail computed.</P>
<p>In another case, I was sitting at an NT Server that acted as our World Wide Web server. Two people from outside my company were on our Web site, having accessed it from the Internet, and I was using our Internet connection to FTP to Novell, where I was downloading some drivers. The FTP transfer was going to take about 10 minutes, so I amused myself by starting up a Windows 3.1-based game. The game involves a lot of animation, and NT doesn&#146;t run Windows 3.1-type animation very well. The game ran so slowly that I gave up and tried to exit from it.</P>
<p>The game didn&#146;t want me to quit!</P>
<p>&#147;Curses,&#148; I muttered, and brought up Task Manager (remember, Ctrl+Alt+Del; then click Task Manager), clicked on the game, and clicked End Task.</P>
<p>NT thought about it for a minute and then said to me, &#147;This program isn&#146;t responding to my requests for it to terminate. Shall I just force it to shut down?&#148; I thought, &#147;Hey, I enjoy pushing around small, helpless applications as much as the next guy,&#148; and so I told NT to go for it.</P>
<p>NT came back with more bad news. Basically, what it said was this: &#147;I&#146;ve tried to shut down the application, but it isn&#146;t listening to me. What I <i>can</I> do as a kind of last resort is shut down the entire NT subsystem that runs Windows 3.1-type programs, a module called <tt>WOWEXEC</TT>. Should I?&#148;</P>
<p>I hesitated. I had two outside customers on the Web server, which was a native NT application, and I was doing a lengthy FTP file transfer, which I <i>could</I> redo but didn&#146;t want to. Also, <tt>WOWEXEC</TT> is a <i>big</I> subsystem. Would zapping it affect the Web or FTP sessions? I tried it.</P>
<p>In a matter of about 15 seconds (on a 25MHz computer), <tt>WOWEXEC</TT> was back up and running, the bad application was gone, and neither my Web nor FTP sessions were interrupted. Pretty neat.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>When you configure Windows 2000 to run Windows 3.1 programs, you can tell Windows 2000 to Run in Separate Memory Space. That command sets up a private copy of <tt>WOWEXEC</TT> for each old Windows 3.1 program. If you must pull the plug on a Windows 3.1 application, then you can do it without affecting any other Windows 3.1 or 32-bit application.<hr></FONT>
