<p>The top people at Microsoft knew that they were vulnerable on a very key point: All their products ran on Intel <i>x</I>86 hardware, meaning the 8088, 80286, 80386, 80486, and eventually Pentium and Pentium Pro processors and beyond. Microsoft&#146;s fortunes, then, rode on the Intel horse, and at that time the Intel horse seemed the right one to back. But what about the future? Who could know what processor would be dominant in 10 years? Microsoft wanted to know that it would be on top no matter what processor the marketplace chose, so it needed an <i>architecture-independent</I> operating system.</P>

<table border="2" bordercolor="#0000" align="CENTER">
<tr><td><font size="+1"><b>Building an Architecture-Independent Operating System</B></FONT>
<p><i>Architecture-independent</I> doesn&#146;t mean that the product works as well in a Victorian house as it does in a Bauhaus office. Architecture independent means that it&#146;s built so that it can be modified fairly easily to work on a different processor. All of Microsoft&#146;s operating systems up to 1989 were firmly Intel entrenched, and porting any of them to another processor would have been difficult. (For example, IBM was forced to agree that portability was a problem when it announced that it had stopped work on a version of OS/2 for its PowerPC processor, a CPU of non-Intel architecture.)</P>
<p>A piece of software can easily become dependent on a particular processor because the writers of the operating system must become intimately familiar with the processor&#146;s strengths and weaknesses. Consequently, those strengths and weaknesses inevitably color a developer&#146;s sense of what&#146;s necessary and unnecessary for an operating system. For example, if you build an operating system on top of a 16-bit processor, you&#146;re probably going to make the operating system a 16-bit operating system. If the processor handles memory in chunks (<i>pages</I> is the exact word) of 4KB, as the Intel processors do, then the operating system&#146;s pages will probably turn out to be 4KB as well. Consequently, converting the operating system to a machine with 1MB pages involves massive code rewriting unless the operating system is designed with flexible page sizes in mind.</P>
</TABLE>

<p>Building an architecture-independent operating system might have been too difficult a task for Microsoft&#146;s development staff, but as luck would have it, a team of top-flight mainframe operating system designers became available in 1989. A group of former Digital Equipment Corporation programmers, led by a man named Dave Cutler, set up shop at Microsoft, promising to build the operating system of Microsoft&#146;s future. Influenced partly by an operating system called MACH, a Unix implementation created at Carnegie Mellon University, Cutler&#146;s team used a design approach that attempted to isolate all the processor-specific parts of the operating system into a single area called the <i>microkernel.</I> Most of the machine-specific parts of the operating system would live in a file called <tt>hal.dll</TT>, or the <i>Hardware Abstraction Layer</I>. The operating system would be stable, <i>carefully</I> debugged, and <i>scaleable</I>&#151;that is, able to grow to meet the requirements of the largest PCs imaginable (or, at least, imaginable in 1989).</P>
<p>Why was this approach so &#147;brave&#148; of Microsoft? Because to produce a stable and scaleable operating system, the NT team would require a PC with at least 16MB of RAM and at least a 33MHz processor, quite an expensive machine for the time. Microsoft risked spending millions of dollars on an operating system that would be seen as a sluggish memory hog if in the long run memory prices didn&#146;t come down and CPU speeds didn&#146;t go up. Memory prices <i>have</I> come down, and processors <i>have</I> become faster; 400MHz is about the minimum speed you will find on a new computer nowadays.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading4"></A><font color="#000077">The Early Releases</FONT></H4>
<p>The first version of NT wasn&#146;t named NT version 1, probably out of some marketing notion that people are scared of any software labeled version 1. The first release, called NT 3.1, was supposed to ship in late 1991 but was delayed&#151;first until early 1992 and then until late 1992; it finally shipped in July of 1993. This version of NT was dubbed NT Workstation 3.1 to distinguish it from its server sibling NT Advanced Server. NT Workstation 3.1 didn&#146;t sell all that well&#151;mainly because it required a fairly expensive PC to run it and it lacked software. Despite the weak sales, NT got high marks from its users. I don&#146;t think I <i>ever</I> remember any of its detractors pointing to its bugs&#151;because there were hardly any. I recall skeptically loading NT onto a few of my workstations and being pleasantly surprised at its stability&#151;very few bugs and very stable multitasking.</P>
<p>About 14 months later, NT version 3.5 appeared in server and workstation configurations. NT Advanced Server had been renamed NT Server without the <i>Advanced</I> because people looked at its &#36;1,500.00 price tag and said, &#147;Hey, that&#146;s a lot of money, and I don&#146;t need that much power; where do I find the <i>basic</I> Server?&#148; Again in version 3.5, the NT team showed its commitment to high-quality, bug-free software. Very few features had been added&#151;just some improvements in the TCP/IP software and in NetWare connectivity tools. The NT development team had worked for a little more than a year, and what had it done? Simple: Instead of adding pointless features, the programmers focused on fixing bugs and tightening up the operating system. It got a little leaner, a little faster, and a bit more stable.</P>
<p>In the early summer of 1995, yet another version of NT appeared&#151;version 3.51. Version 3.51 again produced very few new features. PCMCIA support, a client license management system, and file compression were the main new items. NT version 3.51 seemed a bit less stable, as evidenced by Microsoft&#146;s release of <i>three</I> Service Packs (that is, groups of files that patch up the operating system and repair bugs&#151;in other words, bug fixes) for it by the end of 1995.</P>
<p>After 3.51&#146;s introduction, another Microsoft operating system appeared, Windows 95. Like NT, it claimed to be a 32-bit OS and sported a shiny new user interface and some new network management tools. Users soon wanted to know when NT would reach parity with Windows 95&#146;s features.</P>
<p>The answer to that question was, of course, &#147;Soon,&#148; and NT 4 was the down payment on that promise. Windows 2000 has carried on with that promise to provide many of the features formerly the exclusive domain of Windows 9<i>x</I>.</P><p><br></P>
