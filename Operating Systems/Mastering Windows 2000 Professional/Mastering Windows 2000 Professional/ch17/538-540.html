<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading26"></A><font color="#000077">Make Sure the Drivers You Want to Use Appear on the HCL</FONT></H4>
<p>The <i>good</I> part of the HCL is that it includes a list of tested and approved video boards, SCSI host adapters, and LAN boards, among other things. Therefore, even if your machines aren&#146;t on the HCL, you can still use the HCL to choose add-in cards for those machines.</P>
<p>Additionally, it&#146;s not a bad idea to get onto the peripheral vendor&#146;s Web site and check out its Windows 2000-driver support. The truth of the matter is that writing NT drivers is often a third- or fourth-order issue for hardware vendors&#151;writing DOS and Windows drivers are the highest priorities. Some sites seem to keep releasing newer and newer beta drivers for NT, promising the final version soon. The unified driver model in Windows 2000 should help to relieve some of this, as the drivers for Windows 2000 are usually the same as the drivers for Windows 98.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>As someone who&#146;s spent far too much of my life waiting around for OS/2 drivers to appear, take my advice: Do not buy a piece of peripheral hardware for Windows 2000 until you can get final drivers for Windows 2000 and the hardware is on the HCL.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>But be sure that the peripheral drivers are supported for your computer architecture. I met a fellow in class who&#146;d been trying for weeks to get a particular network card to work in his NT 4 MIPS-based server. Because the card was a PCI board, it could be used in an Intel-based system, a MIPS system, an Alpha system, or a PowerPC system. The board, similarly, was on the HCL.
</P>
<p>After calling the board vendor and Microsoft for weeks, he finally got an answer: The board&#146;s on the HCL, yes, but only for the Intel platform. The manufacturer had not yet written drivers for the MIPS machine.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>So my second piece of advice is this: If you&#146;re buying a RISC-based machine, buy the entire machine as a package from the vendor, and get a guarantee of Windows 2000 compatibility.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>If you&#146;ve been using PC-compatible computers for years, then you&#146;ve been sheltered from the reality that users of Macintoshes, Amigas, Atari 1040s, and RISC machines are reminded of every day: Non-PC markets are so small that you cannot and should not assume <i>anything</I> about support and compatibility. If you&#146;re buying RISC machines, check everything once, twice, and three times, and <i>get it all in writing</I>. RISC machines are amazingly fast and wonderful when they work, but they can be so frustrating when they don&#146;t. And another thing to keep in mind: A small market doesn&#146;t sell enough software to support the kind of development effort that Microsoft puts into Windows 2000. The platform support in Windows 2000 may be very different from the platform support in the future.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading27"></A><font color="#000077">Wait for Your Top Three Apps to Be Native</FONT></H4>
<p>Windows 2000 is very compatible with older operating systems. Yes, but running a DOS program under Windows 2000 still isn&#146;t running a DOS program under DOS&#151;it&#146;s running a DOS program under a DOS emulator. You are being unfair and unreasonable if you say to a vendor of some DOS program, &#147;I&#146;m running your application that I bought from you last year under Windows 2000, and it&#146;s not running right. It ran fine under DOS. What do I do?&#148; The vendor never promised that the application would run under the DOS emulator in Windows 2000. And, truthfully, if it runs under DOS (or Windows 3.1) and doesn&#146;t run under the Windows 2000 emulators of those two operating systems, then the problem is in the DOS or Windows 3.1 emulators in Windows 2000, not in the DOS application.
</P>
<p>For an occasionally used DOS or Windows 3.1 program, using Windows 2000 is fine. But I wouldn&#146;t think about switching over to a Windows 2000 machine full time (and didn&#146;t) until my most important applications supported Windows 2000 directly; otherwise, as I&#146;ve indicated, you&#146;re running without support.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Minasi&#146;s law of operating systems: Do not move to a new desktop operating system until your top three applications have released stable versions that are native to the new operating system.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Now, what <i>are</I> your top three applications? For most of us, the top one is word processing. People reflexively say that spreadsheets are their second-most-used application, but I wonder about that. Personally, I spend <i>lots</I> more time in my e-mail application than I do my spreadsheet; I use the Web all the time for researching computer topics, and so I&#146;d have to say that my third-most-used application is probably my Web browser.</P>
<p>Now that I&#146;ve written that, I notice that Windows 2000 goes a long way toward making a place for itself in my heart (and my PC), because it contains both an Internet-enabled e-mail client and a Web browser. The Outlook Express e-mail client that ships with Windows 2000 can access Internet e-mail even if your company doesn&#146;t use Exchange Server. For those who speak the language, the Outlook Express client can act as a POP3 client, like the popular Eudora and Pegasus e-mail programs. The Web browser has shaped up to be a fine tool, and it&#146;s free. As for 32-bit word processing, well, I haven&#146;t found any <i>great</I> packages yet, but both Lotus&#146;s WordPro and Microsoft Word are available in 32-bit versions.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading28"></A><font color="#000077">Make Sure the Apps Work</FONT></H4>
<p>Painful experience reminds us that just because an application <i>claims</I> to work under a particular operating system doesn&#146;t mean that it actually <i>runs</I> under that operating system. Before you buy a thousand copies for Windows 2000 and install them on your employees&#146; PCs, get a few machines, build a small network, and run the applications for a while. Then when you&#146;ve found the particular quirks caused by running Windows 2000 (assuming that there <i>are</I> any; it&#146;s not a foregone conclusion), you can make an informed decision about whether to move everyone in your organization to Windows 2000.</P><p><br></P>
