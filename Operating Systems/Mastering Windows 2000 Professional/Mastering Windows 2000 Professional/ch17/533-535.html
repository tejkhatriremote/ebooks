<p>Chip emulation is a sort of heroic thing. The notion is that you want to run a program written for chip <i>X</I> on a computer based on chip <i>Y</I>. To compensate, you run a program on chip <i>Y</I> that reads instructions for chip <i>X</I>, translates them into the corresponding instructions for chip <i>Y</I>, and then executes those instructions. Imagine holding a conversation with someone in Italian when you speak English with the assistance of a simultaneous translator. You look at the Italian speaker rather than the translator; the translator looks at you and then at the person who speaks Italian. You can definitely have a conversation, but it&#146;s at a much slower pace than if you spoke Italian. You&#146;ll see the same thing if you ever try to run a DOS or Windows 3.1 application on a RISC-based computer: The job gets done but on a more geological time scale than you&#146;d like.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading23"></A><font color="#000077">Problems Related to NT&#146;s PC Legacy</FONT></H4>
<p>Some of the things that Windows 2000 does are just plain dumb because it&#146;s missing relatively simple and eminently possible features that Microsoft hasn&#146;t taken the time to implement. Don&#146;t misunderstand this statement&#151;most of the items in this section are not things that Microsoft has promised at any time. But I think they would make Windows 2000 much more useful.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>File Associations Rely on File Extensions</B></FONT></P>
<p>When you open a folder, you may see files with the PowerPoint, Excel, or Word icons attached to them. If you double-click the icon, Windows 2000 automatically starts up the application and feeds the file to the application. But how does Windows 2000 know that the file <tt>household.xls</TT> is an Excel spreadsheet? By its .<tt>xls</TT> file extension. This is a dumb idea for a number of reasons.</P>
<p>First, now that both Windows 95 and Windows 2000 support long filenames&#151;names that have up to 255 characters with spaces and uppercase and lowercase letters&#151;saving files with names like <tt>portfolio analysis done on 3 March 1996</TT> makes sense<i>;</I> having to add .<tt>xls</TT> to the end of the filename is cumbersome.</P>
<p>Second, some file extensions could be in doubt. Who ever said that Microsoft Word should own the extension .<tt>doc</TT>? Lots of people that I know use the .<tt>doc</TT> extension for their WordPerfect documents. What, then, do they do if they want to load both Microsoft Word and WordPerfect on the same computer?</P>
<p>Windows 2000 supports the notion of <i>file forking</I> whereby a file contains two pieces: the data file and a small program, what Macintosh users call a <i>resource fork</I>. The resource fork is a little program that says, &#147;To use me, run program <i>XYZ</I>.&#148; Thus, all Microsoft Word documents would get a resource fork that says, &#147;To use me, run Microsoft Word.&#148; This convention would free us from file extensions and make the user interface considerably more user-intelligible. The PC world is one wherein we always seem be to hearing, &#147;What&#146;s that? The tool we built for you doesn&#146;t fit your hand? Hmmm&#133;have you considered surgery?&#148;</P>
<p>Perhaps most embarrassing for Microsoft is (or <i>should</I> be) the fact that IBM included file forking with OS/2 way back in 1992.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Operating System Components Are Largely Static</B></FONT></P>
<p>Run Windows 2000 for a while, and you&#146;ll be pleasantly surprised at how stable it is. So stable, in fact, that the only reason that I ever reboot my Windows 2000 Server machines is to add or remove a module. Some of the slightest modifications to your configuration cause Windows 2000 to demand that you reboot the system.
</P>
<p>There&#146;s no real reason to require rebooting, either. Modern mainframe and minicomputer operating systems go for months at a time without being rebooted. You can load new system software and keep on going. The big-iron folks abandoned the notion of a heavily static operating system more than a decade ago. Nevertheless, it persists in the microcomputer world as just another thing that seems to be acceptable.</P>
<p>Boot Windows 2000 and you can see why I feel that it&#146;s imperative for Microsoft to do something about how slowly their computers boot up. You can wait for 10 minutes for NT 4 to start a workstation with a whole bunch of drivers and services, and of course, demonstrating a slow startup on an NT Server machine is even easier. Now, Windows 2000 <i>is</I> faster than NT 4 at booting, but some of us are never really satisfied when it comes to boot speed. All that is really required to reset Windows 2000 during the installation of software is to stop and restart the devices and services involved in what you installed, so why doesn&#146;t someone write their program to stop and restart the services instead of requiring a reboot?</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Shortcuts Don&#146;t Link Two Ways</B></FONT></P>
<p>One of the features of the Windows 2000 graphical user interface is the <i>shortcut</I>. Shortcuts are small files with the extension .<tt>lnk</TT>; they are usually smaller than 200 bytes. The value of a shortcut is that it provides a quick way to access some file or program.</P>
<p>For example, suppose you want to start up Microsoft Word. The program itself is probably named <tt>C:\MSOffice\Winword\Winword</TT>. So to start it up, you might open My Computer, then the C drive, then the MSOffice folder, then the Winword folder, and then finally double-click the <tt>winword.exe</TT> icon. But that&#146;s a lot of folder-diving. Instead, you could create a shortcut from <tt>C:\MSOffice\Winword\Winword</TT> by putting an icon on the Desktop for Microsoft Word. That new icon is the shortcut. Double-click the shortcut, and Word starts; so far, so good.</P>
<p>But this process falls down when you want to examine or change the properties of the <tt>winword.exe</TT> file. Right-click the <tt>winword.exe</TT> file, and you&#146;ll get the option to examine the properties of that file; one of the tabs on the properties sheet will let you examine property data such as the file&#146;s version and trademarks. But try right-clicking the shortcut and all you&#146;ll get is an offer to find the original item. So, to modify the properties of Microsoft Word from a shortcut, you&#146;ve got to bring up the properties of the shortcut, which then offers you the opportunity to bring up the properties of the original file, an extra and annoying step.</P>
<p>In contrast, a truly object-oriented operating system would support shortcuts that act exactly like their original objects (objects such as Microsoft Word). Again, this feature <i>isn&#146;t</I> rocket science, as OS/2 included it back in 1992.</P><p><br></P>
