<p>In more than 20 years of experience with microcomputer operating systems, I&#146;ve seen a number of really good products go down in flames through no fault of their own, save for one thing: They never saw enough acceptance. Although it&#146;s true that most Windows 9<i>x</I> applications run under Windows 2000, a system requires more than applications. For example, drivers must be available to run for every piece of hardware that the application needs.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Fewer Drivers Are Available</B></FONT></P>
<p>Running your video board, network card, mouse, SCSI host adapter, or scanner requires a piece of software called a driver. Someone must sit down and write a driver program for each piece of hardware in your system. Of course, Windows 2000 includes drivers right in the box for major pieces of hardware. But what about not-so-major pieces of hardware? For example, although obtaining a driver for the 3Com Ethernet board is easy enough, can you get one for the SMC Ethernet cards? And even if a major vendor, such as 3Com, comes out with a new card after Windows 2000 ships, will anyone write a Windows 2000 driver for that board?
</P>
<p>The relatively small number of available drivers is definitely one of NT&#146;s main weaknesses. Windows 2000 uses the same drivers as Windows 98 for <i>most</I> of its hardware, but not all. It includes a new version of the Network Device Interface Specification (NDIS) drivers for network cards. Now this isn&#146;t as bad as it may sound. In this case, the driver for Windows 98 works fine, but the information (<tt>.inf</TT>) file that tells Windows 2000 how to install the driver is in a different format.</P>
<p>The things to check out before you commit to Windows 2000 are usually the drivers for your video card and sound card. SCSI and network card drivers are more plentiful, but you can&#146;t be positive that the generic Sound Blaster 16 driver will work on your Sound Blaster clone. Unless you&#146;re using a Microsoft or Logitech mouse, check for Windows 2000 mouse drivers as well. Or restrict your purchases to devices on the Microsoft Hardware Compatibility List.</P>
<p>Now, after all the gloom, it has to be said that driver support for Windows 2000 is getting better all the time. If in doubt, check the Web site for the company that made your hardware. There have been many cases lately where the support staff for a company tells you that a driver for NT isn&#146;t available, and then you find one right on their Web site! The moral here is that everyone, including Microsoft, has been surprised by the rapid acceptance of NT as the operating system of choice by savvy users, and we can expect that to continue with Windows 2000.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Not All Windows 9<i>x</I> Apps Run
</B></FONT></P>
<p>NT 4 did not include much support for Microsoft&#146;s game API DirectX, so there were many games and other applications that would not run correctly, or not run at all under NT. Windows 2000 includes the full DirectX 7 API set, so this should no longer be a major issue for new users of Windows 2000. But there will still be issues if applications are written to look for a specific version of Windows. For instance, if a program is written to only run on Windows 95 by name, it won&#146;t run on Windows 2000. It probably won&#146;t even run on Windows 98 for that matter.
</P>
<p>Additionally, many application programmers just plain haven&#146;t figured out the correct way to write a 32-bit application, so they cobble together some of the 16-bit things that they&#146;ve already written and understand and wrap a bit of 32-bit code around it, calling the result a Windows 95 application. Before you know it, Windows 95 is out of memory and you end up with a Windows 95 application that doesn&#146;t run under Windows 2000.</P>

</FONT></H4>
<p>Although Windows 9<i>x</I> certainly isn&#146;t the benchmark of quality for operating systems, it has one great strength when compared to NT and most other operating systems: its hardware support. Windows 9<i>x</I> makes installing new hardware considerably easier than it ever was; unfortunately, NT doesn&#146;t share that strength.</P><p><br></P>
