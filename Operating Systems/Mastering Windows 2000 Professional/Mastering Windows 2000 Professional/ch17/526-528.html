<p>Reassigning resources would be a problem because all the driver programs that are such an important part of Windows 2000 (and, for that matter, <i>any</I> operating system) must figure out what resources each board uses. Also, any Plug-and-Play-compliant operating system must be able to take the self-identification information provided by each Plug-and-Play expansion board and use it to choose drivers automatically. For example, suppose you install a 3Com 3C590 Ethernet card, which is a Plug-and-Play card, into your PC. The Configuration Manager sets its resources automatically, but then how do you tell the operating system to load the driver for a 3Com 3C590? Well, in a perfect world, you don&#146;t want to have to tell the operating system <i>anything</I>; it should figure it out for itself&#151;and a Plug-and-Play-compliant operating system does just that.</P>
<p>Windows 2000 includes Plug-and-Play support. For long time users of Windows NT that statement bears repeating: Windows 2000 has Plug-and-Play! No more suffering through the mysteries of manual configuration when installing a new piece of hardware in your computer. After installing the hardware, all you have to do is boot the computer and Plug-and-Play should take care of the rest.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Partial Plug-and-Play Systems</B></FONT></P>
<p>So, to review: If you have a non-Plug-and-Play system, you configure all the boards by hand, make notes on what memory addresses, I/O addresses, IRQ levels, and DMA channels each board uses, and relay that information to each of the drivers that you must load. If you have a Plug-and-Play system, then the system configures itself. Each Plug-and-Play board can communicate its configuration to the corresponding driver.
</P>
<p>But what about this fairly common configuration: a Plug-and-Play system with a number of non-Plug-and-Play boards? If your computer has both PCI and Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) slots&#151;which is the case for most PCs nowadays&#151;then virtually all your PCI boards are Plug and Play and virtually all your ISA boards are <i>not</I> Plug and Play. Thus the ISA boards must be configured by hand. In other words, the PCI boards configure themselves without even asking for your opinion, and the ISA boards sit mutely waiting for your instructions.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Not all ISA boards are Plug-and-Play unaware. In fact, a number of ISA boards provide Plug-and-Play configuration. Examples include the Intel and 3Com ISA Ethernet cards and the Creative Laboratories Plug-and-Play 16-bit sound card. But the vast majority of ISA boards have no Plug-and-Play capability and must be configured by hand.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Suppose you configure one of your ISA boards to use IRQ10. The Configuration Manager, which knows nothing of the ISA boards, happens to assign one of the PCI boards to IRQ10. Result: instant, automatic conflict. What to do?
</P>
<p>Some well-designed computers (Compaq is the premier example) have a user-configurable Configuration Manager that you can just plain tell to &#147;stay away from IRQ10.&#148; Unfortunately, most computers aren&#146;t that well built, so here&#146;s my advice.</P>
<p>First, remove the ISA boards. Leave in the PCI boards and boot the system under DOS or Windows 9<i>x</I>. Let the Configuration Manager configure the PCI cards. Then you can find out which resources the PCI cards used by examining the Windows 9<i>x</I> Device Manager. The Device Manager can be found in the Windows 9<i>x</I> Control Panel in System/Device Manager.</P>
<p>You can also run a DOS-based Plug-and-Play manager, which you can get from Intel or from the manufacturer of your PC. After you know where the PCI boards have settled, configure the ISA boards in the remaining resources. In effect, you let the PCI boards do whatever they want and then make the ISA boards tiptoe around them.</P>
<p>As you can see, configuring a Plug-and-Play system without a Plug-and-Play operating system makes the task more like &#147;plug and pray&#148; than Plug and Play.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Hot-Plug-and-Play Support</B></FONT></P>
<p>Another neat feature of Windows 9<i>x</I> is <i>Hot</I> Plug and Play<i>,</I> which is useful in laptops with PCMCIA/PC Card slots.</P>
<p>If I turn on my laptop computer without a network card in it, then Windows 95 does not load any network software. But if I insert a PCMCIA/PC network card into my system after it&#146;s booted up, the Configuration Manager recognizes that the network card needs network drivers. Then all the network software loads without the need for a reboot.</P>
<p>Hot Plug and Play is a neat feature for Windows 9<i>x</I>, and is a feature that is shared by Windows 2000. When I insert a PCMCIA adapter into my laptop, Windows 2000 recognizes the device, installs the driver (if needed) and starts using the device. Be careful, though. Some devices really don&#146;t like hot swapping. For that reason, there is an icon in your System Tray to prepare your PCMCIA cards for ejection.</P><p><br></P>
