<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading12"></A><font color="#000077">Built-In Networking</FONT></H4>
<p>Up until about 1992, most microcomputer operating systems incorporated networking as a kind of afterthought, a set of programs grafted onto an existing operating system. Consequently, networking was always an iffy thing because usually the people who wrote the networking code (Novell programmers, for most users) were not the same people who wrote the operating system code (Microsoft folks, usually). Trying to resolve network problems became a useless exercise in finger pointing.
</P>
<p>For example, people who ran Novell&#146;s network requester software on top of Windows 3.1 sometimes ran into what became known as the black screen of death, or BSOD. When they&#146;d try to open a DOS prompt, they&#146;d get only a black text screen with a cursor blinking in the upper-left corner and the system would lock up.</P>
<p>For more than a year, Novell claimed that such a problem didn&#146;t exist. Microsoft, likewise, claimed that no such problem existed. Then, after some time, Microsoft announced that the BSOD <i>did</I> exist, that it was due to a bug in Novell&#146;s software, and further that Microsoft had magnanimously developed a fix. At almost the same time, Novell similarly announced that the BSOD existed, that it had been the fault of Microsoft code all along, and that Novell had developed a fix.</P>
<p>Under Windows 2000, networking isn&#146;t an add-on feature that you&#146;ve got to figure out how to fit into place. It&#146;s part of the operating system from the very beginning. An integrated network feature doesn&#146;t guarantee that bugs won&#146;t pop up from time to time, but it <i>does</I> seem to indicate that the appearance of bugs is less likely.</P>
<p>Right out of the box, Windows 2000 can communicate with NT Servers and Windows 2000 Servers&#151;no big surprise. But Windows 2000 can also communicate with NetWare 3.<i>x</I>, 4.<i>x</I>, and 5.<i>x</I> servers. Windows 2000 also contains a number of Internet-related programs, including an FTP client, a Web browser, and a mail client that can access Internet POP3 mail servers. I do have a bit of bad news about the NetWare client, though; it cannot run client-side Virtual Loadable Modules (VLM), programs that would appear in a client-server system based on NetWare servers.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading13"></A><font color="#000077">Rich Potential Application Base</FONT></H4>
<p>Will Windows 2000 catch on enough to produce the wealth of word processors, games, e-mail packages, and development tools that we&#146;re beginning to see for Windows 9<i>x</I>? Sure, because <i>Windows 95 applications are Windows 2000 applications</I>. In other words, a Windows 95 programming interface is a Windows 2000 programming interface; the systems share a programming interface called <i>Win32</I>.</P>
<p>Well, that&#146;s the theory, anyway. The truth of the matter is that you&#146;ll find a number of NT apps that don&#146;t run under Windows 9<i>x</I> and a number of Windows 9<i>x</I> apps that don&#146;t run under NT. But the vast majority, at least 95 percent, of the Win32 applications run fine under both NT and Windows 9<i>x</I>. This should be even better in Windows 2000, since the NT APIs have been around for a while, and because Windows 2000 supports more of the APIs that used to be unique to Windows 9<i>x</I>. Games in particular should run better on Windows 2000 than they did on NT 4.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading14"></A><font color="#000077">Complete Error Recording</FONT></H4>
<p>Ever had a message appear on the screen while you booted a DOS or Windows 95 workstation, only to have the message scroll off the screen before you could read it? You won&#146;t have to endure this particular frustration under Windows 2000, because all important system messages are written to one of three logs: the System log, the Security log, and the Applications log. You view all three of them with an application called the Event Viewer, which is in the Administrative Tools menu.
</P>
<p>Event Viewer messages are not always the most useful things in the whole world, but you&#146;ll sometimes be able to get a lot of information out of them. Well-written applications (you <i>did</I> catch the weasel words <i>well-written,</I> didn&#146;t you?) write useful information into the Applications log, so put &#147;uses the Applications log&#148; on your list of things to look for when buying 32-bit applications for Windows 2000. It is interesting that one of the features that Microsoft is noting for Windows 2000 is new clearly written error messages. So far, the messages we&#146;ve seen in testing have been remarkably easy to work with.</P><p><br></P>
