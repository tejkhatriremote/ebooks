<h3><a name="Heading5"></A><font color="#000077">Strengths New to Windows 2000</FONT></H3>
<p>Windows 2000&#146;s strengths aren&#146;t as glossy as <i>Includes multimedia support</I> or <i>Comes with some nice games,</I> although those things are true. Basically, people who like NT like it for a simple reason: It&#146;s stable and secure, sort of the Volvo of operating systems. But Windows 2000&#146;s strengths go beyond stability and security. Let&#146;s first look at the features that would interest an old-time NT user and then look at things that would compel a Windows 9<i>x</I> user to switch to Windows 2000.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading6"></A><font color="#000077">Advanced Graphical User Interface (GUI)</FONT></H4>
<p>Since the invention of the graphical user interface (GUI) in 1972, we&#146;ve seen a good number of attempts to define and build the perfect GUI. The Xerox PARC Alto system was the first to have a GUI, and all others have contained something of that operating system&#146;s ideas. Apple&#146;s Macintosh is well known, but not as well known as the Lisa, an earlier computer that didn&#146;t sell very well. Microsoft&#146;s Windows 1, 2, 3, and 95 all used different GUIs, each trying to improve the previous incarnation. IBM&#146;s OS/2 version 2 introduced a well-designed GUI that was also built out of <i>objects</I>, a programming technique that Microsoft sadly has yet to master. An object-oriented GUI for NT probably won&#146;t appear until after Windows 2000 makes its debut.</P>
<p>Although the Windows 95 GUI isn&#146;t the best one the market has ever seen, it&#146;s not bad, particularly when compared with the GUI of NT 3.51. In fact, the main reason that NT 4 exists is that Microsoft wanted to get the Windows 95 GUI on top of NT. Even Windows 2000 is carrying that idea forward, having started with the same GUI as Windows 98 with Internet Explorer integrated into the user interface. Windows 2000 has moved beyond Windows 98 with the interface, adding a cleaner feel and greater ability to customize the appearance of the shell.</P>
<p>The new GUI is not only a matter of attractiveness; it also supports the Windows 95 interface, which will enable software vendors to write programs that behave the same under Windows 9<i>x</I> and Windows 2000. Not <i>all</I> programs, however&#151;some of the Lotus SmartSuite 96 programs, for example, won&#146;t run in both environments. But <i>many</I> 32-bit programs will.</P>
<p>The new GUI consists of a number of elements:</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>The Explorer</B>
<dd>The program that manages the GUI.
<dt><b>The Taskbar</B>
<dd>The gray bar across the bottom of the screen (although it can be moved around). It contains icons representing all active programs, the clock, and various utilities.
<dt><b>The Start menu</B>
<dd>A one-button approach to accessing programs, Help, and systems settings.
</DL>

<p>If you&#146;ve used Windows 9<i>x</I>, then this GUI will seem familiar, save for the Control Panel, which handles networking and device support differently&#151;but you&#146;ll learn more about the Control Panel later in the book.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading7"></A><font color="#000077">Multiple Hardware Profiles</FONT></H4>
<p>NT&#146;s slow acceptance of PCMCIA Cards and Plug and Play (see the later section &#147;Windows 2000 Weaknesses&#148;) has meant some real annoyances for mobile NT users. If you use NT on a laptop with a docking station, then you may have a board such as a SCSI host adapter in that docking station. But when you use NT on the road, you don&#146;t have the SCSI adapter in the system. And when NT tries to initialize the SCSI adapter, it fails, leading to error messages and slower booting.
</P>
<p>Windows 2000 does include Plug-and-Play support, and much greater support of PC Cards (PCMCIA). Running Windows 2000 on a laptop computer is much more practical than running NT was. You can still use hardware profiles, but the Plug-and-Play support will detect whether a particular device is present or not when the computer boots.</P>
<p>As for PC Cards, it&#146;s easy to add or remove PC Card devices without having to reboot. Add to that the fact that Windows 2000 pre-copies the files for device drivers to the hard drive, and you&#146;ll find that installing a new device is a snap.</P><p><br></P>
