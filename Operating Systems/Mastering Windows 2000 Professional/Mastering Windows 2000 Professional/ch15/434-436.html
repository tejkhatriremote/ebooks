<h3><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">Setting Up Your Communications System</FONT></H3>
<p>In most cases, you&#146;ll be using HyperTerminal to communicate across a telephone line. You might connect to the Internet, to a commercial dial-up service (such as CompuServe, Dow Jones News/Retrieval, the Source, or MCI Mail), or you might call up a friend&#146;s or colleague&#146;s computer to exchange files. The other computer can even be of a different type, such as a Macintosh.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B><i>Telecommunications</I> is the term used for communication over telephone lines or via cellular phone systems.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>To communicate in this way from a distance via the telephone line (as opposed to communications between computers connected directly with a cable), you need a modem. A <i>modem</I> is a device that provides the electronic connection between a computer and the phone line. The modem attached to your computer converts digital information from the computer into an analog signal that travels over the phone line. On the other end of the line, the receiving modem does just the reverse (see Figure 15.2). <i>Modem</I> stands for <i>modulator/demodulator</I>, as the process of converting digital information to an analog signal is called <i>modulation</I>.</P>

<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-03.jpg',500,224)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 15.2</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;A telecommunications setup, which consists of two computers, two modems, and interconnecting wires</P>
<p>Though you can always run the HyperTerminal program to experiment with it, you can&#146;t use it over the phone line without a modem. To connect with a modem, you need either
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;An external modem, a cable, an unused serial port (where you plug the cable into your computer), and an unused COM port (the electronics that permit communications at a specific computer <i>address</I>)
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or an internal modem installed inside your computer and an unused COM port
</DL>
<p>In either case, the general installation procedures are similar. You install the modem, plug your telephone line into it, and run a communications program (in this case, HyperTerminal).
</P>
<p>The main distinguishing factor among modems is the speed at which they can transfer data over the phone lines. As of this writing, modems that transmit data at 56,000 bits per second are the most popular, though many slower modems are still in use and faster ones are available. (When it comes to bits-per-second ratings, the larger the number, the faster the transmission.)</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>You&#146;re likely to see the word <i>baud</I> used as a synonym for bits per second as a rating of modem speed. Technically, the two terms aren&#146;t strictly synonymous, and you can avoid confusion by sticking with <i>bits per second (bps)</I>.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Because we can&#146;t cover all the ins and outs of modem purchasing here, we&#146;ll leave the purchase and installation details to you. Comparative reviews in computer magazines are a great source of up-to-date consumer information. But here are a few quick pointers: in theory, of course, the faster the modem, the better. But buying a brand-new, super-fast unit won&#146;t do you any good unless the modem on the <i>other</I> end of the line is equally fast&#151;so don&#146;t overspend. And don&#146;t let anyone sell you a modem that&#146;s not Hayes-compatible. Fortunately, most modems are.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B><i>Hayes compatibility</I> lets you take advantage of some useful features of HyperTerminal (and most other communications programs) such as automatically dialing the phone for you, redialing busy numbers, and so on.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>On the other hand, if you somehow acquire a modem that isn&#146;t Hayes compatible, you can probably still use HyperTerminal because other popular modem types&#151;such as MultiTech and TrailBlazer models&#151;are also supported.
</P>
<p>Make sure you follow the instructions in the modem&#146;s manual and have your modem connected to, or installed in, your computer properly before continuing. Incorrect modem installation (most often caused by improper switch settings) is a frequent cause of communications problems.</P>
<p>After the modem is installed, Windows 2000 should be able to set it up properly for you. If there&#146;s a glitch in the setup process, the most likely solution is to change the settings manually for the COM port to which you&#146;ve connected the modem. Of course, you&#146;ll need to know which COM port that is. Beyond that, Chapter 27, &#147;Supporting New Hardware and Installing Drivers,&#148; will point you in the right direction when it comes to manually configuring the ports.</P><p><br></P>
