<p><big><big>T</BIG></BIG>he HyperTerminal program supplied with Windows 2000 lets you and your PC contact other computers to exchange or retrieve information. With HyperTerminal and the right hookups, you can communicate with other computers whether they are in your house, around the block, or on the other side of the world. The kinds of information you might share in this way run the gamut from electronic mail to instant stock quotes to complete document files (such as word processing or spreadsheet documents). More and more people use communications programs to connect to their company&#146;s computer so that they can work from home&#151;a style of work called <i>telecommuting.</I></P>
<p>You can access countless types of information with your PC and a communications program such as HyperTerminal. By now, everyone has heard of the Internet, a web-like international network of computers that became the most talked-about telecommunications phenomenon of the &#146;90s. If you subscribe to an Internet access service, you can tap news, scientific data, and commentary and discussions on almost any topic imaginable via HyperTerminal. Commercial information (online) services such as CompuServe, Prodigy, and Genie offer a lot of information, too, but they also provide shopping, investing, and even dating services. Nowadays, many clubs and organizations have their own dial-up Bulletin Board Systems (BBSs) where members can leave messages and read notices of interest. Numerous BBSs also provide a wide variety of public-domain software and shareware that anyone with a computer, a modem, and a communications program can have just for the taking.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Working with HyperTerminal</FONT></H3>
<p>We&#146;ll get into the details of how to operate HyperTerminal in a moment, after a summary of the steps required to set up your system for telecommunications. HyperTerminal needs a different setup to communicate with each connection (information service, BBS, computer, or what have you). But after you&#146;ve set up a given connection, connecting again is as simple as selecting an icon in the HyperTerminal folder on the Start menu. In the example on the next page, the user is just a double-click away from the Internet, CompuServe, MCI Mail, and the chemistry lab at the university.
</P>
<p>HyperTerminal is usually set up to display its Dial dialog box (or the prerequisite setup dialog boxes) when the program starts. For this reason, you may not see HyperTerminal&#146;s main window for a while. Just so you&#146;ll know, Figure 15.1 shows how the main window looks. Like many other Windows 2000 programs, it has a toolbar at the top that is full of buttons for one-click access to common commands. At the bottom is the status bar, which keeps you informed of the progress of your communications session. (You can shut off the toolbar and status bar if you prefer&#151;see the &#147;Controlling the HyperTerminal Display&#148; section.)</P>

<p>Help is available by choosing Help <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-01i.jpg"> Help topics. Within dialog boxes, you can click the Help button at the upper-right and then click a button or setting of interest to get a quick Help message.</P>
<p>Finally, an explanation is in order here: The information in this chapter is necessarily somewhat general. Because a communications program such as HyperTerminal can be used to connect to an almost endless variety of information services and computers, it&#146;s impossible to cover all the specific situations. What&#146;s more, each service typically has its own way of logging on, transmitting and receiving files, and so on, which adds another complication. So, instead of demonstrating exact procedures, this chapter discusses all the aspects of the HyperTerminal program and explains the general steps you have to understand to use it effectively.</P>

<table border="2" bordercolor="#0000" align="CENTER">
<tr><td><font size="+1"><b>For Windows 3.x and NT 3.x Users</B></FONT>
<p>If you&#146;ve been relying on the Terminal program supplied with previous versions of NT or Windows, making the transition to HyperTerminal will be easy. But before you decide to switch to HyperTerminal, you should compare the two programs to see which best fits your needs. You may find that sticking with Terminal makes more sense, especially if you&#146;re already familiar with how it works.
</P>
<p>Although HyperTerminal offers a few meaty improvements over Terminal, most of the changes have to do with making your communications sessions easier and better looking. On the other hand, some of Terminal&#146;s most useful features aren&#146;t available in HyperTerminal.</P>
<p>One thing you won&#146;t sacrifice if you stick with Terminal is speed: When it comes to telecommunications, the limiting factor is modem speed, which is always far less than the speed of your software.</P>
<p>The most important additions to HyperTerminal are the new file-transfer protocols, especially Zmodem. Zmodem&#146;s speed, its capability to communicate the name and size of a file, and its talent for recovering gracefully from interruptions make it the best of the widely used protocols. Zmodem&#146;s absence from Terminal is that program&#146;s Achilles&#146; heel.</P>
<p>Another substantive improvement is in the area of complicated dialing sequences. Although Terminal can remember a phone number in each setup file, there is no way to configure Terminal to automatically access outside lines, dial credit-card numbers, or shut off call-waiting. HyperTerminal does all this with aplomb.</P>
<p>Other new features address convenience and cosmetics. For example, the toolbar buttons are a nice addition for one-click access to commands, and the reorganization of settings into a group of concise tabbed dialog boxes is much less confusing for the newcomer.</P>
<p>Now comes the bad news. If you&#146;re used to Terminal, here&#146;s what you&#146;ll miss in HyperTerminal:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>Function key commands</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In Terminal, you can assign sequences of commands and typed characters to the function keys on your keyboard and then play back the command sequences by pressing the keys. For example, you can assign to a function key the sequence of characters you have to type each time you log on to an online service or BBS (usually your name or ID number and a password). This can be a big time-saver if you telecommunicate frequently. HyperTerminal has no comparable feature.
<dd><b>The ability to view text files from within the program</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;HyperTerminal lacks Terminal&#146;s View Text File command, meaning you have to switch to another application such as Notepad or WordPad to examine disk files (so you can figure out which one to send, for example).
<dd><b>The ability to send selected text without copying it to the Clipboard first</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Terminal&#146;s Edit menu has a Send command for selected text, but HyperTerminal lacks a counterpart.
<dd><b>Tabular text format for received text</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Terminal can be set up to recognize incoming text as a table and format it accordingly; HyperTerminal can&#146;t.
<dd><b>Some advanced communications settings</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of the settings available in Terminal have been dropped in HyperTerminal. These include Carrier Detect, Flow Control for text files, Word Wrap for outgoing text files, and the ability to set the number of columns in the window. While these aren&#146;t often necessary, they do come in handy from time to time.
</DL>
<p>If you do plan to switch to HyperTerminal, you can make the transition as efficient as possible by importing the settings from your Terminal setup (<tt>.trm</TT>) files. To open a Terminal setup file</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose File <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-02i.jpg"> Open.<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bottom of the Select Session File dialog box, choose Terminal files from the list in the Files of Type box.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Locate the Terminal file you want, select it, and click Open. HyperTerminal reads its settings.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Make any necessary adjustments to the settings via the Properties dialog boxes.
<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose File <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-03i.jpg"> Save As to save the settings as a HyperTerminal connection (session file).</DL>
<p>After you&#146;ve completed these steps, you can use the new settings just as you would any other HyperTerminal connection.
