<p><font size="+1"><b>The Advanced Tab</B></FONT></P>
<p>On the Advanced Tab of the Connection Preferences dialog box, you will find the settings that control the terminal emulation and the hardware settings. In this section you will learn about the specific settings contained on the Advanced tab, as shown in Figure 15.7.

<p><b>Terminal Window</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Terminal Window area of the Advanced tab determines when the terminal window will be displayed during a HyperTerminal session. This area of the Advanced tab has two possible settings:</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Bring Up Terminal Window Before Dialing</B>
<dd>This check box tells HyperTerminal to open a terminal window prior to dialing the phone number listed in the connection. You can use this window to enter special commands to dial the modem.
<dt><b>Bring Up Terminal Window After Dialing</B>
<dd>Checking this box tells HyperTerminal to open a terminal window after dialing. This is useful for entering commands to log on to the remote service.
</DL>

<p><b>Hardware Settings</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Four key settings pertain to the way the two modems in a connection define and detect individual chunks of data. The two modems must agree on the same format for data; otherwise, they will speak completely different languages.</P>
<p>The individual data-format settings&#151;Data Bits, Parity-, Stop Bits, and Modulation&#151;are described in separate paragraphs below. To change any of these settings:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Display the Properties dialog box for the connection you&#146;re working with (see Figure 15.5).
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the list box labeled Connect Using, choose the modem you want to use for the connection, then click the Configure button. In the Preferences dialog box for this connection (see Figure 15.6) click the Advanced tab. The dialog box should now display the page shown in Figure 15.7.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;For each of the four settings in the Hardware Settings area, select the choice you want from the list.
<dl>
<br>
<dd><b>Data Bits</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Data Bits setting refers to the number of <i>bits</I> (the smallest division of computer information) you want to send in each chunk of data. For example, each letter is typically stored in your computer as 8 bits (8 bits is called a <i>byte</I>). This setting is almost always going to be 8; it must be 8 if you are intending to transfer binary files between computers. Binary files include all programs and any documents that consist of more than plain ASCII characters. Thus, formatted word processing documents, spreadsheets, and graphics documents are binary files. The other popular standard is 7 bits, which enables you to send plain text files slightly faster. The 4-, 5-, and 6-bit options are rarely used. Change this setting only if you are specifically told that the other system uses a setting other than 8 bits.
<dd><b>Parity</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Parity</I> is a means by which the communications software can perform a rudimentary check to see if an error has occurred in the transmission of each byte of data. Parity checking isn&#146;t commonly used, and the standard setting is None. If you are specifically told that the system with which you&#146;re communicating uses parity checking, change this setting to match.
<dd><b>Stop Bits</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop bits are used by the computers on both ends to indicate the end of one character and the beginning of the next. You can probably leave this set to 1. Change this setting if you are specifically told that the other system uses 2 or 1.5 stop bits.
<dd><b>Modulation</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This setting will normally work fine at the default of Standard. Modulation refers to the modulation signals with which the modems will communicate. Standard is the most common and will work for most modems. If your modem doesn&#146;t work well with this setting, consider changing to either Non-Standard (Bell, HST), or V.32 (Minitel). Check your modem&#146;s documentation for more information on its supported modulation types.

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading10"></A><font color="#000077">Choosing Terminal Settings</FONT></H4>
<p>Before PCs were invented, people used <i>terminals</I> to communicate with large mainframe computers. Terminals are essentially nothing but a screen and keyboard with which data can be entered and displayed. Unlike your PC, they have no internal computing power or disk storage. Because more than one manufacturer made terminals, conflicting standards developed regarding how data would be displayed on the terminal screens and how keyboards worked.</P>
<p>These standards remain valid today. They apply to communications setups using PCs as well as to terminals. As its name implies, HyperTerminal can make your PC act like an old-style terminal. But because your computer has more brains and storage capabilities than a terminal, your PC is something of a chameleon&#151;it can <i>emulate</I> more than one type of terminal with a change of options in a dialog box.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Some of the settings on the Settings page have more to do with personal taste than with ensuring successful communications. Still, because HyperTerminal lumps them together, we cover them in this section.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>For successful telecommunications, two computer systems must use the same terminal standard. This almost always means that you&#146;ll be setting up your connection to match the terminal standard used by the remote system.
</P>
<p>To set or check the settings pertaining to terminal emulation and related attributes in HyperTerminal, begin by choosing File <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-12i.jpg"> Properties or clicking the Properties button on the toolbar. In the Properties dialog box for this connection, click the Settings tab to display the page shown in Figure 15.8.</P>
