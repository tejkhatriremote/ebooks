<h3><a name="Heading30"></A><font color="#000077">Troubleshooting</FONT></H3>
<p>Despite great strides in the field of communications, mostly thanks to conveniences spurred by the personal computer market, communications is still a bit of a black art. Chances are good that you&#146;ll run into some problem or other while transferring files, sending mail, or whatever it is you end up doing with HyperTerminal. The fault will not necessarily lie with HyperTerminal (or yourself), but much more likely will be the result of improper wiring, faulty modems, noisy telephone lines, incorrect logon procedures, or incompatible software on the other end of the line. If you&#146;re trying to connect to a BBS or information service, don&#146;t hesitate to call them (the old-fashioned way) for help with making things work right. You can also get help from your company&#146;s computer expert, your computer store, or an experienced friend.
</P>
<p>In addition, here are some broad categories of problems and some brief tips on how to track down the solutions:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you receive a message that no lines are available, or if the Connect window never displays the Dialing message, something is wrong with your modem or its connection to your computer. The modem may not be connected properly, it may not be turned on, or the COM port settings may be incorrect. Your modem could even be broken, though this is by far the least likely problem.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If HyperTerminal is able to dial your modem but can&#146;t establish a connection, it eventually gives up. You&#146;ll see the message &#147;Busy&#148; in the Connect window. Typical reasons for failure at this point are the following:
<dl>
<br>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a busy signal.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The call didn&#146;t go through. Check to be sure that the phone number is correct. And check that you&#146;ve set up the Dialing Properties dialog box to dial the proper numbers to connect you to an outside line and to dial using your calling card, if you&#146;re using one.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The other phone never answered.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The other phone was answered but not by a modem (you dialed a voice line or a standard fax machine, or the other modem was turned off). You may have entered the wrong number or area code.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The modems are set at different speeds so they didn&#146;t recognize each other.
</DL>
<br>
</DL>
<p>When any of these problems occur, the Connect window remains on your screen. The Dial Now button becomes active, so if you want to try again, just click it.
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If a connection is made but you see gibberish on your screen, your modem settings don&#146;t match those of the other party. See &#147;Choosing Communications Settings&#148; for details on changing modem settings.
</DL>
<h3><a name="Heading31"></A><font color="#000077">Summary</FONT></H3>
<p>In this chapter, we discussed how to use HyperTerminal to dial and connect to various types of servers, from Bulletin Board Systems to Internet Service Providers. We went on to discover how to configure communications settings that affect HyperTerminal&#146;s capabilities, ranging from modem settings to terminal emulation modes. We learned how to transfer files and text information, and how the various settings affect the transmission. We closed the chapter by talking about basic troubleshooting of your modem connections.
