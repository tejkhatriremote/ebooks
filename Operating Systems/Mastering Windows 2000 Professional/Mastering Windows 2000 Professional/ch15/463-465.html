<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading21"></A><font color="#000077">Sending and Receiving Documents and Other Files</FONT></H4>
<p>Most of the files stored on your computer&#146;s disks do <i>not</I> consist of only text. Instead of simple sequences of characters arranged in lines, the typical file&#151;whether it&#146;s a document created by your word processing or spreadsheet program or the program itself&#151;contains all sorts of information in encoded form. This information is perfectly understandable by your computer (with the right software), but it usually looks like complete gibberish to you and me.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>There is a way, requiring a little legwork, to send non-text files to another person through an electronic-mail service that accepts only text-only files. You have to use a utility program that converts binary files into a special type of encoded 7-bit &#147;text&#148; file before sending it. The receiving party then has to reconvert the file on their end with the same utility program. Such utilities are available as shareware on many BBSs.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>That&#146;s why you can&#146;t transfer most files with HyperTerminal&#146;s Capture Text and Send Text File commands. You need the Send File and Receive File commands instead. These commands transfer the entire document just as it is, without trying to interpret it as text. In the bargain, they detect and correct errors that have crept in during the transfer.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>By the way, it&#146;s perfectly OK to send and receive text-only files via the Send File and Receive File commands to get the benefits of error correction. The only drawbacks: You won&#146;t see the text on your screen, and the process takes a tad longer.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>It&#146;s not uncommon for data to be lost or corrupted during the transmission process over telephone lines, particularly when long distances are involved. As we all know, long-distance lines often suffer from noise, static, or even other people&#146;s conversations accidentally being crossed with ours. Usually we just put up with the noise, asking the other party to repeat their last sentence, or we redial the call.
</P>
<p>Computers are less tolerant of such maladies. Noise on the line between two computers can cause a plethora of erratic data alterations during a file transfer. In response to this, computer scientists have devised numerous error-detection and error-correction schemes to determine whether errors have occurred in transmission and to correct them if possible. These schemes are referred to as <i>file-transfer protocols</I> because they also manage other aspects of the file-transfer process. HyperTerminal lets you choose from several of the most popular of these file-transfer protocols with its Receive File and Send File commands.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Understanding File-Transfer Protocols</B></FONT></P>
<p>To detect and correct errors, file-transfer protocols divide a file into a series of small sections, called <i>blocks.</I> The blocks are then sent sequentially and each one is accompanied by a mathematically calculated code based on the contents of the block. After getting the block, the receiving computer sees whether its contents match this calculated code. If they do, the sending computer is advised to send the next block. If there is a discrepancy, the receiving computer asks the sending computer to retransmit the block until it&#146;s received properly. This process continues until the entire file is transmitted error free.</P>
<p>Some file-transfer protocols, such as Zmodem, keep track of how far along the file transfer is from moment to moment. If the connection is broken, these protocols can pick up the file transfer where it left off so that you don&#146;t have to start all over again from scratch.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Choosing a File-Transfer Protocol</B></FONT></P>
<p>When you transfer a file with the Send File or Receive File commands, HyperTerminal lets you choose which of several file-transfer protocols to use. Although each of these protocols has its own characteristics, the critical point should sound familiar by now: To send or receive a file successfully, you need to use the same protocol as the other computer.
</P>
<p>Often, when you&#146;re transferring files to or from a commercial service or BBS, you&#146;ll be able to tell the other computer which protocol to use. Whether or not you select the other computer&#146;s protocol, just be sure to set HyperTerminal to match.</P>
<p>Here&#146;s a list of the file-transfer protocols available in HyperTerminal:</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Xmodem</B>
<dd>The first widely used error-detection and correction scheme. It was devised by Ward Christensen, who placed it in the public domain in 1977 for use on microcomputers, which were just then becoming available. Xmodem is available on most information services, such as CompuServe. The 1K version is a bit faster than the standard version.
<dt><b>Ymodem</B>
<dd>Similar to Xmodem but a little faster and more reliable.
<dt><b>Kermit</B>
<dd>May be the only protocol available when you communicate with some larger computers such as the minicomputers at a university. It&#146;s usually slower than the others, so this protocol should be a second or third choice.
<dt><b>Zmodem</B>
<dd>The fastest and most capable of HyperTerminal&#146;s protocols. Use this choice if the other computer permits it.
