<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading7"></A><font color="#000077">Repair the Problem</FONT></H4>
<p>This is the easy part&#151;usually. Finding the problem can often be a time-consuming process, but repairing the broken portion of the system can be as simple as replacing a corrupt file. Perhaps the issue arises from bad hardware. This is easy to fix; just replace the hardware. (The hard part here is to find the money for the replacement.)
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading8"></A><font color="#000077">Clean Up after Yourself</FONT></H4>
<p>Remember earlier how we said to test each possible solution individually? This is the phase where you undo some of the ideas that were unsuccessful. Never leave the system worse than you found it. There are few support issues worse than a customer who is upset that the previous support person made their problems worse or caused new ones.
</P>
<p>Again, it&#146;s helpful to have documented the approaches you tried&#151;especially if you kept notes about what you did during the troubleshooting phase. If you did, then it is simple to backtrack and turn features back on. When troubleshooting Windows 95, we would often rename the <tt>config.sys</TT> and <tt>autoexec.bat</TT> files to get them out of the way. Ever notice that your CD-ROM won&#146;t work if the driver doesn&#146;t load in the <tt>config.sys</TT>? Most customers will view this as a serious problem.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading9"></A><font color="#000077">Provide Closure</FONT></H4>
<p>If you are dealing with other people in your troubleshooting process, providing closure means informing them of what the problem was and what you did to resolve it. If you are going through this process to solve your own problem, it means reviewing what you did and understanding how to avoid this problem in the future.
</P>
<p>Nearly every person you work with when supporting an operating system will want to know what the problem was and how to fix it. We all like to feel that we have been included in finding a solution, that we are part of a team effort. A word of advice here: If you are supporting people on Windows 2000 as part of your job, always try to include the customer in the troubleshooting process. It helps them to feel better about the incident and about your presence. That, in turn, helps them to participate by giving you good information. And that makes everyone&#146;s day go better.</P>
<p>Now a moment for the darker side of support. If the problem was caused by the user&#146;s ignorance, getting closure is your opportunity to educate. If you do this with some sensitivity, you can turn this into a positive experience. If you give in to the temptation to tell the person that they&#146;re an idiot, you will be burning bridges that will be difficult to rebuild later. Your choice. If <i>you</I> are the customer, this is where you can ask advice or discover an opportunity for education.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading10"></A><font color="#000077">Troubleshooting Printing</FONT></H3>
<p>Printing is one of those areas that is most important to users of computer systems. Remember the promise of the &#147;paperless office&#148;? Anyone ever seen one? Printing is one of the highest causes of support calls, and one of the hardest areas to get good support in. This area in particular is one in which you need to think simple. Don&#146;t forget to ask yourself the easy questions, such as, &#147;Is it plugged in?&#148; and, &#147;Is it turned on?&#148; If they are answered up front, these two questions can save you a lot of time troubleshooting printing issues. Just remember to ask diplomatically when troubleshooting someone else&#146;s printing problem. No one likes to feel dumb.
</P>
<p>Let&#146;s work through a scenario to get a feel for how to apply the methodology to printing issues in Windows 2000. Here is your trouble ticket:</P>
<center>
<table width="90%"><tr>
<td width="30%">User:
<td width="70%">Bob
<tr>
<td>Telephone:
<td>12345
<tr>
<td>Problem:
<td>Can&#146;t print
<tr>
<td>Description:
<td>Nothing comes out when I try to print.
<tr>
<td>Priority:
<td>URGENT!
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<p>As you can see, your user Bob is having trouble trying to print a document and feels that it is urgent that this be resolved quickly. The first step is to define the problem, so you contact Bob at his cubicle. Bob informs you that the job he is trying to print is a monthly profit-and-loss report for The Boss. Sounds pretty important so you get right to work on the problem.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Scenario 1: Printer Is Unplugged</B></FONT></P>
<dl>
<dd><b>Simple questions first.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Has it ever worked? Bob tells you that the printer worked fine the last time he tried to print, which was yesterday. What happened when he tried to print this time? He clicked Print in Word 97 and got a message that the printer was offline or out of paper.
<dd><b>Test the approach.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You look at the print device, an HP LaserJet 5MP that is on Bob&#146;s desk, and see that the lights are on. This indicates that the printer is plugged in to electricity. Next, you try toggling the online/offline switch and find that the print device is online. Still thinking simple, you next check the back of Bob&#146;s print device to make sure the parallel cable is firmly attached. It is. Bob&#146;s computer is a tower and is located under his desk. You crawl under the desk to check the parallel cable and find that it has fallen off the back of the computer. You reconnect the cable and try to print a test page. It works!
<dd><b>Provide closure.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The closure comes with the determination that Bob may have accidentally kicked loose the cable when he stretched his feet out under his desk. One possible solution to avoid this is to be sure that the retaining clips of the parallel cable are correctly fastened on the computer&#146;s parallel port. Providing an explanation of the cause along with a solution gives the customer some closure on the issue.
</DL>
<p>This sounds ridiculously easy, right? You might be surprised to find out that this ticket, or a slight variation thereof, is a very common answer for help desks.
