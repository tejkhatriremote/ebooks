<p>The typical life of a KB article begins when an engineer hangs up the phone after fixing a new problem. &#147;Wow,&#148; he exclaims, &#147;that was the weirdest thing I&#146;ve seen yet.&#148; The engineer mentions the issue to his neighbor, who starts taking notes because <i>she&#146;s</I> never seen it either. Then the local KB Editor hears about it and starts pestering the engineer to write it up in an article. Now, not every engineer can or will write articles, but there is always someone looking to expand their writing career who will tackle the article if the engineer can explain it well enough. So one way or another the article gets written. Then it is edited for style and reviewed for technical accuracy. If it passes all the reviews, it is added to the Knowledge Base.</P>
<p>The support engineers at Microsoft use these articles to resolve issues for customers, and once in a while the engineers find an article that isn&#146;t quite accurate. They can then submit a comment to the editors describing the problem with the article so it can be fixed. On occasion the comments are helpful; sometimes they&#146;re just very emotional. The point is, these articles are constantly being reviewed and updated for accuracy.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Accessing the Knowledge Base</B></FONT></P>
<p>The Knowledge Base can be accessed in a few ways. The first is to call Microsoft Technical Support and let them do the browsing through the KB. This might be a better answer than you realize because they have access to articles that aren&#146;t released to the public. This isn&#146;t some dark Microsoft conspiracy; it&#146;s mostly out of consideration for other companies&#146; reputations (and their own). If a problem is serious but hasn&#146;t been fully documented by all parties involved, Microsoft isn&#146;t going to expose itself to possible litigation over a KB article. The information will be marked as MSONLY or PARTNER so that only support engineers can see the information. After all parties have confirmed the issues, the article can be released to the public.
</P>
<p>The easiest way for us mere mortals to use the Knowledge Base is to access it through the Support Online pages at Microsoft&#146;s Web site. This location is updated approximately twice a week to contain the latest information. If there is a hot issue that needs to be dealt with immediately (such as a bug in Internet Explorer&#146;s security), the fix is released overnight and an article is sent into the KB right away.</P>
<p>The third way is to use TechNet, which is a subscription-based product from Microsoft for Information Systems and support professionals. TechNet is sent out once a month on several CD-ROMs. The first CD-ROM contains the entire public Knowledge Base, additional white papers, Resource Kits, and training materials. The remaining CD-ROMs contain the entire Microsoft driver library; all the current Service Packs, patches, and device drivers that Microsoft provides for their operating systems; and other products.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Understanding the Art of Query</B></FONT></P>
<p>Finding information in the Knowledge Base can be difficult. Face it, this thing is <i>huge</I>. Microsoft support engineers spend time in training after they&#146;re hired just learning to use the KB effectively. Don&#146;t feel bad if you have trouble at first finding the information you want. We&#146;ve listed some helpful hints here that should make the task easier.</P>
<p>Start specific, and move outward. Try querying on a specific error message (if you have one). If that doesn&#146;t work, try a few words from the error and the names of the files or devices involved in the problem. For example, if you wanted to find an article about a blue-screen error and your Adaptec 2940 controller, you might submit this query:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>Winnt and adaptec and 2940 and STOP and 0x1E</B>
</DL>
<p>And if there were any issues related to a blue screen with the STOP code 0x1E dealing with an Adaptec 2940 controller, the list of articles would be displayed (there aren&#146;t any, in case you&#146;re wondering). Notice the <i>and</I> between each of the query words. When querying the KB using this structure, the results will be articles that contain <i>all</I> the words. You are literally asking for all articles containing the words <i>Winnt</I>, <i>Adaptec</I>, <i>2940</I>, <i>STOP</I>, and <i>0x1E</I>. Any article that has only some of the words will not be returned. The default action when you type a string of query words is to find any article that contains <i>at least one</I> of those words.</P>
<p>There is a way to increase the likelihood of success in querying the KB. If you include certain <i>keywords</I> in your search, you will find specific articles more easily. In Table 32.2 we have included some keywords that can help improve your KB query skills.</P>
