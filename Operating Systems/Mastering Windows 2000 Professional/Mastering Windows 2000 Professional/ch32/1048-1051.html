<h3><a name="Heading17"></A><font color="#000077">Troubleshooting Windows 2000 Networking</FONT></H3>
<p>Because Windows 2000 is a network operating system, it makes sense that you will probably encounter issues with your network from time to time. In most documentation you find today, the troubleshooting text tells you to perform &#147;standard network troubleshooting&#148; without ever telling you what that is. This section lets you in on that secret. Troubleshooting networking is one area in particular where our basic methodology will help you.
</P>
<p>First, you start with any error message that Windows 2000 gives you. This is always the first step in troubleshooting Windows 2000: Use whatever information it provides. Write the error message exactly as it appears because you can later use that to query the Knowledge Base. Next, you want to see what the Event Viewer can tell you. Event Viewer is probably the best friend you have in troubleshooting Windows 2000. It&#146;s not always clear and concise, but it will often tell you exactly what the problem is. It&#146;s always worth checking.</P>
<p>These things are true for any type of troubleshooting in Windows 2000. But basic network troubleshooting goes beyond Windows 2000&#146;s systems to encompass any network operating system. That&#146;s what we need to focus on in this section.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading18"></A><font color="#000077">Is It Plugged In?</FONT></H4>
<p>What do you need in order to have a conversation? You must have some kind of medium to carry the information from one person to another. You must also have some rules to determine how that conversation will take place. Imagine what happens when you meet someone on the street and strike up a conversation. You probably start by making eye contact, then smiling and speaking. If you both happen to speak at least one language in common, you can communicate easily. There may be a few failed attempts before you both find a language you can use, but eventually you will succeed.
</P>
<p>A network is just like that. In its simplest form, a network can be two computers connected by a wire. When one wants to talk to the other, the first computer needs some kind of attention signal; then they both need to negotiate a common language and follow the rules of that language to communicate.</P>
<p>Networks can be simple systems or they can be complex. But however complicated they get, they all have certain things in common. They all have something connecting the nodes, and they all have at least one language. On most networks, the nodes are individual computers as well as intermediary systems such as routers, bridges, switches, and gateways. The language of a network is the protocol.</P>
<p>When troubleshooting any network system, keep these fundamental concepts in mind. Start with the communications medium. Is a proper cable plugged into the computer? Is the other end of the cable plugged into a hub or wall drop? If you are using coax cable, do you have a T-connector and possibly a terminator? Are the drivers for the network card installed and working? Do you have at least one protocol in common with the other computer?</P>
<p>These sound like simple questions, and they are really. You might be surprised how often these simple questions will resolve your networking issues.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading19"></A><font color="#000077">Is Anybody Out There?</FONT></H4>
<p>Most of the troubleshooting we&#146;ve talked about so far has dealt with working on one computer at a time. Network troubleshooting often involves the connecting systems between the computers as much or more than the computers themselves. We&#146;ve shown you many ways to work with problems on computers, but how do you see what&#146;s wrong with a whole network? That&#146;s what this section is about. Here we introduce you to some of the tools included in Windows 2000 to troubleshoot the network.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Troubleshooting TCP/IP</B></FONT></P>
<p>The single most common network protocol today is TCP/IP. Its popularity is most likely due to the Internet, but also because TCP/IP is an industry standard suite of protocols. It is not just one protocol, but rather a group of them designed to perform specific tasks. The part that most people like is the industry standard part. That means that if you have Macs and NetWare and Unix computers on your network, your Windows 2000 Professional computer can easily communicate with all of them using TCP/IP. TCP/IP is also popular with support people because it has so many troubleshooting tools built in.
</P>
<p><b>Ping</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Packet Inter-Network Groper (Ping) is the most basic test of network communication over TCP/IP. What Ping does for you is bounce a series of packets off of a remote host. You&#146;re essentially just saying &#147;Hello?&#148; over and over and (hopefully) getting a response each time. The basic syntax is <tt>ping www.host.com</TT> or <tt>ping 10.1.0.44</TT>.</P>
<p>So what does this tell you? Getting a response when pinging by IP address means that your network card is installed correctly, the driver is working, the TCP/IP protocol is working, Windows Sockets is working, the other computer is working, and everything in between is working. That&#146;s quite a lot of information for just one small command! When you ping by host name, you get all the previous information, plus you know that your hostname resolution is working.</P>
<p>You can also ping the address 127.0.0.1. This address is reserved for the local host (the local computer) and is a loop-back diagnostic test of your installed TCP/IP software. Successfully pinging the local host verifies that TCP/IP is successfully installed on the local computer.</P>
<p><b>Hostname</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The hostname utility returns the hostname of the local computer. This can be helpful when you aren&#146;t exactly sure what it is.</P>
<p><b>IPConfig</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;IPConfig is right up there with ping when it comes to valuable TCP/IP utilities. This tool enables you to view some or all of your TCP/IP configuration (as the name might imply). To use it, type <tt>ipconfig</TT> at the command prompt to receive your IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway. If you type <tt>ipconfig/all</TT>, you will see a listing of every TCP/IP configuration for every interface on your computer. To give you some idea of the scope of information, Figure 32.1 shows the output of the <tt>ipconfig/all</TT> command.</P>

</P>
<p>IPConfig can also be used to release and renew IP addresses acquired through DHCP. The process for this is <tt>ipconfig/release</TT> then <tt>ipconfig/renew</TT>.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Windows 95 and Windows 98 have a utility called <tt>winipcfg.exe</TT> that provides the same functionality as <tt>ipconfig</TT> in a GUI interface. <tt>winipcfg.exe</TT> is available for Windows 2000 in the Windows 2000 Resource Kit.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><b>ARP</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The ARP command views and modifies the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache. ARP is used by TCP/IP to resolve an IP address such as 10.1.0.1 to a unique hardware address or MAC address.</P><p><br></P>
