<p><font size="+1"><b>Troubleshooting IPX/SPX</B></FONT></P>
<p>IPX/SPX used to be the protocol of choice on Novell networks and it still is in many. It&#146;s a fine, routable protocol, relatively fast and easy to configure. So why is it being mentioned in a troubleshooting section? Because there are settings that are frequently misconfigured. The problems with the IPX/SPX protocol stem from those options for configuration that must be set correctly for two computers to hold a conversation. Most notable is the setting for frame type.
</P>
<p><i>Frame type</I> refers to the manner in which data is packaged when placed on the physical wire. It describes the header and addressing fields, the error correction, and the overall size of the data that can be sent at one time. IPX/SPX supports five frame types: 802.2, 802.3, Ethernet II, Ethernet SNAP, and Token Ring. The most common are 802.2 and 802.3. Windows 2000 Professional (like most operating systems) uses only one frame type at a time. Windows 2000 Server, on the other hand, can use up to all five at once. Frame types are important because you must have the same frame type as the computer you are trying to communicate with. Mismatched frame types are probably the most common reason for failed communication over IPX/SPX.</P>
<p>In Microsoft networking, NWLink is called the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol even though it is fully compliant with all IPX/SPX standards. It is different only in that it provides a NetBIOS layer to facilitate name services on Microsoft network operating systems. For troubleshooting, that may or may not be important to know. What is important to know is that it is fully compliant with everyone else&#146;s IPX/SPX protocol.</P>
<p>Unlike TCP/IP in Windows 2000, NWLink doesn&#146;t ship with a bunch of troubleshooting utilities. That&#146;s usually not a problem because most issues will be resolved in the configuration. The primary tool for checking your NWLink configuration will be either the Network applet in Control Panel or <tt>ipxroute.exe</TT>. Using <tt>ipxroute.exe</TT> enables you to view the current configuration of NWLink for each network adapter in the computer and to modify the IPX/SPX routing table if the computer has more than one network interface. Entering the command <tt>ipxroute config</TT> at the command prompt will display the current configuration of NWLink.</P>
<p>Figure 32.3 shows the properties sheet for NWLink on Windows 2000 Professional. The properties on Windows 2000 Server are a bit different, so you may find this a little confusing if you are more familiar with Windows 2000 Server. The essentials are covered here&#151;the adapter, the frame type, and the network number. The default setting for the frame type is Auto Detect. Microsoft tells us that this setting enables Windows 2000 to scan the frame types being transmitted across the wire and then pick the most prevalent type. In fact, what appears to happen is that Windows 2000 uses the very first frame type it comes across. Usually this will be correct. But on a network that utilizes multiple frame types, your Windows 2000 computer may choose the wrong frame type when it starts up, causing you to be cut off from the servers you need.</P>

<p>The other important setting on this page is the network number. IPX/SPX handles routing of information by using these network numbers to identify each unique section of a network. Every segment (the section of network between two routers) must be assigned a unique network number. The default setting in Windows 2000 takes care of that for you. When you are using Auto Detect for the frame type, it will also detect the local network number. If you change from Auto Detect to a specific frame type, you will need to enter a valid network number. Contact your network administrator if necessary.
</P>
<p>If you need more information than these tools provide, you will need to resort to a network analyzer such as Microsoft&#146;s Network Monitor, which is included with their Systems Management Server (SMS) package.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Troubleshooting NetBEUI</B></FONT></P>
<p>Network issues regarding the NetBEUI protocol usually involve name resolution and NetBIOS. NetBEUI is a great protocol for the right environment&#151;typically a small network consisting of 50 or fewer computers. It&#146;s a good choice if you will never need to route data from one network to another, and if you will not be connecting directly to the Internet.
</P>
<p>NetBEUI is self-tuning and self-optimizing. It&#146;s truly a protocol that you can install and it &#147;just works.&#148; The biggest troubleshooting issue you are likely to see is when browsing. Browsing through Network Neighborhood is something that nearly all users do, and it&#146;s almost always what they mean when they say, &#147;I can&#146;t see the server.&#148; For a full description of browsing on Windows 2000, please see Chapter 24, &#147;Essentials of Windows 2000 Networking.&#148;</P>
<p>If you need to resolve something deeper than browsing issues, you will need a network analyzer because NetBEUI doesn&#146;t provide any built-in tools for troubleshooting.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading20"></A><font color="#000077">How Do You Troubleshoot Windows 2000 Network Architecture?</FONT></H4>
<p>Although it&#146;s true that a good troubleshooting method can work you through almost any problem, at times you need to know more. In fact, we believe that the more you know about how something&#146;s put together, the easier it is to find what&#146;s wrong. That&#146;s certainly true of a complex system such as Windows 2000.
</P>
<p>At the beginning of this chapter, we noted that troubleshooting is the process of going from a big picture view of things to a small detail view. Questions are the primary tool for accomplishing this, but knowledge is also a valuable tool. Figure 32.4 shows the overall network architecture of Windows 2000.</P>

<p><font size="+1"><b>User Mode Components</B></FONT></P>
<p>The following are components of the User mode.
</P>
<p><b>Application Layer</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Application layer is where your program is accepting your network requests. For example, when you type in the URL of your favorite Web site, you are interacting with the Application layer.</P>
<p><b>Multiple Provider Router</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Multiple Provider Router (MPR) is kind of like a traffic cop in that its job is to direct the flow of communication. Windows 2000 uses the MPR only when you are mapping a network drive. Its task is to decide which of the installed network clients will do the best job in making the drive mapping.</P><p><br></P>
