<p><big><big>E</BIG></BIG>ver have one of <i>those</I> days? A day when nothing seems to go right with your computer? Unfortunately, an operating system like Windows 2000 is extremely complex, and any complex system will inevitably have those days. Just remember this quote from a favorite Scottish engineer: &#147;The more they over-tink the plumbing, the easier it is to stop up the drains.&#148; With a system like Windows 2000 Professional, there are so many places where things can go wrong, it&#146;s often difficult to find a place to start.</P>
<p>In this chapter, we take a look at the &#147;how&#148; of troubleshooting Windows 2000 Professional. Much of what we cover here will be equally useful on Windows 2000 Server, but the main focus is of course, Professional. We want to give you a workable method for finding your way through the maze.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">The Tao of Troubleshooting</FONT></H3>
<p>At first it seems that troubleshooting mostly involves memorizing a lot of details about everything. When working with an experienced troubleshooter you&#146;ve probably even found yourself thinking, &#147;How do they know that?&#148; Truth is, most people never do well by simply trying to memorize everything. Human beings succeed best when working from their strengths; we all have problems when working from our weaknesses. To make troubleshooting a strength, you need to find the pattern in the chaos.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The process of troubleshooting is the process of moving from &#147;Big Picture&#148; to small detail. Asking questions is the tool for breaking the big picture into small details.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Consider this scenario: A friend tells you that he is having trouble getting a vending machine to accept a dollar bill. If you happen to be a vending machine expert, you might know everything about how the dollar bill is drawn into the machine: every detail of the mechanisms that control the entire process. Probably not. Instead, being a good troubleshooter, you consider the directions on the machine. Then you start asking questions.
</P>
<blockquote><p>&#147;Has it ever worked before?&#148;
</P>
<p>&#147;Did you put the dollar in facing the right direction?&#148;</P>
<p>&#147;Is the dollar bill folded?&#148;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE><p>With this question your friend admits that the corners of the bill are a bit folded. So you try straightening them out. Then you test your solution by reinserting the bill. It works and you are a hero. Of course, solving a problem like this has a low glory quotient, but it serves to illustrate the basics.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">Define the Problem: &#147;It&#146;s Broken.&#148;</FONT></H4>
<p>The first step to successful troubleshooting is to accurately define the problem. Many times people will define a problem in very simple terms and expect you to know what they are talking about. Your job as a troubleshooter is to define the details of the problem: &#147;So what <i>exactly</I> is broken?&#148; This is a good question to start the conversation. (Incidentally, this may be a conversation with yourself if you are trying to solve your own problem.) Start by getting a clear description of what the customer&#151;the person who is reporting the problem&#151;feels is the issue. It is often a good technique to take the time to write these points out on paper.</P>
<p>Try to get all the details that describe the problem as the customer sees it. Ask questions like &#147;Has it ever worked before?&#148; or &#147;When did you notice that it stopped working?&#148;</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading4"></A><font color="#000077">Explore the Boundaries</FONT></H4>
<p>This can be a painful lesson to learn. Often the person you are working with to solve a problem (yes, this can even be yourself) leaves out important details. This is almost never because they want you to fail, but rather because they don&#146;t think that a particular detail is relevant. This is a painful lesson because you may spend a great deal of time pursuing irrelevant issues when the real problem is very simple. Consider the following illustration.
</P>
<p>You are talking with a customer about their computer problem. The issue, as reported, is that the new internal modem isn&#146;t working. So right away you dig in to the settings and configuration for the modem. You try initialization strings, but the operating system cannot even detect the modem. About 30 minutes go by and you&#146;re no closer to a solution. You ask the customer to double-click something in Control Panel and he replies, &#147;I can&#146;t do that.&#148; When you ask why, you are told that the mouse doesn&#146;t work either. Slapping your forehead, you know the answer: The modem is installed on IRQ 4, and so is the mouse.</P>
<p>Exploring the boundaries means finding out everything that may be wrong with the system. The proper question here is: &#147;Is there anything else that doesn&#146;t appear to be working?&#148; If you had asked this question in the preceding scenario, you could have solved the problem in about 10 minutes instead of 40 minutes. The extra information you get here <i>may</I> be unrelated to the problem, but it may be exactly the piece you need to solve the puzzle.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading5"></A><font color="#000077">Brainstorm and Document</FONT></H4>
<p>Now that you have a clue about where the problem lies, it&#146;s time to come up with some ideas to help focus in on the real issue. While you are gathering your thoughts, write them down. Try to have at least three things to try before proceeding.
</P>
<p>Writing down your ideas is important. You will be trying each possible approach, and this may take time. It may be difficult to remember each idea when you&#146;re in the heat of battle (figuratively speaking). Don&#146;t be afraid to add to this list as you go. Often you will discover the best approach while trying one of your initial ideas.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading6"></A><font color="#000077">Test Your Ideas</FONT></H4>
<p>This is a critical point: Test each approach&#151;one at a time.
</P>
<p>It is impossible to overemphasize this point. Many troubleshooters will try the &#147;shotgun&#148; approach, meaning that they test every idea they can muster all at once. Most likely one of the ideas will work, but which one?</P>
<p>During the course of troubleshooting an operating system, you will frequently be disabling certain functionalities. If you try every idea at the same time, you may fix the problem but you&#146;ll be left with an operating system that has been crippled by your actions. Worse yet, you won&#146;t know which areas to re-enable and which one to repair.</P>
<p>Testing each idea one at a time enables you to discover clearly what&#146;s broken and to easily find your way back through the maze of settings that have been changed.</P><p><br></P>
