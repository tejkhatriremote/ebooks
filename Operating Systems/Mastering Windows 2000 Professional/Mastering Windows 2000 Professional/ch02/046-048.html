<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading19"></A><font color="#000077">Running Programs Minimized</FONT></H4>
<p>Every program on your hard drive can be set to run minimized. When you minimize a program, you shrink the size of the program window so that it appears only as a button on your Taskbar. By setting the Run Minimized command in an application&#146;s Properties page, every time you start that program it automatically runs minimized.
</P>
<p>Running a program in a minimized window can be helpful if you want to start a program that you know you will need to use, but not immediately. Or, if you start certain programs automatically, you can have them run in a minimized window and not clutter your Desktop right away.</P>
<p>To set an application to run minimized, select its icon, right-click it, and choose Properties. Click the box labeled Run Minimized and click OK. You can also select Properties from Explorer&#146;s File menu, or you can simultaneously press the Ctrl and the Enter key on your keyboard.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading20"></A><font color="#000077">Special Topic: Running DOS Applications</FONT></H4>
<p>There are two ways to run DOS applications under Windows 2000. You may ask, &#147;Why would I want to bother with DOS, anyway?&#148; Well, it&#146;s not always a question of wanting to; sometimes it&#146;s a question of needing to run DOS. There is a tremendous installed base of DOS software, and you never know when you might have to run some of it in order to finish a project started by someone else or to look at something historical in its original application. (Or maybe you just can&#146;t get enough of your favorite DOS games. That&#146;s a necessity, right?) Windows 2000 provides not one, but two, ways to run DOS applications.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>You don&#146;t need to have DOS installed on your system to run a DOS application under Windows 2000.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The easiest way to run a DOS program is to run it the same way you would run a Windows program: Locate the DOS program by using Explorer, and then double-click its icon to launch it. No problem.
</P>
<p>Many computer users are also comfortable using the command prompt (sometimes called the DOS prompt, even though in Windows 2000 it isn&#146;t DOS) to give instructions to their computer, including instructions to run programs. In some cases, using the command prompt is faster because you avoid the overhead used by the Windows graphical user interface (GUI).</P>
<p>To use the command prompt to run a DOS program, click the Start menu; then, on the Programs submenu, click Command Prompt. This will open a window that looks remarkably like DOS. This is actually the 32-bit command line interface of Windows 2000. From this prompt you can type the path and name of the DOS program you want to run, for example, <tt>C:\wp5\wp51</TT>, to run WordPerfect version 5.1.</P>
<p>When you use the command prompt, most of the old DOS commands you may remember will work. The exceptions, as mentioned previously, are any commands that try to access hardware directly, as outlined below:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can&#146;t use <tt>SCANDISK</TT> (formerly used to check hard disk errors). Instead, use the error-checking tool available through the drive&#146;s properties sheet to check for disk errors or run <tt>CHKDSK/F</TT> from the command prompt.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can&#146;t use <tt>DEFRAG</TT> (formerly used to defragment your hard disk). Instead, use the new Disk Defragmenter that is located in the System Tools folder on the Start menu.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can&#146;t use <tt>LOCK</TT> (formerly used to reserve direct access to the hard drive). Instead, you can use Windows 2000&#146;s workstation administration features to grant and verify rights to specific users and objects.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can&#146;t use any DOS commands that compromise security.

<h3><a name="Heading21"></A><font color="#000077">Switching from One Window to Another</FONT></H3>
<p>Windows 2000 provides some easy ways to go back and forth between your open windows and applications.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading22"></A><font color="#000077">Using Alt+Tab to Switch</FONT></H4>
<p>The keyboard approach to switching from one task to another is the Alt&#43;Tab key combination. When you press these two keys together, a dialog box opens, showing icons and names for each of the items you have open. (Actually, this was available in earlier versions of Windows as well, but from many reports the technique wasn&#146;t well known.) Hold down the Alt key while repeatedly pressing the Tab key to highlight each icon in a cycle. When the item you want to go to is highlighted, release the Alt&#43;Tab keys to go to that item&#146;s window.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading23"></A><font color="#000077">Using the Taskbar to Switch</FONT></H4>
<p>One of the biggest criticisms Microsoft received regarding the Program Manager approach to Windows computing was that you couldn&#146;t tell at a glance which programs you were running at any given time. Their solution to this problem is the Taskbar. Everything you have opened, including windows for folders and drives, is listed on the Taskbar.
</P>
<p>The Taskbar isn&#146;t just for display, however. Each smaller bar you see on the Taskbar (shown in the following graphic) acts as a button. You can click the button to move the Desktop&#146;s focus to the item it represents, thus bringing its window to the front if it has been obscured, or maximizing it if it has been minimized.</P>
