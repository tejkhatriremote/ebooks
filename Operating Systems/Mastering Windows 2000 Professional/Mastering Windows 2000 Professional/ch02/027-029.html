<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading6"></A><font color="#000077">Desktop Replacements</FONT></H4>
<p>In earlier versions of Windows, you could easily replace the default shell by adding on a third-party replacement. A shell is the user interface of the operating system. In other words, the part you actually interact with. In Windows 3.<i>x</I> and Windows NT 3.<i>x</I>, the shell was a program called Program Manager (<tt>progman.exe</TT>). This shell could be easily replaced by installing one of the numerous replacement shells. There aren&#146;t any shell replacements for Windows 2000 at this time, but have no doubt that there will be some in the future.</P>
<p>The shell for Windows 95 and NT 4 was Explorer (<tt>explorer.exe</TT>). It introduced new features that made the operating system more intuitive and easier to use. We will discuss the features that carried over to Windows 2000 in greater depth later in this chapter, but to list a couple of them here, remember the Start menu and the Task Bar? You will still find those features in Windows 2000, but many of the others have either been replaced or at least updated with new functionality.</P>
<p>With the advent of Internet Explorer 4 (IE4) from Microsoft, there has been at least one modified shell available for Windows 95 or NT 4. When you installed this Internet browser, you could choose to replace the Explorer shell with Internet Explorer&#146;s Active Desktop. In Windows 2000, like Windows 98, Internet Explorer became integrated into the operating system. The difference between Windows 98 and Windows 2000 is more apparent in the more subtle approach to this integration.</P>

<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>When you consider the dominance of Windows in the world today, it makes sense to look seriously at the application support for the different flavors of Windows. DOS applications are no longer common, and the ones that are still in use belong mostly to vertical market without much call for new software. More and more software titles are being revised to bring them into the Win32 world. It&#146;s time to consider the benefits of 32-bit programs and upgrade any of your remaining 16-bit applications.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h3><a name="Heading7"></A><font color="#000077">Discovering Programs You Can&#146;t Run Anymore</FONT></H3>
<p>You probably didn&#146;t buy Windows 2000 just to play with its features. You bought this operating system to run your applications, right? With the possible exception of older DOS and some 16-bit Windows applications, you won&#146;t have many problems running your programs in Windows 2000. Keep in mind that some of these applications will suffer a slight performance hit when they are run in Windows 2000 and many DOS games won&#146;t run at all. Just like earlier versions of Windows NT, Windows 2000 will need to do some extra work when it runs older programs. These older applications often try to talk directly to the hardware, and Windows 2000 can&#146;t permit this and still maintain its security and stability.
</P>
<p>Windows 2000 will run all of your 32-bit Windows programs, and most of your older DOS and Windows applications. DOS utilities probably won&#146;t run because they usually try to access the hardware directly in ways that Windows 2000 can&#146;t intercept safely. If the program runs in protected mode and lets Windows 2000 handle the hardware access, then everyone will be happy, and the program will run correctly. If they try to go past the operating system to the hardware and Windows 2000 can&#146;t handle the access with a VxD, then Windows 2000 will shut down the application. This means that you won&#146;t be able to run DOS TSRs, such as CD-ROM drivers or memory managers.</P>
<p>To be blunt, every program and every file you run under Windows 2000 must operate in protected mode. All 32-bit programs run in this mode; not all 16-bit programs do. We&#146;ll discuss the difference between these two modes later in this section, in a sidebar titled &#147;What Are the Differences between 16-Bit and 32-Bit Programs?&#148; To put it another way, the program cannot access the computer&#146;s hardware directly. Windows 2000 will shut down any program that tries to directly access the hardware. If the program uses the operating system&#146;s services to run, everybody&#146;s happy.</P>
<p>A brief additional word about games: You can run most <i>Windows</I> games under Windows 2000, but some will run noticeably more slowly, as discussed in the next section. Any <i>DOS</I> game that creates its own <i>virtual environment</I> will also probably run, albeit slowly, and those that don&#146;t, won&#146;t. However, new 32-bit, protected-mode games are appearing almost faster than your local computer store can keep track, so you&#146;re sure to find plenty of titles that will run on Windows 2000. Many of the most popular games today will run fine on Windows 2000; in fact, some will actually run better than they did on Windows 98. The best bet is to check the manufacturer&#146;s recommendations to see if they support Windows NT or Windows 2000. You&#146;ll likely notice better support for these applications in Windows 2000 than in previous versions of Windows NT since Windows 2000 has added Plug-and-Play support and uses the common driver model (meaning it uses the same drivers as Windows 98).</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading8"></A><font color="#000077">Some DOS and Win 3.<i>x</I> Apps Run Slowly
</FONT></H4>
<p>Because the programs written for DOS or 16-bit Windows often use direct hardware access, Windows 2000 will have to watch them more closely. The result of this is that these applications may run more slowly in Windows 2000 than in the environment they were written for. If they are written to use standard hardware-access schemes, or what Windows developers would call &#147;clean,&#148; then Windows 2000 will run them without any problems and virtually as fast as they would run in Windows 3.<i>x</I> or DOS. The problem is that you won&#146;t know which ones will run properly until you try them out on your system.</P>
<p>Windows 2000 has included in it new virtual devices drivers that should allow nearly all current software to run properly.</P><p><br></P>
