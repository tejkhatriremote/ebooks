<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading16"></A><font color="#000077">Running Programs by Accessing the Files They Create</FONT></H4>
<p>You don&#146;t necessarily need to <i>find</I> a program to launch it. You can also start a program by opening a file or document that has been <i>associated</I> with that program. For example, if you want to launch Microsoft Word, you can double-click a Word document in Explorer or in the Search utility&#146;s Results window. This opens Microsoft Word and also loads the file you double-clicked.</P>
<p>If you already have a program running that has been associated with the types of documents it creates, you have even more methods of opening its associated documents. From Explorer or from the list resulting from a Search operation, you can do whichever of the following seems most convenient:</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Double-click the document icon</B>
<dd>Opens the document.
<dt><b>Drag the document&#146;s icon to the program&#146;s menu bar</B>
<dd>Opens the document in its own document window within the program.
<dt><b>Drag the document&#146;s icon into the program&#146;s workspace</B>
<dd>Inserts the document into the currently open document. (Unlike the second approach, this action doesn&#146;t simply open it into its own document window.)
</DL>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>There&#146;s even a fourth technique for opening a file from Explorer or a Search list. If you have a program active on the Taskbar but it&#146;s not currently visible on the Desktop (perhaps it&#146;s hidden behind Explorer itself), you can drag the document icon to the program&#146;s button on the Taskbar and, without unclicking, hold it over that button until the program reappears on the Desktop. At that point, you can continue dragging the icon as you would using the second or third method above. (That is, drag to the menu bar to open the document, or drag to the program&#146;s workspace to insert it into the currently open document.)<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading17"></A><font color="#000077">Special Topic: Running Programs with Shortcuts</FONT></H4>
<p>The history of humanity has been spent searching for faster, easier ways to do things. That&#146;s why we have microwave ovens, drive-through windows, and <i>shortcuts</I>. In Windows 2000, you can make a shortcut to any object that exists in the operating system&#151;files, folders, programs, hard drives, and other computers on the network. Anything. You can even make shortcuts to other shortcuts!</P>
<p>The shortcut appears as an icon that you can click to open the associated file or resource. Because you can put a shortcut anywhere on the Desktop, or anywhere in an Explorer or Explorer-type list, the shortcut can save you a lot of browsing to find your favorite items. Taking a mere 1K of drive space on average, a shortcut is an economical way to set up quick access to your programs.</P>
<p>To create a shortcut from within an Explorer or Explorer-type list, do one of the following:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-click the object you want to create a shortcut to, and drag the object to the Desktop or to the folder or drive of your choice. When you let go of the mouse button, a menu pops up with various choices. Choose the option that says Create Shortcut(s) Here. The item (file, folder, resource, whatever) remains in its original location; the shortcut appears where you dragged it.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy the item you want to create a shortcut to, then select the folder in which you want the shortcut to appear, and choose Paste Shortcut from the Edit menu.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select an object and choose Create Shortcut from the File menu, then drag or copy the shortcut thus created to the Desktop, or to the folder or drive of your choice.
</DL>
<p>Anything you can do to a file you can do to a shortcut. If you send a shortcut via e-mail to another MS Exchange Mail user, the shortcut will appear as an active shortcut in the e-mail message. The recipient will be able to double-click the shortcut and access the original file, or they will copy the shortcut to their Desktop or anywhere else in their computer. This is a great way to distribute information across a network!
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading18"></A><font color="#000077">Running Programs by Using Run</FONT></H4>
<p>You can also use the Start menu&#146;s Run command for launching applications. This works just like the Run command in Windows 98 or NT 4. When you choose Run, you&#146;ll see a dialog box like the following:
</P>
<p><a name="Fig10"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch02/images/02-10.jpg',347,179)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch02/images/02-10t.jpg"></A></P>
<p>If you&#146;re like most end users, you don&#146;t know or care where your application files are living on your hard drive, and you might not notice how they&#146;re spelled. For you, the Browse&#133; button was invented.Click the Browse button within the Run dialog box, and a mini-Explorer opens to enable you to search for the program you want, just as if you were searching for anything else on your hard drive. (The mini-Explorer is shown on the facing page.) After you find the file, launch it as you would in the real Explorer.
</P>
<p><a name="Fig11"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch02/images/02-11.jpg',563,347)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch02/images/02-11t.jpg"></A></P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you are one of those people who remember precisely where your files are and how they&#146;re spelled, you could type the path and the name of the application you want to run in the Run dialog box. But you have to know the full path, meaning you have to know what drive and folder the file is in. For most people, it&#146;s a lot easier to use the Run dialog box&#146;s Browse button.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Here are some added benefits of the Run menu. First, in addition to using it for running applications, you can use it to open and explore the contents of any disk device attached to your computer. For example, if you have two floppy drives and you want to see the contents of your B drive, you can go to the Run menu, type <tt>B:</TT> and press Enter. The mini-Explorer window opens and shows you the contents of the disk or drive.</P>
<p>Second, the Run command remembers what it has done for you in the past. Each time you use Run, it adds every file, folder, or drive that you launch or open to its drop-down list. Let&#146;s say you just ran your 3-D ray tracing program, either by typing the application&#146;s path and filename or by using the Run dialog box&#146;s Browse feature. You would never again need to type that program&#146;s path or browse for it, because after the first time you run it by means of the Run tool, you can just choose it from Run&#146;s drop-down list.</P>
<p>If you are familiar with the Run command from NT 4, you will remember the option to Run in Separate Memory Space. This option appears to be missing in Windows 2000, though the ability to start a 16-bit Windows application from the command prompt is still there. Hopefully this will be resolved by the time the finished product is released.</P><p><br></P>
