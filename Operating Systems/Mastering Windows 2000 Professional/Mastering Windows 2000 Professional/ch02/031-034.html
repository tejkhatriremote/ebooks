<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading10"></A><font color="#000077">Even Some Windows 95 Apps Won&#146;t Run</FONT></H4>
<p>Yes, it&#146;s true. The sad fact is that not <i>all</I> 32-bit Windows applications will run under Windows 2000. When Microsoft originally designed the requirements for creating Windows 95 programs, one of the specifications was that 32-bit applications that were designed for Windows 95 had to run under Windows NT as well. Microsoft later changed that requirement to state that programs don&#146;t <i>have</I> to run on Windows NT&#151;but <i>if</I> they don&#146;t, they&#146;re required to &#147;degrade gracefully.&#148; This means they aren&#146;t allowed to freeze the operating system when they fail.</P>
<p>Additionally, many application programmers just plain haven&#146;t figured out the correct way to write a 32-bit application, so they cobble together some of the 16-bit programs that they&#146;ve already written and understand and wrap a bit of 32-bit code around it, calling the result a Windows 95 application. Before you know it, Windows 95 is out of memory and you end up with a Windows 95 application that doesn&#146;t run under Windows 2000.</P>
<p>Finally, although Windows 9<i>x</I> certainly isn&#146;t the benchmark of quality for operating systems, it has one great strength when compared to NT and most other operating systems: its hardware support. Windows 9<i>x</I>&#146;s Plug-and-Play compatibility makes installing new hardware considerably easier than it ever was; NT traded that strength for its own strength of providing security against invalid hardware access. Windows 2000 has attempted to merge the strengths of both Windows 98 and NT into one operating system. It provides both the stability of NT when supporting applications, and the ease of Plug-and-Play support for installing hardware.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Not all 32-bit Windows 95 programs will run on Windows 2000. Be sure to ask if an application is NT and/or Windows 2000 compliant before you buy.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h3><a name="Heading11"></A><font color="#000077">Running Programs</FONT></H3>
<p>When you&#146;re using NT, the question isn&#146;t <i>what</I> program to run, it&#146;s deciding <i>how</I> to run it. Under Windows 3.<i>x</I> or the previous versions of NT (version 3.5<i>x</I>) there were two ways to run an application: You either double-clicked the program icon, or you typed the program name on a command line. Both of these approaches work under Windows 2000 as well, but now you have many more options.</P>
<p>Before we go any further, though, you must familiarize yourself with the main tools that Windows 2000 provides on its Desktop because these tools offer you the options that we present in the rest of this chapter.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading12"></A><font color="#000077">But First&#133;The User&#146;s View of the Desktop</FONT></H4>
<p>In previous versions of Windows, Program Manager <i>was</I> the Desktop, for all practical purposes. Sure, you could minimize Program Manager and look at the Desktop behind it, but you couldn&#146;t do anything with the Desktop except make it look pretty. In Windows 2000, the Desktop has become a fully integrated and essential part of the operating system. You can drag programs, files, and system objects onto it in order to organize them or launch them. (And, as in the old days of Windows, you can also customize the way the Desktop looks.)</P>
<p>In this overview section, we present the Desktop tools that every end user should learn to use. These are your interface tools; they are fundamental to your work with Windows 2000. For more detailed information on advanced and custom options available with any of the new Windows elements listed in this section, please see Chapter 4, &#147;Setting Object Properties.&#148;</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you already know Windows 98, you&#146;ll have an advantage when you begin to navigate around a Windows 2000 Desktop. The Taskbar, the Start button, Explorer, and My Computer are four elements that should look familiar. But when you open the Control Panel, it will look <i>very</I> different.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Taskbar</B></FONT></P>
<p>Located at the bottom of your screen (you can move it anytime you want to), the Taskbar is Windows 2000&#146;s information system. It constantly tells you what applications and files you have open, and whether you are printing, have e-mail, or have sound. Most important, the Taskbar (see the following illustration) is the permanent home of the <i>Start button</I>. Click this button to pop open the <i>Start menu</I>, discussed in the next section.</P>

<p><font size="+1"><b>Start Menu</B></FONT></P>
<p>As the name implies, everything on your computer can be initiated from the Start menu. Go to the Start button to pop open the Start menu, and you can launch any program, configure your computer, and access your most recently used documents, all with a click of your mouse&#151;and all without ever stopping the program you are using. The Start menu is also quite customizable: You can drag icons for your most frequently used applications or files to the Start button, which turns them into menu items that you can click. The Start menu appears below.

<p><font size="+1"><b>Right-Click Menus</B></FONT></P>
<p>Throughout the work you&#146;ve done with Windows, you may have noticed that you have two mouse buttons and that most of the time the right one (well, the one that isn&#146;t set up as your primary button) is useless. Windows 2000&#146;s new interface rectifies that situation by assigning the right-click action to pop up some kind of context-sensitive menu for almost every file, folder, drive, or any other object you&#146;ll encounter. <i>Context-sensitive</I> means that the menu is different depending on where you are in your task when you click the mouse button. Common commands include the ability to cut, copy, and paste, as well as the ability to send a document (using the Send To choice) directly to the printer or attach it to an e-mail message. In addition, almost every right-click menu offers a Properties choice, which is usually your fastest route to discovering the location of a program file in the path and folder hierarchy, and for adjusting the way the program or file behaves. An example of a right-click menu is shown in Figure 2.1. The Properties feature of right-click menus is discussed in detail in Chapter 4.</P>

Here&#146;s a menu that pops up when a user clicks a file listed in an Explorer window.<p><br></P>
