<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading9"></A><font color="#000077">Some DOS and Win3.<i>x</I> Apps Won&#146;t Run at All
</FONT></H4>
<p>Nearly all DOS and 16-bit Windows applications try to access hardware directly. We&#146;ll discuss this further in Chapter 3, &#147;Organizing Programs and Documents.&#148; Because Windows 2000 is trying to be a very stable operating system, it can&#146;t allow these programs to touch the hardware. Maybe you remember your father getting pretty unstable when you touch his nice clean car. The same principle applies here. If Windows 2000 cannot control your interaction with the hardware, it cannot guarantee the stability of anything you do.
</P>
<p>Windows 2000 could just terminate those wayward programs when they try to touch the hardware, but that would be very unfriendly. So what it tries to do instead is <i>simulate</I> the hardware. To do this, Windows 2000 uses a set of driver files called Virtual Device Drivers (VxDs), to imitate the hardware. So when the program tries to tweak the hardware directly, Windows 2000 will try to use a VxD to give the appearance that the hardware has actually been tweaked. This keeps the application happy, while also protecting the stability of the operating system. VxDs exist for all of the basic hardware devices: things like the mouse, the sound card, the keyboard, and so on.</P>
<p>The downside of these virtual device drivers is that in some cases they can have some pretty slow performance. Sometimes this can even lead to the program actually failing if it can&#146;t get the response it wants from the hardware. It really depends on how the program is written to use the hardware. If Windows 2000 can provide the proper support for the program, it will.</P>
<p>When the designers of Windows 2000 built all of Windows 2000&#146;s VxDs, they had to know what kinds of devices to build VxDs for in the first place. Most devices are easy; everybody has a keyboard, a mouse, and a video board. But what about the marginal stuff, like a proprietary scanner interface board or a fax board or perhaps a factory control interface card? Microsoft figured that those were small markets and didn&#146;t write VxDs for those boards. Of course, now that Windows 2000 provides utilities for these devices, you will find VxDs for many new hardware devices. Windows 2000 has added support for nearly all of the PC hardware on the market. If you have a device that is supported under Windows 98, it should work fine under Windows 2000.</P>
<p>Now consider what happens when you run a DOS or Windows 3.1 program that was built to work with one of these &#147;unusual&#148; boards. Windows 2000 sees the program attempt to directly access some hardware for which Windows 2000 has no VxD. What should Windows 2000 do? Remember Windows 2000&#146;s middle name: security. Windows 2000&#146;s design says, &#147;When in doubt, leave it out,&#148; and so Windows 2000 must terminate the DOS program. Is this design feature good or bad? Well, remember your choice: speed and compatibility vs. stability.</P>

<tr><td><font size="+1"><b>What Are the Differences Between 16-Bit and 32-Bit Programs?</B></FONT>
<p>At present in the world of Windows computing, there are two types of programs: <i>16-bit</I> and <i>32-bit</I>. Technically, the difference between them is that 16-bit programs are written in accordance with the Win16 API, and 32-bit programs are written in accordance with the Win32 API. API stands for application programming interface, which is a set of guidelines that programmers use when they are writing programs for specific operating systems.</P>
<p>More to the point, an API functions as a programmer&#146;s rule book. The rules concern how the program should go about its tasks: how it should write instructions into memory, how it should create windows, how it should send e-mail, and how it should handle every other function that a program needs an operating system for. Practically, there are two significant differences between 16-bit and 32-bit programs:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;32-bit programs will run only on Windows 9<i>x</I> or Windows 2000, and they&#146;ll sport far more sophisticated features than a 16-bit version of the program ever could. 32-bit programs will not run on Windows 3.<i>x</I> (that is, on Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups).
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;16-bit programs will run on any Windows platform (including NT and Windows 2000). In fact, they&#146;ll run better (fewer crashes) on Windows 2000 than they will on Windows 3.<i>x</I> because of Windows 2000&#146;s protected-mode support for 16-bit programs.
</DL>
<p>The real strength of 32-bit programs is that they take advantage of the strengths of Windows 2000: preemptive multitasking, a flat memory model, and the aforementioned protected-mode support. (These topics were all introduced in Chapter 1, &#147;Introducing Windows 2000 Professional.&#148;) When looking for new programs, if you are presented with a choice between a 32-bit program and a 16-bit program performing essentially the same function, choose the 32-bit program. You will get better performance, fewer crashes, and better integration with your Windows 2000 operating environment.
