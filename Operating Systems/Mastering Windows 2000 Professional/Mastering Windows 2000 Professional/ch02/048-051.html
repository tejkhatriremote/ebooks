<p><font size="+1"><b>Configuring the Taskbar</B></FONT></P>
<p>You can customize the Taskbar in many ways to make switching between applications even easier.
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The simplest thing you can do is to <i>reposition</I> the Taskbar to whichever side of your monitor screen you prefer: bottom (the default), top, left, or right. To reposition the Taskbar, just click it and drag it where you want it to go.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost as easy as repositioning the Taskbar is <i>resizing</I> it, to allow more or less of each Taskbar button to appear. Coincidentally, beyond a certain point, resizing also causes more or fewer of the buttons to appear, as a much greater height creates space for an extra row of buttons. To resize the Taskbar, move the mouse pointer to the boundary line between the Taskbar and the Desktop, at which point the pointer should change to a drag pointer, and then click and drag to increase or decrease the height or width of the bar.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>One edge of the Taskbar always extends across the full width or height of the screen, depending on which edge it is positioned along. You can only resize its smaller dimension.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The Taskbar tab of the Start menu&#146;s Properties dialog box (right-click in an empty area of the Taskbar to find the Properties option) lets you set other basic options for the Taskbar (and for the Start menu as well). The options are as follows:
</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Always on Top</B>
<dd>Keeps the Taskbar visible at all times. This is the default setting. (Screen saver programs ignore this setting, however, as they blank the entire screen.)
<dt><b>Auto Hide</B>
<dd>Makes the Taskbar disappear until such time as you move your mouse pointer to where the Taskbar is hidden. AutoHiding the Taskbar is useful if you have limited screen space, or if you just don&#146;t like the look of the Taskbar.
<dt><b>Show Small Icons in Start Menu</B>
<dd>Shrinks the size of the icons on the Start menu and removes the Windows 2000 Professional label that appears on the left side of the Start menu. If you have limited screen space or just want to reduce the size of the Start menu, use this option.
<dt><b>Show Clock</B>
<dd>Removes the clock that by default is displayed at the far end of the Taskbar. There is another Clock program in the Accessories group of your Start menu if you prefer.
</DL>

<h3><a name="Heading24"></A><font color="#000077">Making File Associations</FONT></H3>
<p>Not all your files and documents will hang around with just any program that will buy it a drink. Many types of documents need to be properly introduced to specific programs, and a real relationship must be defined, before they&#146;ll go out together. The way to do this is by <i>file association</I>. Essentially, this means that when you open files with certain filename extensions (such as <tt>.doc</TT>, <tt>.wp</TT>, and <tt>.xls</TT>, for example, among many, many others), Windows 2000 always identifies those files as ones to be opened in certain applications (such as Word, WordPerfect, and Excel, respectively, to continue the example).</P>
<p>For the most part, you don&#146;t need to worry about file associations&#151;the associations are set up automatically when you first install an application. Occasionally, however, associations are lost after a program crashes. Also, you might occasionally receive a file of an indiscernible file type from a business associate or a friend. In these cases, you may have to force the file into an association with the most likely application. If this happens, Windows 2000 prompts you to associate the file. Figure 2.7 shows the File Types tab of the My Computer window&#146;s View <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch02/images/02-05i.jpg"> Options choice, which is the primary tool for resetting file associations. The procedure is described in Chapter 3.</P>

<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch02/images/02-13.jpg',386,468)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 2.7</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can change file associations to &#147;attach&#148; specific types of files to specific applications.</P>
<p>An easy and safe way to change a program&#146;s file association is to select the program and hold down the Shift key while right-clicking. The right mouse menu appears with a new choice: Open With. Selecting this option enables you to change the existing file association.
</P>
<p>Windows 2000 uses file associations to keep track of what programs you use to open different types of applications. Each time you install a new application, it registers itself and the types of files it can open in Windows 2000&#146;s <i>Registry</I>. The Registry is like a database that keeps track of how your computer is configured, down to the tiniest detail. We&#146;ll put off discussing the Registry at length because it&#146;s a rather deep and complex topic, and most users shouldn&#146;t ever have to fiddle with it anyway. (It&#146;s the topic of Chapter 21, &#147;The Registry.&#148;)</P>
<h3><a name="Heading25"></A><font color="#000077">Finding Programs</FONT></H3>
<p>In the world of Windows 3.1, it was easy to find programs after they had been installed on your hard drive. Almost without fail, every new program was installed in a folder or directory that bore its name. With the birth of the new Explorer interface, that&#146;s not always true anymore. The 16-bit Windows and DOS applications continue to install themselves into their own folders, but many 32-bit programs install themselves a level deeper than that. They install inside their own folders, to be sure, but those folders are in turn installed in a folder called Program Files (see Figure 2.8). The idea behind this is that finding all your programs is easier if they are installed in the same place.
</P>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Keep in mind that with most programs, you are given the option to install your program into any folder you like. Install your programs where they make the most sense to you, but remember that if you ever need to refer to the program&#146;s manual for troubleshooting help, it will refer to files as though they are in the default setup location&#151;so for your own sake you should write your changes in the manual.<hr></FONT>
