<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">Understanding the Foundation Layer of DirectX</FONT></H4>
<p>The Foundation layer of DirectX 7&#146;s APIs is designed to handle the interaction of applications with today&#146;s high performance multimedia hardware such as video accelerators, sound cards, and video capture cards. This layer of services automatically detects you computer&#146;s hardware capabilities and sets the application&#146;s configuration to match, giving you the best performance possible.
</P>
<p>The Foundation layer provides support for 3D graphics and sound, 2D graphics acceleration, and input devices like joysticks and keyboards. The following components make up the Foundation layer:</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>DirectDraw</B>
<dd>This API provides many of the same graphics functions as the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) in the Executive Services of Windows 2000, but actually it can process most of them much faster than GDI. DirectDraw provides extremely fast direct access to the accelerated abilities of the video adapter. It also provides vendors with a great opportunity to develop hardware for Windows 2000 as all they need to do is take advantage of DirectDraw&#146;s hardware-independent graphics functions. DirectDraw supports 2D graphics acceleration and video codecs (compression and decompression services).
<dt><b>Direct3D Immediate Mode</B>
<dd>This API gives applications a way to directly access the advanced 3D rendering ability of most new video cards without requiring extra configuration from the user. Direct3D can use all of the features of Intel&#146;s MMX and Pentium III architecture as well as AMD&#146;s 3Dnow! Capable processors.
<dt><b>DirectSound</B>
<dd>Many of us remember multimedia programs or games where the sounds didn&#146;t quite match up with the pictures on the screen. One of DirectSound&#146;s best features is the ability to sequence sound and video so that this problem no longer occurs. DirectSound provides hardware-independent access to a sound card&#146;s mixing, playback, and recording features.
<dt><b>DirectMusic</B>
<dd>This is the pure music portion of DirectX. DirectMusic handles message-based sound like the Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) format. It also gives application developers the ability to design completely immersive soundtracks that can respond to the user&#146;s activities. Immersive soundtracks contain audio tracks to create the full surround-sound experience when played back over theater style speakers.
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>MIDI stands for Musical Instruments&#146; Digital Interface, and it enables synthesizers made by different manufacturers to &#147;talk&#148; to one another with a common set of commands. A specification called General MIDI is commonly implemented on PC sound cards. General MIDI commands can be recorded and saved as a MIDI sequence, which is basically a batch file of commands to turn specific notes on and off at exact times, using instruments from different synthesizers if more than one is present. The important distinction between a MIDI sequence and an audio wave file is that a MIDI sequence doesn&#146;t contain audio data, only instructions to be passed to a synthesizer that will produce the sounds. The main numbers you&#146;ll probably want to know are that the General MIDI patch set consists of 128 patches (a patch is a specific instrument sound, such as that made by a clarinet), and MIDI data can be transmitted and received on 16 MIDI channels.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<dt><b>DirectInput</B>
<dd>This API handles the user input from a variety of hardware such as force-feedback controllers, gamepads, joysticks, mice, and more. It includes support for the new Universal Serial Bus (USB) game controllers. It gives the application developer the ability to work with these devices in a completely hardware-independent manner.
</DL>

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading4"></A><font color="#000077">Understanding the Media Layer of DirectX</FONT></H4>
<p>The second layer of DirectX 7 is the Media layer. This layer is responsible for high-level functions, and works together with the Foundation layer to provide a full-featured multimedia experience.
</P>
<p>Among the responsibilities of the Media layer are handling of animation, media streaming, and interactivity. The media streaming is one part that you probably already use. It&#146;s the download and display of media from Internet sites that feature streaming media like movie clips, audio programs like radio, or broadcasts. The Media layer is comprised of the following API sets:</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Direct3D Retained Mode</B>
<dd>This API provides high level support for 3D graphics and animation. This is the media layer counterpart of the Direct3D Immediate mode that is part of the Foundation layer. It provides access to real-time three-dimensional graphics and animation capabilities for Internet applications, multimedia, and games.
<dt><b>DirectAnimation</B>
<dd>The DirectAnimation API provides the integration and timing support for 2D and 3D images, sound, movies, text, and vector graphics. This is the piece of code that ensures that the individual components of your 3D action game all work at the same time.
<dt><b>DirectPlay</B>
<dd>This API&#146;s job is to provide that thrilling, head-to-head competition across modem, LAN, or other Internet connection. DirectPlay allows game designers to concentrate on building the game rather than dealing with the network hardware.
<dt><b>DirectShow</B>
<dd>Spend any time watching movies on your computer? This API enables Windows 2000 to display MPEG, and <tt>.avi</TT> format videos, and even to play <tt>.wav</TT> audio files. DirectShow is also useful when using video capture hardware to record and edit digital video in Windows 2000.
<dt><b>DirectX Transform</B>
<dd>This last API set has an odd name, but it&#146;s very useful. DirectX Transform enables developers to build tools for editing and manipulating digital 2D or 3D images. It aids in animation, and in the development of graphics for Internet applications.
