<p><font size="+1"><b>Using Media Player Features for <i>.avi</I> Files
</B></FONT></P>
<p>Another lesser-known trick you can use with <tt>.avi</TT> files in Media Player is to double, triple, or even quadruple the frame size of the playback window. An <tt>.avi</TT> file may have an original (or <i>native</I>) frame size of only 320 &#215; 240 pixels. If you play this back on an 800 &#215; 600 pixel display, that frame will be pretty small. Before clicking the Play button, press Alt&#43;2 (hold down the Alt key and press the 2 key), and the frame size doubles. Pressing Alt&#43;3 and Alt&#43;4 triples and quadruples the frame size, respectively. This is especially handy if your graphics card has hardware features to smooth video playback image quality at larger frame sizes.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Watch out though&#151;if your graphics card lacks these features, and the frame size is too big, the video playback will seriously suffer and will look blocky. To return the frame to its original size, press Alt&#43;1.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Opening a File with Media Player</B></FONT></P>
<p>There are two ways to open a file with Media Player: by using the traditional File <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch07/images/07-01i.jpg"> Open sequence, or by clicking Device and selecting a media type. The latter is a little easier, because Media Player looks for only the specific media type you&#146;ve selected.</P>
<p>After the file has been opened, you can select Device <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch07/images/07-02i.jpg"> Properties, which brings up the Multimedia Control Panel&#146;s Device tab, covered earlier in the chapter. You can tweak properties of that specific media type, and then return to Media Player.</P>
<p>If you happen to get stuck, there&#146;s the ever-present Help applet for Media Player, which may answer your questions.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Media Player now includes support for playing Apple&#146;s QuickTime video format, as well as several other new formats including the new MP3 format for music.<hr></FONT>

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading17"></A><font color="#000077">Running CD Player</FONT></H4>
<p>Like Windows 98, Windows 2000 supports a CD-ROM feature called AutoPlay. When you insert a data CD-ROM or audio CD in your CD-ROM drive, Windows 2000 checks its format information. If it&#146;s a data CD, Windows 2000 looks for a file called <tt>autorun.bat</TT>, which is a batch file telling Windows 2000 what program on the CD to execute. If the CD is an audio CD, Windows 2000 launches its CD Player applet. In previous versions, NT played audio CDs using Media Player, and you still can, but CD Player gives you extra functions that Media Player lacks. Let&#146;s take a look at them.</P>
<p>Windows 2000 includes a new CD Player utility called CD Player Deluxe. This is the same utility that was included as part of Plus! 98 as an add-on to Windows 98. Those of you who used the CD Player in NT 4 will probably love this utility. Its interface looks remarkably like an in-dash CD player in your car, and it includes some very advanced features for tracking your music.</P>
<p>To manually launch CD Player, click the Start menu, select Programs <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch07/images/07-03i.jpg"> Accessories <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch07/images/07-04i.jpg"> Entertainment, and click the CD Player&#146;s icon. Figure 7.13 shows the CD Player window. The first things you see are the transport controls like those found on a home CD player: Play, Pause, Stop, Go to Previous Track, Scan Back, Scan Forward, Go to Next Track, and Eject CD.</P>

<p>You will also notice that there are no pull-down menus in this CD Player. The entire configuration is done through the Options button in the main interface. The Options menu contains the following items:
</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Preferences</B>
<dd>Provides access to the main configuration settings of CD Player, and even controls the default CD Audio settings for Windows 2000. This option also sets the preferences for Album Information such as how to connect over the Internet to download track information, and lets you view the current albums in your playlist.
<dt><b>Playlists</B>
<dd>This command opens the Preferences dialog box and goes directly to the Playlists tab.
<dt><b>Tiny View</B>
<dd>Goes to the very compact view of the utility, displaying only the Options, Play, Stop, Eject, and Track buttons. It also shows a small timer display. If you are already in Tiny View, this command is replaced with Normal to resume the default view of CD Player.
<dt><b>CD Player Help</B>
<dd>Opens the online help utility for CD Player.
<dt><b>About CD Player</B>
<dd>Displays the version information for CD Player. This is a traditional Windows About dialog. It contains information on the registered owner of the operating system, and the amount of physical memory available to Windows.
<dt><b>Exit</B>
<dd>Closes the CD Player utility.
</DL>

<p>CD Player Deluxe also includes the ability to download album information from the Internet. This is a great timesaver for those of us who like to have the track names entered in for each audio CD. The Internet button in the main interface gives you access to these features. When you start CD Player it will automatically try to download the information for the album from one of two Internet sites, either Music Boulevard or Tunes.com. If your Internet connection is not currently available, CD Player will queue the request and wait until the next time you connect to the Internet to retrieve the information. You can customize this behavior in the Preferences dialog on the Album Options sheet.
