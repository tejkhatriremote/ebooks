<p><font size="+1"><b>Specifying Recording Quality</B></FONT></P>
<p>You can also specify the default recording quality that the Sound Recorder applet uses. Windows 2000 ships with three quality settings called Telephone Quality, Radio Quality, and CD Quality. These three quality settings use different sample rates and bit-depths, and set whether the recording will be mono or stereo. As the names suggest, these settings approximate those respective audio qualities, with better quality requiring more hard-drive space to record the same amount of sound. We go into more detail about digital sound quality when we look at Sound Recorder later in this chapter.
</P>
<p>To adjust these settings in the Sounds and Multimedia Properties, use the Audio tab and click the Advanced button for the device you want to change. This opens another properties sheet that enables you to select the quality vs. the processor usage using a pair of slider controls.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading12"></A><font color="#000077">MIDI Tools</FONT></H4>
<p>The MIDI tab Music Playback drop-down list on the Audio tab of the Sounds and Multimedia Properties dialog box enables you to specify which MIDI device you wish to use. If you don&#146;t have any external MIDI devices connected to your PC (via your sound card&#146;s joystick port), you&#146;ll want to use your sound card&#146;s default device, which in our example is the Sound Blaster FM Synthesis device. But remember, in our installation example, we have a Roland SCD-10 General MIDI daughtercard attached to our Sound Blaster. To make it the default MIDI device, select the Creative Labs Sound Blaster 1.5 device. Then MIDI instructions are redirected to the Sound Blaster&#146;s MIDI OUT and the Roland daughtercard, which delivers markedly better instrument sound quality.
</P>
<p>To change the properties of the specified MIDI device, you will need to change the properties on the Hardware tab described later in this chapter. To change the settings of your MIDI device, use these steps:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the Sounds and Multimedia applet in Control Panel.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Hardware tab (see Figure 7.8).
<p><a name="Fig8"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch07/images/07-08.jpg',367,448)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch07/images/07-08t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch07/images/07-08.jpg',367,448)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 7.8</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hardware tab of the Sounds and Multimedia applet gives you access to the MIDI settings of your sound card. Here the Hardware tab displays the list of audio devices that can be adjusted.</P>
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Double-click your sound card in the Devices list. If you have more than one, double-click the card that will control the MIDI instruments. This will open the properties sheet for the sound card. (You can also single-click your sound card and press the Properties button.)
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the General tab of the properties sheet that appears, you can decide whether to use the MIDI capabilities of this device. You can also click the Settings button to bring up the resources for the sound card.
<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Details tab. The Details tab enables you to install instrument definition files, which enable the MIDI device to send output to specific musical instruments.
<dd><b>6.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click OK or Apply to save the changes. Click OK when you are finished making changes to close the dialog box. Click OK again to close the properties sheet for the sound card.
</DL>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading13"></A><font color="#000077">Multimedia Device Information</FONT></H4>
<p>Of the four tabs in the Sounds and Multimedia Properties dialog box, the Hardware tab conveys about as much information as the other four combined. This dialog box (shown earlier, in Figure 7.8) lists your installed multimedia hardware, software controls, audio and video decompression types, as well as video capture devices. It gets a little tricky here, because normally devices are present only where you see the plus sign in a box. But in this dialog box, MIDI devices are present even though there&#146;s no plus sign by that item.
</P>
<p>In addition to being able to change settings for multimedia hardware, you can also access the Windows 2000 Troubleshooters for each of the devices through this interface if you are having trouble with them. The following sections explain the items listed in the Devices section of the Hardware tab.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Audio Devices</B></FONT></P>
<p>The Devices list shows any sound cards you have installed. Double-clicking the icon expands the list to show the installed devices. If you want more information about a specific device, select it and click Properties. You will see a dialog box that lets you specify that you want to allow audio tasks to be passed to this specific device, or you can tell Windows 2000 to bypass it if you want to use another device.
</P>
<p>If you want to look at what I/O resources the sound card is using, open the Properties for the device and click Settings. Windows 2000 then takes you through the sound card&#146;s I/O resource settings in much the same way that it did when you first installed the sound card.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>MIDI Devices and Instruments</B></FONT></P>
<p>The Devices list in Figure 7.8 also shows any MIDI devices you have installed. To see a list of available devices, double-click the device type. When double-clicked, the device type exapnds into a tree structure in order to display the device under that type heading. If you&#146;re a serious &#147;MIDI-head&#148; and want to define custom instruments, here&#146;s where you can do it. You&#146;ll need to obtain an Instrument Definition File that has the <tt>.idf</TT> extension to tell Windows 2000 what specific patches that synthesizer has and where they&#146;re located. Unless you plan on doing some serious audio production on your PC, you don&#146;t need to worry much about this option. Just use your default MIDI devices, and you&#146;ll be fine.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Media Control Devices</B></FONT></P>
<p>Media control devices are drivers that let you play back and record different media types. An MCI driver also gives you &#147;transport&#148; controls&#151;Play, Stop, Fast Forward, Rewind, Record, Goto Start, Goto End&#151;for these media types. Double-clicking the Media Control Devices icon from the Devices list shows you a list of Windows 2000&#146;s four default MCI drivers: CD Audio, Video for Windows, MIDI Sequencer, and Sound. You can select Properties for any of these MCI drivers, and then click the Settings button in the Properties dialog box, which will take you to the Audio tab described earlier. A software MPEG player is also included with Windows 2000, and it enables you to watch and listen to MPEG-encoded files.
