<p>After you reboot, you can change your screen resolution by right-clicking the Desktop and selecting Properties. When the Display Properties dialog box comes up, click the Settings tab. In this dialog box, you can increase your screen resolution or increase your color depth to 256 (8-bit), 65,530 (16-bit), or 16.7 million colors (24-bit). You can also change your monitor&#146;s refresh rate. Windows 2000 enables you to apply new display settings without requiring you to reboot. You can simply press Apply or OK to apply the new settings. The system will pop up a dialog box that tells you the display will be reset for 15 seconds and then automatically revert if you don&#146;t decide to keep the new setting. This is a great new feature that&#146;s actually been around for a while in Windows.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>As a rule, you want to run your monitor at a minimum vertical refresh rate of 72Hz. This faster rate cuts down on perceptible flicker, decreasing eye fatigue during long periods of uninterrupted viewing. Windows 2000 can use Plug and Play to detect the settings for your monitor, if you have a Plug-and-Play monitor. Before increasing your monitor&#146;s refresh rate, consult its documentation to find out its maximum refresh rate at the screen resolution and color depth at which you&#146;re running. Although you can run most monitors at a setting beyond their specified maximum refresh rate, you will more than likely damage the monitor&#146;s display circuitry by pushing it faster than it is intended to run.<hr></FONT>

<h3><a name="Heading9"></A><font color="#000077">Assigning Sounds to System Events</FONT></H3>
<p>After your sound card is installed, you will hear occasional sounds when certain system events occur. You can assign different sounds for different events, ranging from the default system beep to the sound that is played when a window is minimized. Windows 2000&#146;s default sounds give aural cues to system events, but they&#146;re not particularly exciting. The good news is you can easily change Windows 2000&#146;s system event sounds to be any <tt>.wav</TT> file by selecting the Sounds icon in Control Panel. If you&#146;ve downloaded <tt>.wav</TT> files you like from the Internet or some online service, you can swap these sounds for Windows 2000&#146;s default sounds. Here&#146;s how:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open Control Panel by clicking the Start button, selecting Settings, and clicking Control Panel&#146;s icon.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Double-click the Sounds and Multimedia icon. You&#146;ll see the Sounds and Multimedia Properties dialog box, shown in Figure 7.6.

<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch07/images/07-06.jpg',367,448)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 7.6</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the Sounds and Multimedia Properties dialog box, you can assign any <tt>.wav</TT> file to be a system event.
</P>
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can click any event and assign a <tt>.wav</TT> file sound to it. If you&#146;re not sure what a certain <tt>.wav</TT> file sounds like, you can preview it by clicking the Play button in the dialog box.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you&#146;ve assigned certain <tt>.wav</TT> files to events and like that configuration, you can save it as a Sound Scheme by clicking Save As and giving the Scheme a name. If you change sound event assignments and then decide that you want to return to your original Scheme, you can select it from the Schemes field, and those <tt>.wav</TT> files will be reassigned to the system events you had previously chosen.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you (or your neighbors) find system events a bit annoying, you can select (None), and no sound will play when that event occurs.<hr></FONT>

<h3><a name="Heading10"></A><font color="#000077">Using Multimedia Tools</FONT></H3>
<p>So now you&#146;ve installed your sound card and that burnin&#146; new graphics accelerator, and you&#146;re ready to rock and roll. Let&#146;s check out some of the multimedia software components and controls that make the cool stuff happen. Open the Control Panel and double-click the Sounds and Multimedia icon. The Sounds and Multimedia Control Panel contains a variety of tools for working with sounds and graphics.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading11"></A><font color="#000077">Audio Tools</FONT></H4>
<p>Click the Audio tab in the Sounds and Multimedia Properties dialog box to display the dialog box shown in Figure 7.7. You should see your selected audio device, which is the ESS Maestro in our example. If you&#146;re one of those brave souls who has more than one sound card in their system, you can select which one you want to use as your default audio device. Some wave editors let you pick which audio device you want to use. If you click to put a check mark in the Use Preferred Devices Only check box, any wave audio software will use only the device that you select, and it won&#146;t be able to see the others.

<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>A <i>wave editor</I> is a program that lets you perform complex audio editing functions on <tt>.wav</TT> files and audio files in other formats such as Apple&#146;s <tt>.aiff</TT> or Sun&#146;s <tt>.au</TT>. These functions include adding effects such as reverb, chorus, fade-ins, and fade-outs; flanging/phase shifting; applying new Equalizer (EQ) parameters; and mixing several <tt>.wav</TT> files together. Wave editors are used by professional audio engineers and enthusiasts alike and several excellent wave editors such as CoolEdit are available for download from the Internet.<hr></FONT>

<p><font size="+1"><b>Adjusting Audio Levels</B></FONT></P>
<p>In the Audio dialog box, you can also tweak the audio level for both playback and recording by pressing the Volume button next to the option you want to adjust. This opens the Volume Control applet for either recording or playback devices.
</P>
<p>Once the Volume Control is open, you can adjust the volume for one specific device or the overall volume for all devices by moving the slider controls. This applet mimics the actions of a mixer board, and is in fact the interface to your sound card&#146;s mixer capabilities.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Enabling or Disabling the Speaker Icon</B></FONT></P>
<p>You can also enable or disable the display of a speaker icon on the Taskbar. Double-clicking this speaker icon brings up the Volume Control applet. Right-clicking the speaker icon displays the Sounds tab of the Sounds and Multimedia Properties dialog box. There is a check box on this tab that determines whether or not the Speaker icon will appear on the Taskbar.
