<h3><a name="Heading5"></A><font color="#000077">Installing Multimedia Hardware</FONT></H3>
<p>Multimedia hardware used to be a royal pain to install, but being properly prepared can help you steer clear of installation pitfalls and get up and running quickly. You will also find that the new Plug-and-Play capabilities of Windows 2000 will make this far easier than it was in NT 4. In this section, we offer some guidelines for selecting your multimedia hardware, and then we go into the specifics of how to install a sound card and graphics card.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading6"></A><font color="#000077">Choosing Multimedia Hardware</FONT></H4>
<p>Adding multimedia hardware to your Windows 2000 system livens things up, but hardware costs can add up too, so shop around. Because new products are coming out at such a rapid rate, any specific product recommendations made here would be old news by the time you read this book. But a few simple guidelines, explained in the following sections, can help you through the process.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Graphics Boards</B></FONT></P>
<p>A wide variety of graphics boards are currently on the market. Before you shop for a board, consider how you&#146;ll be using it. Is the board mostly for business applications? Will you be running digital video-intensive multimedia applications that use Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) standards? Will you be watching DVD movies or using the television output to display movies or games on your TV? After you decide what kind of applications you want to run, you can buy exactly the horsepower you need.
</P>
<p>Most cards support some digital video acceleration, but better boards support x-y interpolation (also called bilinear interpolation) and color space conversion. You&#146;ll want a minimum of 4MB of RAM on any graphics board you buy so you can run programs at higher resolutions. In fact, the minimum RAM for all but the cheapest cards is now 8 or 16MB. For less than &#36;200, there are a wide variety of graphics accelerators that should be more than adequate for your multimedia adventures.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Sound Cards</B></FONT></P>
<p>Here again, you have many players to choose from. Sound Blaster is always a good bet because of its market dominance. As when you shop for graphics boards, it&#146;s good to have an idea how you&#146;ll be using the sound board. In some cases, it&#146;s better to skimp a little here and spend the saved money on higher-quality speakers. On the other hand, many of the better (and more expensive) sound cards support 3D surround-sound suitable for a home theater experience. If this is your dream, then do some research to find the card that supports all of the features you want, but be prepared to spend some money to get what you want.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>In PCs today, there are two types of MIDI synthesizers: FM and Wavetable. FM synthesis was brought to the market by Yamaha in the 1980s and became popular with professional musicians. FM synthesis uses several sine waves (called operators) to produce its sounds. Although some of the sounds are convincing, many lack authenticity. Less expensive sound cards usually have only FM synthesizers. But a newer synthesis technique called Wavetable lookup gained favor in the late 1980s for its superior instrument quality. Wavetable lookup stores short recordings (called samples) of the instrument being synthesized. Many mid- and high-end sound cards now have Wavetable lookup synthesizers on them. But not all that glitters is gold. If you&#146;re going to be getting into MIDI, try to listen to a demo of a sound card&#146;s Wavetable lookup synthesizer before you buy. All performance numbers aside, your ears are the best judge.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Speakers</B></FONT></P>
<p>As with a home stereo, your overall audio quality depends heavily on the quality of your speakers. If you spend the money to get a good sound card with lots of bells and whistles but play it through squawk-box speakers, the overall effect will be disappointing.
</P>
<p>Good computer speakers are available for &#36;100 or less a pair, which includes a sub-woofer for extra bass response. You can also run your PC&#146;s audio into your home stereo, though if your sound card is given to popping and crackling, these types of noises can damage speaker drivers. Be sure to either turn your amplifier volume down when powering your PC up or down, or switch the amplifier to another input channel.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading7"></A><font color="#000077">Installing a Sound Card</FONT></H4>
<p>Sound cards are infamous for their cruel and unusual installation procedures, making you learn far more than you probably wanted to about the inner workings of your PC. Most installation woes stem from a sound card&#146;s need for many I/O resources. Some sound cards need at least two base I/O addresses, two IRQs, and two direct memory access (DMA) channels. If you&#146;re installing a sound card into an already-crowded system, it&#146;s easy to wind up with I/O resource conflicts, where the sound card and another hardware device fight to use the same resources. The result is often that neither device will work correctly.
</P>
<p>This is one of the areas where the new Plug-and-Play capabilities of Windows 2000 will really shine. Installing a sound card in Windows 2000 is a much less painful experience than it was in NT 4. Of course, you still must have available hardware resources in your computer, or you <i>will</I> have conflicts.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Tracking Hardware Device I/O Resources</B></FONT></P>
<p>It&#146;s a good idea to keep a table of I/O resources that each of your installed hardware devices uses. When you add a new device, you can check this information and avoid the headaches of I/O resource conflicts. Table 7.1 shows typical hardware you might find in a garden-variety PC and the I/O resources used.
