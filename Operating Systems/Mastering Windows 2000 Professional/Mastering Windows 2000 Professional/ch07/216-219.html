<p><font size="+1"><b>Troubleshooting When You Don&#146;t Hear the Start-Up Sound</B></FONT></P>
<p>If you didn&#146;t hear the Windows Logon Sound when you restarted Windows 2000, follow these steps to check your settings:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Go into Control Panel, select the Add/Remove Hardware icon, then select Add/Troubleshoot a Device and click Next.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the list of installed hardware is displayed, select the sound card and click Next. A sample list is shown in Figure 7.5.
<p><a name="Fig5"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch07/images/07-05.jpg',503,385)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch07/images/07-05t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch07/images/07-05.jpg',503,385)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 7.5</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Troubleshooting an installed device can be done through the Add/Remove Hardware Wizard in Control panel.</P>
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard displays a summary of the device status, indicating what it thinks the problem is. When you click Finish, the Add/Remove Hardware Wizard closes and the Troubleshooter opens.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 2000 Help opens with the entry for the specific error code displayed. Many devices actually have a detailed Troubleshooter tool within Help that can walk you through the steps necessary to resolving your hardware issue.
</DL>
<p>If the resource settings do match the ones you selected on the hardware, either your hardware settings are incorrect or the sound card may be defective. Power the computer down and open it up, being careful to ground yourself to the PC&#146;s metal chassis by touching the metal frame of the computer. Remove the card and verify its settings. If the settings are correct, they match the ones you selected in the Control Panel, and you&#146;re sure there are no I/O conflicts with other devices, the sound card may be defective. You will need to replace the sound card itself.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading8"></A><font color="#000077">Installing a Graphics Card</FONT></H4>
<p>Fortunately, installing a graphics board is a somewhat less involved endeavor than installing a sound card, but there are still a few pitfalls to avoid. Suppose that you&#146;ve got a sluggish graphics board, and you&#146;ve decided to replace it with a faster one with more features. First, you need to make sure that any new graphics accelerator you purchase has Windows 2000 drivers. Many new boards do have them, but check with the vendor to be sure. After you have your Windows 2000-ready graphics accelerator, you can begin.
</P>
<p>The graphics drivers for Windows NT 4 were completely redesigned. This was because of the changes in the architecture that moved the GDI from User mode to Kernel mode (see Chapter 1 for more details). As a result, you could not use graphics drivers from earlier versions of Windows NT. The drivers for Windows 2000 are redesigned again, this time to make them compliant with the Windows Driver Model (WDM), which unifies the drivers for Windows 9<i>x</I> and 2000 into one library. This means that if you don&#146;t have a driver specific to Windows 2000 you can try a driver for Windows 98.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you&#146;re running your old graphics adapter at 800 &#215; 600 or 1024 &#215; 768, move all your icons toward the center of the display so that when you reboot at 640 &#215; 480 to install your new drivers you&#146;ll be able to see your Start button and all your icons.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Follow these steps to install the graphics board and driver:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your PC, being sure to touch its metal chassis to discharge any static electricity (it can fry a computer circuit) before touching any of the boards. Remove your old graphics adapter and replace it with the new one. Replace the cover on your PC, and power the unit up.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you first boot the computer with the new video card in place, let it boot normally. With the new Plug-and-Play capability Windows 2000 should be able to detect the new card and automatically use the default settings to boot. If it does, then you can stop here. If not, then proceed to Step 3.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Boot the computer again, this time use the VGA Mode. The boot menu displays the various options for booting the computer, if you have more than Windows 2000 Professional installed. If not, then you&#146;ll see the option to boot Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional. You can press the F8 key to get to the advanced boot menu. On this menu, if you have any problems booting with the new video card, select Enable VGA Mode and press the Enter key.
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>VGA (Video Graphics Adapter), first developed in 1987, has become the most standard display mode that graphics boards support, and is usually a 640 &#215; 480 pixel display with 16 colors.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;After the machine boots up, Open Control Panel and run the Add/Remove Hardware applet to detect and install the video card. Click Next to begin the wizard.
<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Add/Troubleshoot a Device, then click Next.
<dd><b>6.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard will search for any Plug-and-Play devices, and very likely will find the new video card at this point. If it doesn&#146;t, select Add a New Device and click Next.
<dd><b>7.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell the wizard to Search for New hardware, then click Next.
<dd><b>8.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Add/Remove Hardware wizard should locate your new video card during the first portion of the search. If it doesn&#146;t, you may need to verify that there aren&#146;t any hardware conflicts. The wizard should display a list of detected hardware and allow you to choose which device you want to install drivers for. Click Next to proceed.
<dd><b>9.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 2000 will copy the drivers, or prompt you for the location of the driver from the manufacturer. When you click next, the wizard will display a list of the options you installed.
<dd><b>10.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Summary page, click Finish to complete the installation. You may be prompted to shut down and restart the computer to complete the installation.
