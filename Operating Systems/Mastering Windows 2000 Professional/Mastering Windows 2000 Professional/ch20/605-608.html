</DL>
<p><big><big>I</BIG></BIG>nstalling Windows 2000 is a fairly straightforward procedure. It is even easier if you know your machine and think about the logistics for a moment before you begin. Although the installation procedure is more time-consuming than it is for some applications, you do have an alternative to standing over the computer and responding to dozens of installation questions. You can write a setup batch script that will automatically answer all those questions. But first, this chapter provides a step-by-step guide to installing Windows 2000 on its own and also as a link to the server. Then we explain how Windows 2000 interacts with the server and other operating systems, how to install it efficiently to several machines using the batch routine, and how to install fonts.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Knowing Your Computer Needs</FONT></H3>
<p>First and foremost, make sure your computer has the CPU, disk space, and RAM necessary for the operating system. And just as important, be sure you have all the hardware you need to install and operate Windows 2000 Professional smoothly. Next, ascertain whether the computer will be a stand-alone workstation or part of a domain. Determine also if Windows 2000 Professional will be the only operating system on the machine or if another OS, such as Windows 9<i>x</I>, will be present as well. Let&#146;s talk about each of these steps.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">Reviewing Your Hardware Requirements</FONT></H4>
<p>You need to make sure you have all the hardware necessary to install and operate Windows 2000 effectively. Hardware requirements are outlined in the following sections.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>CPU</B></FONT></P>
<p>The CPU must be at least a 166MHz Pentium-class processor or compatible (Windows 2000 doesn&#146;t run on 486 machines anymore). This requirement shouldn&#146;t be too much of a problem now, as it has become difficult to buy anything less than a Pentium II.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>RAM</B></FONT></P>
<p>The amount of RAM you need to run Windows 2000 Professional depends on your patience. The minimum recommendation is 32MB, which works but is very slow; 64MB of RAM provides a more satisfying speed. Don&#146;t worry, though. If you don&#146;t have 64MB of RAM and haven&#146;t worked with a machine that does, you won&#146;t know what you are missing. You don&#146;t have to rush out and get more RAM. Do remember, however, that Windows 2000 gets faster when you add more RAM. With today&#146;s memory prices, it&#146;s easy to consider running Windows 2000 on 128MB or even 256MB.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Hard Disk</B></FONT></P>
<p>Windows 2000 is more demanding in this area as well. To install Windows 2000 Professional, you will need at least a 2GB disk (don&#146;t worry, though, you won&#146;t need all of it), with at least 650MB free. Windows 2000 will pre-install nearly all of its drivers, so a lot of that space will be storage for those drivers.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>CD-ROM</B></FONT></P>
<p>You can install Windows 2000 from a CD-ROM in either of two ways: from three floppy boot disks and a CD-ROM, or from a CD-ROM by itself. For installation on a single workstation, the three-floppy method doesn&#146;t sound too bad, but that step just gets the installation process going. You still need the CD-ROM. The Setup program copies files from the CD to the floppies to start the installation. In a CD-only installation, however, Setup instead copies the files to your hard drive. If you have enough space on your hard drive, you don&#146;t need to use floppies.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Many computers now support booting from the CD-ROM. Windows 2000 CD-ROMs are bootable on machines that support this feature. This means you can insert the CD-ROM, boot the machine, and enter directly into Setup. You may have to change the boot order settings in your computer&#146;s BIOS to activate this feature.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading4"></A><font color="#000077">Installing Windows 2000 as a Stand-Alone Workstation or Domain Member</FONT></H4>
<p>Determine whether this computer will be a stand-alone workstation or part of a domain. If it is to be part of a domain, the installation program will ask you several questions. The domain installation process is faster and easier if you know the following:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The type of network card installed in the computer. Some network cards require the user to adjust the manufacturer&#146;s default settings. Before installing, run a diagnostic tool such as WinMSD to determine what these settings should be, and then write them down so that you can refer to them later.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The protocol(s) the machine uses to connect to the domain controller (server).
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your computer&#146;s set Internet Protocol (IP) address, unless you have a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server to determine your computer&#146;s IP address. If you do have a DHCP server on your network, a static IP address isn&#146;t required. Ask your system administrator if you don&#146;t know whether your network has a DHCP server.
</DL>
<p>As you can see, making the machine part of a domain necessitates the addition of a network card. If you do not have a network card set up when you install Windows 2000 Professional, you can still continue the installation process. Just set up the computer as a stand-alone machine and make it part of a domain after you install the network card.
</P>
<p>Yes, you read that correctly. Changing your mind about having the workstation as part of domain does not mean completely reinstalling Windows 2000. One great feature of Windows 2000 Professional is that you can work through those kinds of administrative details quite simply by running a program. The option of quickly adding a workstation to a domain at any time can be rather handy. You&#146;ll find out how to connect a workstation to a domain in the &#147;Setting Up Domain and Administrator Accounts&#148; section later in this chapter.</P><p><br></P>
