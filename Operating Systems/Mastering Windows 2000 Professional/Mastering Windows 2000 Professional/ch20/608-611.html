<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading5"></A><font color="#000077">Deciding Whether to Keep Other Operating Systems</FONT></H4>
<p>You need to decide whether you want the current operating system(s) to remain in place or if you want Windows 2000 Professional to be your only operating system. As you&#146;ve probably just surmised, the good news is that you can have more than one operating system on your computer.
</P>
<p>The bad news is that some applications installed on your old operating system will not run on Windows 2000 without being reinstalled.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Some applications install files in the system directory. When you try to run these applications on Windows 2000, it looks for those files in the Windows 2000 directory when they are really in the Windows directory.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Simply copying the files from one directory to another does not work because the applications still look for the files in the other operating system directory that it can&#146;t open. Hence, you&#146;ll need to install the applications on both operating systems. Reinstalling software takes time and can use a lot of space on the hard drive. Therefore, you must think carefully about how you will use that space before opting to have applications run on more than one operating system. See the &#147;Using Dual Operating Systems&#148; section toward the end of this chapter for more help with this option.

<h3><a name="Heading6"></A><font color="#000077">Understanding Windows 2000 Terminology</FONT></H3>
<p>Windows 2000 Professional is in some ways a server and workstation built into one. It has some of the same diagnostic tools that Windows 2000 Server has. Windows 2000 Professional can accommodate different users on the workstation by providing each user with Desktop settings and file security. It also requires an administrator to oversee all activity on the workstation, just as a server has an administrator to oversee the domain. This similarity of function and terminology can get confusing, especially when a connection exists between the workstation and a domain. Let&#146;s take a moment to avoid some confusion by defining a few frequently used terms:
</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Domain</B>
<dd>A logical group of interconnected computers on a network controlled by a domain controller.
<dt><b>Domain controller</B>
<dd>A computer that controls the domain. This computer functions as a &#147;gatekeeper&#148; for all of a domain&#146;s shared items. The domain controller keeps a database of security information and uses that information to validate requests from workstations for network resources.
<dt><b>Administrator</B>
<dd>Traditionally, a person who has administrator privileges on a server&#151;that is, abilities (which users do not have) to control the server and domain.
<br>Now it gets trickier. A workstation requires an administrator just as a domain does. A workstation administrator has nothing to do with a domain administrator, however. A workstation administrator has control over the workstation settings (for example, network card or display settings) and its users. A domain administrator controls aspects of the domain such as controlling user access or backup operations. The two are separate entities. Anyone who logs on as a workstation administrator cannot automatically make changes to the domain, and vice versa.
<dt><b>User</B>
<dd>Again, users are users regardless of whether they are working on a stand-alone workstation or have access to the server files.

<h3><a name="Heading7"></A><font color="#000077">Installing a Stand-Alone Windows 2000 Professional Computer</FONT></H3>
<p>Find a form of installation&#151;from CD-ROM or network location&#151;that works for your setup needs. A CD-ROM installation is more convenient than a floppy disk installation for many reasons. The benefits of a CD-ROM installation are no disk swapping, faster installation time, and the ability to perform an automated installation. Even if you don&#146;t have a CD-ROM drive, think about getting one&#151;and not just for installing Windows 2000. Many software packages have become so huge that even games are being shipped on CDs. Because CDs can hold more data than floppy disks, CD programs usually include more features and options. Some CDs are able to read data faster than the average hard disk. Lots of great programs are out there but you can&#146;t get them if you don&#146;t have a CD-ROM. The other option&#151;installing from a network location&#151;also offers speed, especially if you are upgrading from NT. It is possible in this scenario to copy files from multiple locations at the same time. More on that later.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you have the room, we recommend putting a copy of the installation directory for your machine and its contents on the hard drive where you are installing Windows 2000 Professional. Why? First, you may need to reinstall Windows 2000 Professional on your computer when you do not have a Windows 2000 Professional CD available. Second, when installing on some machines, the CD-ROM becomes inaccessible halfway through the installation. Installing Windows 2000 Professional from your hard disk can save you a lot of aggravation and wasted time. Third, putting a copy of the Windows 2000 Professional CD on the server is a good backup measure in case the CD is missing. However, do remember that you can&#146;t install a workstation using this directory because you will not be able to access the network from the workstation until the installation has finished.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading8"></A><font color="#000077">Installing Windows 2000 Professional from a CD-ROM</FONT></H4>
<p>If you&#146;re installing Windows 2000 from a CD, you may want to note the drive letter that your CD-ROM uses. Even though your CD-ROM may use a drive letter, say, Z, when installing Windows 2000, that won&#146;t be the drive letter Windows 2000 uses during the installation process. Windows 2000 automatically chooses the next available drive letter for the CD-ROM instead of the one that you had previously assigned to it. For example, if you have a hard drive using drive C, and D is not being used, Windows 2000 would pick D for the CD-ROM drive. However, the Setup program still thinks that the drive letter for your CD-ROM is drive Z. To install Windows 2000 Professional, you have to change the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive to the next unused letter. Your other option is to perform a floppyless installation from your hard disk.
</P>
<p>There are two ways to install from a CD-ROM. The first (and easiest) way is to install Windows 2000 directly from the CD. The other way is to use floppy disks to start the installation and to use the CD to finish the setup process. The first method works well if you have the CD-ROM driver installed on your system already. If you don&#146;t, you need to either boot from floppies first or install the driver to DOS before you can install Windows 2000. Here is the process for installing on an Intel or compatible platform:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the command prompt and change directories to the I386 directory on your CD-ROM.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Type <b>WINNT32</B> (or <b>WINNT</B> when running from MS-DOS or Windows 3.<i>x</I>) at the command line.
</DL>
<p>WINNT32 enables only a user with administrative privileges to install Windows 2000 Professional while running NT Workstation. This security feature restricts everyone but an administrator from overwriting the current version of NT Workstation while it is still running, but it can be a problem if an administrator wants to delegate the task to users. If you mind sharing the administrator&#146;s password (and we hope you do), reinstalling Windows 2000 through another operating system may be the best idea.
