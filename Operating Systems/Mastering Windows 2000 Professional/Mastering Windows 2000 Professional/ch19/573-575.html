<p><big><big>I</BIG></BIG>f you&#146;ve been a DOS, OS/2, Windows 9<i>x</I>, or Windows 3.<i>x</I> user, you&#146;ll find that although you have to learn a fair number of concepts to be a Windows 2000 expert, most of them will be somewhat familiar because similar elements appear in all operating systems. For example, you have to learn about the Windows 2000 Registry, but Windows 95 has a Registry as well; you have to learn about attaching your workstation to your network, but the process is similar to attaching a DOS or Windows client to a network; and although the procedure for setting up new device drivers under Windows 2000 is unlike the procedure under any other operating system, it has some parallels to the way you do it in Windows for Workgroups. That&#146;s all good news because it makes the job of becoming a Windows 2000 expert easier. But one concept about Windows 2000 is completely new and unfamiliar to the experienced PC user&#151;security.</P>
<p>Unlike some other operating systems, Windows 2000 requires you to create a user account for yourself right on your PC before you can do anything on that PC. Yes, the idea that you must create your own user account on your personal PC before you can do anything with the PC is unusual&#151;after all, most of us are accustomed to requiring <i>network</I> accounts, but not particular accounts on a workstation. But, as your father might say when you complain that something you don&#146;t like isn&#146;t fair&#151;Get used to it!</P>
<p>The user account is an integral part of Windows 2000 and has some great benefits. For example, suppose you and Sue share a computer. You can set up the computer so that you own a directory on the hard disk and Sue owns another directory on the hard disk and <i>it is completely impossible for Sue to access your data</I> (and vice versa). Windows 2000 was built with security in mind, so exploit that power!</P>
<p>If you can understand how a lock and key provide security, then you can understand how Windows 2000 accomplishes security. Here&#146;s the scenario: You&#146;re sitting at your workstation running Word, you click File <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch19/images/19-01i.jpg"> Open, and choose a file named <tt>report.doc</TT>. Word tries to read that file, and &#8230;</P>
<p>&#8230;Well, so far, this all sounds pretty normal; nothing is different here from what you have seen under Windows or DOS. But in Windows 2000, you can&#146;t touch anything (a file, a printer, a directory) unless you have the proper permission to touch it. Every access is checked by a piece of Windows 2000 called the <i>Security Reference Monitor</I> (SRM). The SRM checks to see if you have the permissions to access <tt>report.doc</TT> and if you do, then Word will load <tt>report.doc</TT>.</P>
<p>The extremely compressed version of what&#146;s going on under the hood is this: When you log on, you get a &#147;key,&#148; called a <i>Security Access Token</I> (SAT). Every object under Windows 2000 has a &#147;lock,&#148; called its <i>Security Descriptor</I> (SD). The key (SAT) must fit the lock (SD), or you don&#146;t get to the file. This chapter shows you how to set up the keys and the locks so that you&#146;re not constantly stumbling up against Windows 2000 security&#151;while enabling you to protect your workstation&#146;s data from unwanted access.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Many people use the term <i>Access Token</I> instead of the term <i>Security Access Token</I> (SAT) used in this book. They are one and the same.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Understanding User Accounts in Windows 2000</FONT></H3>
<p>As you have just read, you must create separate user accounts on a Windows 2000 machine before any user can log on to the Windows 2000 workstation&#151;and, unlike Windows 9<i>x</I>, Windows 2000 won&#146;t let you get anywhere until you log on. You can&#146;t avoid the logon screen. You create user accounts with a Control Panel applet called Users and Passwords, which you&#146;ll meet later in this chapter. The user accounts sit in a database called the <i>Security Accounts Manager</I>, or SAM.</P>
<p>For simplicity&#146;s sake, let us define some account terminology. The full name of a user account on an Windows 2000 Professional computer is the machine&#146;s name, a backslash, and the username&#151;for example, if your account name is Mark on a machine named M133, then your account&#146;s full name is M133\Mark. Windows 2000 allows you to create user groups, which are accounts that contain other accounts. By default, every machine has a group named Users, and every user account is automatically a member of it (except the Guest account, which you&#146;ll meet later in this chapter). Your M133\Mark account, then, is by default a member of M133\Users.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">Accessing a File: Three Scenarios</FONT></H3>
<p>Let&#146;s consider now how Word reads a file. (Keep the lock-and-key analogy in mind.)
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the simplest case, you log on to your local PC and then try to access a file on your local computer.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In a somewhat more complex case, you might try to access a file on another computer via your network.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the most complex case, you log on to a <i>domain</I>, rather than your local PC, and then access a file over the network.
</DL>
<p>Thankfully, these three scenarios have more similarities than differences, making them easy to understand.
