<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading9"></A><font color="#000077">Creating User Groups</FONT></H4>
<p>Under the Groups folder in Computer Management <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch19/images/19-03i.jpg"> Local Users and Groups, you see the <i>user groups</I> that this machine&#146;s SAM contains. Each user group has different functions that it can perform. The following are the default groups that any Windows 2000 Professional machine contains:</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Administrators</B>
<dd>Can do just about anything to the computer. The things that they can do that no other type of user can do include loading and unloading device drivers, managing security audit functions, and taking ownership of files and other objects.
<dt><b>Backup Operators</B>
<dd>Can log on to the computer and run backups or perform restores. You might put someone in this group if you wanted him to be able to get on your system and run backups, but not to have complete administrative control.
<dt><b>Guests</B>
<dd>Have very minimal access to network resources.
<dt><b>Power Users</B>
<dd>Have a few more capabilities than do regular users. They can create new printer and file shares, change the system time, force the system to shut down from another system, and change priorities of processes in the system. They can&#146;t run backups, load or unload device drivers, or take ownership.
<dt><b>Replicator</B>
<dd>Enables your computer to receive replicated files from an NT Server machine. We won&#146;t discuss that process here, as you can&#146;t do it without a Windows 2000 Server PC.
<dt><b>Users</B>
<dd>Can run programs and access data on a computer, shut it down, and access data on the computer from over the network.
</DL>

<p>Adding or deleting someone from a group is fairly simple. Just double-click that group, and you&#146;ll get a list of who&#146;s in it. You can then add or delete someone from the group through the graphical user interface.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading10"></A><font color="#000077">Understanding User Rights</FONT></H4>
<p>But what&#146;s this about shutting down the machine or loading and unloading drivers? Well, actually, the notion of a <i>user right</I> is an integral part of how Windows 2000 security works. Basically, the difference between regular old users and administrators lies in the kinds of actions that they can perform; for example, administrators can create new user accounts but regular old users cannot. In Windows 2000 terminology, the ability to perform a particular function is a user right. Most user rights are pretty self-explanatory, but a few can use some clarification. User rights in Windows 2000 Professional are found in the Local Security Policy console in Administrative Tools. Once you&#146;ve opened that console, expand the Local Policies <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch19/images/19-04i.jpg"> User Rights Assignment console tree, and then double-click the right you want to change.</P>
<p><a name="Fig6"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch19/images/19-06.jpg',650,492)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch19/images/19-06t.jpg"></A></P>
<p>If you have the right to access this computer from the network, then you can use data on this computer from another computer on the network (provided, of course, that you have access to that particular piece of data). You&#146;ll note that Everyone&#151;that&#146;s the name of a special pre-created group that includes, well, <i>everyone</I>&#151;can access data from this computer over the network. Here&#146;s a list some of the rights and, where necessary, what they mean and what they&#146;re good for:</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Back Up Files and Directories</B>
<dd>Run backup utilities.
<dt><b>Change the System Time</B>
<dd>For some reason, not just anybody can change the system clock; it&#146;s a right. (Of course, you could always reboot the computer in DOS or go straight to the setup program in CMOS to reset the time, so it&#146;s not a very airtight security feature.)
<dt><b>Force Shutdown from a Remote System</B>
<dd>Some utilities let you pick a Windows 2000 machine and force it to shut down, even though you&#146;re not logged on to that machine. (One such utility comes with the Resource Kit.) Because you wouldn&#146;t want just anybody doing a forced shutdown, Microsoft made this a right.
<dt><b>Load and Unload Device Drivers</B>
<dd>A device driver is not only a video driver or SCSI driver; a device driver may be part of a software application or operating system subsystem. Without this right, you&#146;ll often be unable to install new software and you&#146;ll usually be unable to change drivers or add and remove parts of the operating system.
<dt><b>Log on Locally</B>
<dd>Sit down at the computer and log on.
<dt><b>Manage Auditing and Security Log</B>
<dd>You can optionally turn on a Windows 2000 Security log, which will report every single action that woke up the SRM, the LSA, or any other part of the security subsystems in Windows 2000. You can learn more about the log by clicking Policy <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch19/images/19-05i.jpg"> Auditing. In general, we don&#146;t recommend using the Security log because the output is quite cryptic and can be <i>huge</I>; logging all security events can fill up your hard disk quickly, and the CPU overhead of keeping track of the log will slow down your computer. You can&#146;t enable any security logging unless you have this right.
<dt><b>Restore Files and Directories</B>
<dd>As the name states.
<dt><b>Take Ownership of Files or Other Objects</B>
<dd>If you have this right, then you can seize control of any file, directory, or other object even if you&#146;re not <i>supposed</I> to have access to it. This right is obviously quite powerful, which is why only administrators have it.
</DL>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The user right to Take Ownership of Files or Other Objects is the secret to the administrator&#146;s power. You can do whatever you like to keep an administrator out of your data, but remember that the administrator can always take ownership of the file, and as owner do whatever they want to the file including changing permissions. You cannot keep an administrator out; you can only make it difficult to get in.<hr></FONT>
