<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading16"></A><font color="#000077">Choosing File Access Permissions</FONT></H4>
<p>The bottom part of the Security tab of the file&#146;s Properties dialog box controls the kind of access you get. By default, it&#146;s Full Control for the Everyone group, but several other options are available: Write, Read, Read and Execute, and Modify. Full Control can be modified by special accesses, but we get to that in a minute.
</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Write</B>
<dd>Allows a user to write a file to a folder if they have this permission. On a file, this permission doesn&#146;t have much meaning since the file is already created, but you may see files with this permission if they inherited the permission from the parent folder. A user with Write permission can write attributes, read permissions, and synchronize the file or folder.
<dt><b>Read</B>
<dd>Means that you can look at the contents of a file, examine the file&#146;s attributes (read-only, system, hidden, and whatever other user-defined attributes the file may have), and display the file&#146;s &#147;owner&#148; (a concept we get to a bit later) and permissions.
<dt><b>Read and Execute</B>
<dd>The same as Read permission, except that you can also execute the file if it is a program file.
<dt><b>Modify</B>
<dd>Lets you do everything you can do with Read access&#151;look at a file, its attributes, permissions, and owner, as well as run the file if it&#146;s a program&#151;and adds the ability to <i>change</I> the file attributes and the data in the file, as well as to delete the file altogether. A person with Modify permission cannot delete subfolders or files within those subfolders unless they have explicit permission to do so, meaning they have to have Modify permission for the subfolders also. Note that someone with Modify access <i>cannot</I> change the file&#146;s owner.
<dt><b>Full Control</B>
<dd>Exactly like Modify access except that it adds the ability to change a file&#146;s owner and the very file permissions that you are working with right now.
</DL>

<p>If those five levels of access are a bit coarse for your needs, you can fine-tune someone&#146;s access with what Microsoft calls <i>Special Access</I>. To modify the special access permissions for a file or folder, click the Advanced button on the Security tab for that object. This will open the Access Control Settings dialog box shown in Figure 19.12. This dialog box is used to directly set the special access for the object, as well as setting the auditing and ownership. You can add or remove accounts and permissions on this dialog.</P>
<p>To view the special access permissions, click the account whose permissions you want to modify, and click the View/Edit button. Now you have more options:</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Traverse Folder/Execute File</B>
<dd>You can change directory through this folder, and you can run this file.
<dt><b>List Folder/Read Data</B>
<dd>You can read the contents of a file and display the contents of a folder.
<dt><b>Read Attributes</B>
<dd>Allows you to display the current attributes of a file or folder.
<dt><b>Read Extended Attributes</B>
<dd>Enables you to display the extended attributes of a file or folder, if there are any.
<dt><b>Create Files/Write Data</B>
<dd>Allows you to write data to a new file. When applied to a folder, this permission means you can write files into the folder, but not view what&#146;s already in the folder.
<dt><b>Create Folders/Append Data</B>
<dd>Means you can make new folders in this location, and you can append data to existing files.
<dt><b>Write Attributes</B>
<dd>Gives you the ability to modify the attributes of a file or folder.
<dt><b>Write Extended Attributes</B>
<dd>Allows you to create extended attributes for a file or folder.
<dt><b>Delete Subfolders and Files</B>
<dd>This permission gives you the ability to remove folders contained within the folder you&#146;re working in, and the files contained in them.
<dt><b>Delete</B>
<dd>Allows you to delete files.
<dt><b>Read Permissions</B>
<dd>Makes it possible to display the current permissions list for the file or folder.
<dt><b>Change Permissions</B>
<dd>Enables you to modify the permissions for the file or folder. This permission is normally only included in Full Control.
<dt><b>Take Ownership</B>
<dd>Gives you the ability to claim ownership of a file or folder.
<dt><b>Synchronize</B>
<dd>Allows you to synchronize the files or folders for offline viewing when you are not connected to the network.
</DL>

<p>These permissions have changed quite a bit from previous versions of NT in which you had only six permissions to make up the standard permissions: Read, Write, Execute, Delete, Take Ownership, and Change Permissions. The new levels of granularity make security a more difficult topic to learn in Windows 2000, but it gives a skilled administrator much finer control over how files and folders will be accessed.
</P>
<p>One subtle change you may have already noticed is that there is no longer an explicit No Access permission. This is very likely a good thing, since No Access had several pitfalls. For instance, if you assigned No Access for the Everyone group to the root of your C: drive or to the System32 folder, you could actually prevent NT from booting. Other problems included not getting access to a resource you <i>should</I> be able to access, because one of the groups you belong to has been given No Access.</P>
<p>To prevent someone from accessing a file or folder, you have two choices. The first way, and usually the best, is to simply not grant the person access to the file or folder. That means, don&#146;t add their account to the list of permissions. Not having explicit permission is like having No Access; either way, you don&#146;t get in. The second method is to add the person&#146;s account to the permissions list, but check Deny for each permission. This creates an explicit No Access-type permission.</P>
