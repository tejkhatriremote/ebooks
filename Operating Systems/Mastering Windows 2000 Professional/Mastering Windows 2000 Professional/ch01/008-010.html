<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading4"></A><font color="#000077">What&#146;s Not in Windows 2000?</FONT></H4>
<p>The following is a very short list of features not available in Windows 2000.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>No MSN Support</B></FONT></P>
<p>The much-talked-about Microsoft Network (MSN) software that was a key part of Windows 95 is not available in Windows 2000. However, you can still use MSN as an Internet service provider (ISP), for use with Microsoft IE or the Web browser of your choice. Look for an MSN client to be released for Windows 2000 in the near future.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>No Support for MIPS or PowerPC Chips</B></FONT></P>
<p>Windows 2000 has discontinued support for the MIPS and PowerPC processors. These platforms haven&#146;t been very well represented in the marketplace, and the development effort put into the approximately 36 million lines of code for Windows 2000 demands that only the most prevalent systems be supported.
</P>
<h3><a name="Heading5"></A><font color="#000077">Why Choose Windows 2000 over Windows 98?</FONT></H3>
<p>Given that their interfaces are so similar, it would be a fair question to ask why you should choose one over the other. The answer is pretty straightforward. Windows 2000 may look like Windows 98, but it does many things that Windows 98 can&#146;t. For starters, Windows 2000 is a secure operating system. Just try and log on to a Windows 2000 computer without the correct password. You can&#146;t do it. In Windows 98? Just press the Esc key and you&#146;re in! The lesson here is, if you have data that absolutely, positively needs to be kept secret, Windows 2000 is the operating system for you.
</P>
<p>As discussed elsewhere in this book, Windows 2000 is also the most complete 32-bit environment you can buy. If you need an operating system that won&#146;t crash and won&#146;t shut down on you, Windows 2000 is the one for you.</P>
<p>How different is Windows 2000 from Windows 98? Both use the same style interface; both are 32-bit operating systems. But after that, the similarity ends. Although they are both 32-bit operating systems, they implement their 32-bitness in much different ways. Table 1.1 lists the differences, which are explained below in greater detail.</P>

<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading6"></A><font color="#000077">HAL and Plug and Play</FONT></H4>
<p>When Plug and Play was introduced with Windows 95, most users quickly accepted it as one of the best things since sliced bread. After years of tweaking features such as Interrupt Requests and Direct Memory Access with jumpers or switches, the concept of installing a new adapter card in your computer and having the operating system simply say &#147;Hey, I notice you have a new card there&#133;Would you like me to install and configure the driver for you?&#148; was a huge step forward. Plug and Play depends on the operating system continuously polling the Basic Input/Output Services (BIOS) of the computer to determine what hardware is present. So for Plug and Play to work, your computer must have a Plug-and-Play BIOS to gather the basic information from the devices, such as which hardware resources they need. Plug and Play also depends on a Plug-and-Play operating system to know what to do with information from the devices. Windows 95 did that fairly well, as does Windows 98. The Plug-and-Play agents in Windows 9<i>x</I> poll the BIOS to see what hardware is present and what interrupts it needs, and then communicate that information back to the operating system to keep the hardware and software functioning in harmony. This process presumes a certain type of BIOS and a certain type of central processing unit (CPU), namely a Pentium processor or another member of the <i>x</I>86 processor family.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The term <i>x86</I> is shorthand for the class of computers that are backward compatible with the Intel 8086 chip. These include computers using the 8088, 80286, 80386, 80486, or 80586 (Pentium), 80686 (Pentium Pro, or Pentium II or III) chips. For the sake of this discussion, you can also assume that <i>x</I>86 refers to the Intel-compatible CPUs from manufacturers such as Cyrix and AMD.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Unfortunately for Windows NT users, Plug and Play wasn&#146;t so easy to implement in NT. Windows NT uses the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to provide an interface between the operating system kernel and the hardware in the computer. The HAL is what makes it possible to port NT to so many different computer types, so it&#146;s a good thing to have, but the downside is that makes adding Plug and Play to the operating system very difficult.
