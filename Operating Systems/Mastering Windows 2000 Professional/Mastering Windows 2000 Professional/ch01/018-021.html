<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading19"></A><font color="#000077">Kernel Mode</FONT></H4>
<p>Nothing happens in the Windows 2000 universe without the operating system knowing about it and giving its blessing. The Kernel is the core of Windows 2000. It is responsible for acting as a &#147;gofer&#148; between the operating system and the computer&#146;s processor. As such, it is responsible for scheduling all of Windows 2000&#146;s interactions with your computer. The Kernel also manages all the interrelationships between the different Kernel mode operations. It does this by means of <i>threads</I>. A thread is a series of instructions that are attached to a command that is executed by a program. Threads include memory addresses, scheduling for the amount of time the process will take, and anything else that describes the process.</P>
<p>The Kernel mode is divided into three subsections. From the bottom up, these are the HAL, the Kernel, and Executive Services. As you can see in Figure 1.1, Executive Services is subdivided further into its own component parts.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>The HAL and the Kernel</B></FONT></P>
<p>The HAL controls the interaction between the Kernel and the system hardware. One of the design goals of Windows 2000 was the capability to be easily ported from one type of computer to another. To this end, the HAL <i>abstracts</I> the hardware from the Kernel so that it does not need to know what type of hardware is installed in the computer. This extends to running multiple processors in your computer. Windows 2000 is one of the only PC-based operating systems that can take advantage of symmetric multiprocessing. The abstraction provided by the HAL gives Windows 2000 greater stability.</P>
<p>Because of the abstraction provided by the HAL, software that attempts to directly access the hardware is not permitted to run. The HAL, working with the Kernel, stops those programs dead in their tracks. For performance reasons, many DOS programs&#151;particularly games&#151;use direct hardware access. Programs written for Windows 2000 don&#146;t need to worry about how to access the hardware; they just ask the operating system for support, and Windows 2000 takes care of the rest.</P>
<p>Windows 2000 does have some communication that bypasses the HAL and goes directly to the hardware. In each of these cases, the communication is between the Executive Services and the individual drivers for hardware devices such as the video card and network card. But the concept of hardware abstraction is still maintained.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Executive Services</B></FONT></P>
<p>Executive Services is a set of separate components that complete the underpinnings of Windows 2000&#146;s Kernel mode. Look back at Figure 1.1 to get an idea of how the components work together. Each of the Executive Services controls a specific function. The following is a brief overview of each of those functions.
</P>
<p><b>I/O Manager</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I/O Manager handles all communication between your applications and your hard disk. Additionally, it manages drivers for different file formats (FAT, NTFS) and keeps the Windows 2000 Kernel informed of the hard drive&#146;s status. I/O Manager also manages network cards and modems. In short, this manager controls any device that delivers data to or from the computer. Its components are illustrated in Figure 1.2.</P>
<p><a name="Fig2"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch01/images/01-02.jpg',200,199)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch01/images/01-02t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch01/images/01-02.jpg',200,199)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 1.2</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;I/O Manager is built to simultaneously control multiple devices and drivers.</P>
<p>I/O Manager is divided into the following sections:
</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Cache Manager</B>
<dd>Monitors your use of disk cache and disk pages.
<dt><b>File Systems</B>
<dd>Manage the file systems you have installed on your computer.
<dt><b>Network Drivers</B>
<dd>Control your network cards and network protocols.
<dt><b>Device Drivers</B>
<dd>Manage the hardware you have in your computer. This includes everything from your hard drive(s) and modem to your keyboard and mouse.
</DL>

<p><b>Object Manager</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Object Manager manages all the system objects that are used by Windows 2000. An object is a piece of data used by the operating system to create system events. Objects are acted upon by processes. Every object has a handle (yes, that&#146;s the technical term) that a process connects to in order to complete its job. The Object Manager is extensible, meaning that it can be expanded and added to as new object types are developed.</P>
<p><b>Security Reference Monitor</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Security Reference Monitor is the &#147;watchdog&#148; for Windows 2000. Security Reference Monitor assigns security tokens and authenticates users each time they execute a task.</P>
<p><b>Process Manager</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Process Manager is the complement to Object Manager. Process Manager manages the creation and deletion of processes. A process is a set of threads combined with a memory address and the necessary objects needed to complete a system task. The Process Manager works in conjunction with the Security Reference Monitor to ensure that every process is assigned a security token.</P>
<p><b>Local Procedure Call Facility</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Local Procedure Call facility acts as a negotiator between User mode and Kernel mode. From an internal standpoint, NT uses a client-server model to administer itself. Just as Windows 2000 Professional connects to Windows 2000 Server and requests services from it, the Windows 2000 User mode requests services from the Windows 2000 Kernel mode. Those requests are handled by local procedure calls. Local procedure calls are also used in standard client-server networks.</P>
<p><b>Virtual Memory Manager</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtual Memory Manager oversees how Windows 2000 uses virtual memory. In Chapter 18, you&#146;ll see how Windows 2000 uses a flat memory model. To increase the amount of usable memory space, Windows 2000 uses hard-disk space as memory when it runs out of memory (which can happen fairly quickly with some high-powered programs). The disk memory is known as <i>virtual</I> memory.</P>
<p><b>Win32K and GDI</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Win32K and Graphics Device Interface (GDI) are the graphics subsystem of Windows 2000. The graphics functions in earlier versions of Windows NT were provided by the Win32 subsystem in User mode. Microsoft moved the graphics subsystem into the Executive Services for version 4 to give the graphics functions a performance boost. In fact, this resulted in the single greatest increase in the apparent speed of Windows NT 4.</P><p><br></P>
