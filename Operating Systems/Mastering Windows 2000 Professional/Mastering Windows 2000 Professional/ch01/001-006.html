<p><big><big>S</BIG></BIG>ince the advent of the personal computer, users have desired three things in their operating systems: power, stability, and usability. Windows 2000 Professional has all these and more in abundance. Since its inception in 1993, Windows NT has featured an indefatigable 32-bit architecture, complete with built-in networking and the capability to run almost every piece of Windows software on the market. (Leave your DOS and Windows 3.1 utilities and diagnostic software on the shelf, though&#151;they won&#146;t work correctly with NT&#146;s 32-bit architecture.) Windows 2000 Professional now includes an interface, which has evolved from the NT 4 Explorer shell and is even easier to use.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Windows 2000 is actually version 5 of Windows NT. Throughout the book we make many references to NT in describing Windows 2000. The name change was a sign of the convergence of the Windows product lines.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>What does all this mean to the consumer, the person sitting at a desk 52 weeks a year who just wants to be a productive computer user? It means a lot. It means a fast, modern operating system with a slew of advanced features that ensure the computer will almost never crash. It means an operating system that can host the emerging multitude of 32-bit software applications, some of which offer amazing facilities for professional audio and video recording, editing, and broadcasting. It means a new interface, which offers users tremendous control over how the system performs its tasks and how it maintains its connections to peripherals and to other computers.
</P>
<p>In this chapter, we give you an overview of Windows 2000 Professional: what&#146;s new, what&#146;s different, and what&#146;s under the hood. We compare Windows 2000 Professional to other operating systems you may be familiar with and emphasize comparisons between Windows 2000 Professional and previous versions of Windows (especially Windows 3.1 and 3.11, but also Windows 98 and the previous versions of NT). Most of the topics introduced in this chapter are expanded upon and continued in later chapters, but you&#146;ll find a lot here to whet your appetite.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2000 Server: Which Is Which?</FONT></H3>
<p>There are two basic &#147;flavors&#148; of Windows 2000: <i>Professional</I> and <i>Server</I>. It might be easier to think of Windows 2000 Server as the big brother of Windows 2000 Professional; they&#146;re from the same family but a little different in size. Both versions of Windows 2000 are solid, 32-bit operating systems, with C2 Level security and built-in networking. Both feature the Windows 2000 interface. Windows 2000 Professional is an operating system designed for corporate and high-end users who want a robust and powerful operating environment. Windows 2000 Server does everything that Windows 2000 Professional does and adds a comprehensive set of tools for managing and administering a network. It is designed to run on a network file server or application server. There are also additional versions of Windows 2000 Server, intended for more specialized environments, such as cluster servers and data warehousing. For more information on these versions, consult <i>Mastering Windows 2000 Server</I> by Mark Minasi from Sybex.</P>
<p>Everything that we discuss in this book is relevant for both flavors of Windows 2000, but we do not discuss the advanced networking administration features found in Windows 2000 <i>Server</I>. (Not to worry, though, networkers: In Part V of this book we <i>do</I> cover the administration features that let you manage the built-in networking capabilities of Windows 2000 <i>Professional</I>, including its remote access services.)</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">What&#146;s New in Windows 2000?</FONT></H4>
<p>Windows 2000 is a mix of old and new. It carries on the legacy of Windows NT including most of NT&#146;s strengths and architecture, but adds many new features. Windows 2000 is much more than just Windows NT 5. It represents the convergence of technologies from Windows 9<i>x</I> and Windows NT. Once again, Microsoft has developed an operating system designed for ease of use, fantastic hardware support, and technology that sets new standards.</P>
<p>Nearly all of the functionality of NT 4 has been preserved, though many of the tools have new locations and new looks in Windows 2000. The most obvious changes lie in the consolidation of the administration tools into the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), a one-stop shopping place for your management needs. Seriously, though, the MMC provides the ability to manage your entire computer from one toolbar. You will also notice changes in the appearance of the Control Panel and Explorer. Even the Desktop has changed. Don&#146;t worry if the new interface and its new tools seem unfamiliar now, we will be covering them in detail throughout this book.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Explorer and My Computer</B></FONT></P>
<p>Explorer and My Computer may seem familiar to you from NT 4 or Windows 98. They actually are most similar to Windows 98, though Windows 2000 adds some differences as well. Explorer gives you the ability to easily browse for resources on your system, and to manage the properties of files and folders with ease. My Computer gives you a slightly different interface to the same information that many people will find easier and more intuitive for browsing the computer.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Drag-and-Drop Anything</B></FONT></P>
<p>You can now easily drag-and-drop almost any file or program, even a printer or hard drive, to almost any sensible place in your computer&#146;s environment. Drag a file to the printer icon and the file will print. Drag a printer icon to your network&#146;s Printers folder to set the printer up to be shared among additional users.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Plug-and-Play Support</B></FONT></P>
<p>At long last, your wishes have been answered! Windows 2000 includes full Plug-and-Play support, along with drivers for nearly all of today&#146;s computer hardware. This will enable you to quickly install new hardware into your computer and have Windows 2000 find and configure the drivers for you.
