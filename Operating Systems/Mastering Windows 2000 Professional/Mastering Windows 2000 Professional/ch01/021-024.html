<p>In Windows 2000&#146;s User mode, each of your programs runs in a separate memory space, an arrangement that protects each program from the others in case one should crash. This is true for 32-bit and 16-bit programs, both Windows and DOS.
</P>
<p>The User mode is divided into subsystems. Each subsystem handles a different type of application and can report directly to the Kernel mode. The subsystems are described briefly in Table 1.3.</P>

<td>Win32
<td>Administers 32-bit and 16-bit Windows programs.
<tr>
<td>OS/2
<td>Administers character-based OS/2 programs.
<tr>
<td valign="TOP">POSIX
<td>Administers POSIX programs, which are Unix hybrids that can be run on any POSIX-compliant system, including Windows 2000. They are written to a series of application programming interfaces (APIs) that are platform independent. They control interaction with system components such as hard drives and memory.
<tr>
<td valign="TOP">Security
<td>Administers system security and manages security tokens, monitors, and passwords. The User mode portion of the Security subsystem runs only during a user logon. For more information on security tokens and the security subsystem, please refer to Chapter 19, &#147;Living with Windows 2000&#146;s Strict Security.&#148;
<tr>
<td colspan="2"><hr>
</TABLE>
<p>In addition to the subsystems noted in Table 1.3, User mode may also contain VDMs. A VDM simulates a computer running MS-DOS 5, with 16MB of RAM and conventional, expanded, and extended memory. As stated earlier in this chapter, this simulation makes it possible to run MS-DOS programs on Windows 2000. It also enables you to run 16-bit Windows applications by simulating Windows 3.1 running on that MS-DOS computer with 16MB of memory. By default, Windows 2000 starts all 16-bit Windows applications in the same WOW environment. This simulates exactly the environment the programs were written to operate in under Windows 3.1. However, Windows 2000 gives you the ability to start the application in a separate memory space, which creates another WOW for each 16-bit Windows application.
</P>
<p>Remember that the WOW environment imitates Windows 3.1 so well that it even hangs just like the old Windows did! That means that if one of your 16-bit Windows applications crashes, it will take all the other 16-bit applications with it&#151;unless you have chosen to start them in their own memory spaces, in which case the other 16-bit programs will keep running without a problem.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If a 16-bit application crashes, it will also crash any other program running in the same memory space. If this happens, you can stop the WOW using Task Manager and restart the 16-bit program. All 32-bit applications will be unaffected by the crash and continue to run normally.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h3><a name="Heading21"></A><font color="#000077">Summary</FONT></H3>
<p>By now, you should have a good idea of what Windows 2000 Professional is and isn&#146;t. This may sound complicated, (and it is) but it&#146;s also easy to learn. The new Explorer interface offers huge leaps in usability that make it a simple task to harness the power and complexity of this state-of-the-art operating system.
</P>
<p>You may be saying to yourself at this point, however, &#147;Who cares about C2 level security and flat memory models. I just want to get my work done and increase my productivity so I can get a raise.&#148; Well said, and rightly so. That&#146;s just what the rest of this book is about. Consider this, though: Now that you&#146;ve begun to understand what the operating system does and how it differs from others that you may be more accustomed to, you&#146;re in a much better position to make the best use of the information you&#146;ll find in the following chapters.</P>
<p>In the next chapter, we discuss the single most important thing you can do under any operating system&#151;run programs. From there we go on to organizing programs, using OLE and making it work magic for you, customizing Windows 2000 (you&#146;ll be amazed at the custom changes you can make to reflect your own personal approach to computing), configuring Windows 2000 for printing, taking advantage of the best in multimedia (a feature set that is much, much improved over NT 4), using e-mail, networking and working over the Internet, and everything else you ever wanted to know about how to make the best use of Windows 2000.</P>
<p>So sit back, press Control&#43;Alt&#43;Delete to log on to your Windows 2000 system, and let&#146;s go!</P><p><br></P>
