<p><big><big>D</BIG></BIG>espite Windows 2000&#146;s resilient nature, it still sometimes crashes. Some crashes are caused by random events: It really <i>is</I> possible for a cosmic ray to hit a critical part of a chip and freeze up a PC (and in that case there&#146;s not much to do other than to turn the machine off and then back on). But if you find Windows 2000 crashing <i>regularly</I>, you have to do something about it, &#146;cause it&#146;s not supposed to. Of course, to do something effective about system crashes, you&#146;ll need a method, and that&#146;s what this chapter offers.</P>
<p>We&#146;ll avoid trotting out all the old an-ounce-of-prevention bromides (though there <i>is</I> a lot of truth to those old saws). We start off with a discussion of preventing trouble in the first place and then look at techniques you can use to gather the information needed to ascertain, attack, and fix problems that may sooner or later arise.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Avoiding Windows 2000 Crashes</FONT></H3>
<p>You can keep Windows 2000 trouble away in a few basic ways:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Buy reliable hardware.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Protect the machine from environmental hazards, most notably substandard electric power.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Install Windows 2000 properly, or in some cases, <i>re</I>install Windows 2000 properly.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtain the latest tested drivers for your hardware.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Always shut down Windows 2000 properly.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Back up your hard disk.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure you have the proper security level for whatever function you&#146;re performing.
</DL>
<p>Let&#146;s look quickly at each of these.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">Buy Reliable Hardware</FONT></H4>
<p>One of the things that causes instability for <i>any</I> PC operating system is the hardware that the operating system must sit atop. PCs made by IBM were once the standard and, right or wrong, &#147;PC compatible,&#148; which meant that they &#147;did the same thing that the IBM machines did, including the bugs.&#148; Nowadays, there <i>is</I> no standard, and so no two brands of computers work exactly the same way.</P>
<p>A major point of difference between makes and models of computers is the expansion bus, the slots on a PC motherboard into which you plug expansion cards such as video boards, sound cards, network boards, and sound boards. Because these slots must accommodate the connectors on the bottom of the expansion cards, the person who designs the motherboard and the person who designs the expansion card must agree on how that interface should work; the interface must be <i>standard</I>.</P>
<p>That&#146;s where the problem arises. The most common PC interface standard is called the Industry Standard Architecture, or ISA, board. The <i>problem</I> with the ISA standard is that it&#146;s not really a standard; there is no carved-in-stone specification for it, just an informal industry consensus. The result is that if you take a &#147;standard&#148; ISA board and plug it into a &#147;standard&#148; ISA slot, it may not work perfectly 100 percent of the time. It&#146;ll probably work most of the time, but some small percentage of the time, data may get lost passing between the expansion card and the motherboard. If that data is crucial, the PC may lock up.</P>
<p>What can Windows 2000 do about that? In other words, how can an operating system that wants to be stable work around an inherently unstable hardware platform? To a certain extent, there&#146;s nothing that the operating system can do, and some crashes are unavoidable. But some ISA boards are designed better than others, and only experimentation will separate the good from the bad. Further, the operating system can incorporate drivers for the hardware that are a bit more &#147;forgiving.&#148; By forgiving, we mean that the driver is built to <i>anticipate</I> a certain number of hardware errors and to simply step around them.</P>
<p>&#147;Aha!&#148; you cry. &#147;If they can make drivers &#145;forgiving,&#146; why don&#146;t they <i>always</I> do that?&#148; Well, for one thing, it&#146;s harder to write such drivers. For another, most driver authors resent writing drivers to support hardware that isn&#146;t really standard. Talk to them for a bit, and they start muttering about hitting moving targets and the like. Finally, and most important, adding forgiveness to a driver <i>slows it down</I>, and as all PC speed freaks know, slow is bad.</P>
<p>Again, what can you do about it? For one thing, stay as far away from ISA boards as you can. Yes, they&#146;re the most common and the cheapest boards, but there&#146;s usually a reason that cheap things are cheap.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Buy systems that have PCI slots (at least three slots) and use only PCI boards. Most of these systems also have ISA slots but don&#146;t use them. Multiprocessor systems usually have a combination of PCI and EISA slots; both of those are fine to use because both are truly standard interfaces.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI), Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA), and MicroChannel Architecture (MCA) buses were all designed by a central authority that published specifications, which, if followed, yield an expansion board that works predictably. That&#146;s why we strongly recommend staying with those three expansion slot types. In reality, however, you won&#146;t find many modern systems with the MCA bus; it&#146;s about dead. Again, you&#146;ll find EISA slots on many multiprocessor systems, but not many EISA expansion boards are on the market. PCI is becoming more and more widespread and almost unavoidable in new hardware; in our opinion, it&#146;s the way to go.
