<dt>Physical Topologies
<dt>Logical Topologies
<dt>IEEE&#146;s Topological Protocols
<dt>Peer-to-Peer vs. Client-Server
</DL>
<p><big><big>I</BIG></BIG>f you&#146;ve thoroughly digested your networking basics up to this point, you may have already decided which cabling system or systems to use for your network, which means now it&#146;s time to figure out how to put them and your computers together. The best way to approach this task is to delve more deeply into topologies, a topic we visited briefly in the preceding chapter but which we concentrate on in depth here. To refresh your memory, here&#146;s a quick overview of the main types of topologies:</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Physical topologies</B>
<dd>Describe how the computers connect to each other. You can think of a physical topology as an actual map of how your computers and cables might look in an aerial photograph. The physical topology includes the cables, connectors, NICs, and hubs. If it is a part of the network and you can tangibly touch it, it is part of the physical topology of your network.
<dt><b>Logical topologies</B>
<dd>Describe how signals pass between networked computers or how information passes from node A to node B. The same words (bus, ring) are used to describe specific physical and logical topologies, so be sure you understand the distinction.
</DL>

<p>After you&#146;ve mastered the various specific topologies available in each of the above two categories, we&#146;ll move bravely to the <i>protocols</I> that can be used for networking your computers. We make no bones about it: Protocols for sending information across your network are easily the most technically intensive part of this chapter. So make sure you block out an hour of your time to get through it and have a strong cup of coffee on hand. But we promise you, if you make it through this section of the chapter, the ride is all downhill from there.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Physical Topologies</FONT></H3>
<p>If you wanted to, you could conceivably run cables from each network node to all other network nodes. Technically, assuming that you had enough places to plug in all those cables, this configuration could work fine. The only real problem is the amount of cable you would use.
</P>
<p>If you draw a diagram for yourself, you can easily see how connecting all the computers in a network directly to each other could quickly get very complicated. For example, take a look at Figure 23.1. With 5 computers, you would need 10 cables, which doesn&#146;t seem too bad, really; but if you added just 3 more computers, you would have to connect 18 more cables! It gets worse: 10 computers require 45 cables; 25 computers require 300 cables.</P>

<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch23/images/23-01.jpg',450,834)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 23.1</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct-cabling requirements for a 5-node network and an 8-node network</P>
<p>To figure out how many cables your organization would need to interconnect all your computers this way, you can use the following calculation: Take the number of computers (<i>n</I>), multiply it by (<i>n</I>-1), and then divide the result by 2. Hence:</P>
<dl>
<dd>Number of cables = <i>n</I> (<i>n</I>-1) &#247; 2
</DL>
<p>As you can see, the amount of cable adds up pretty quickly. If you don&#146;t want to spend your entire budget on cable, therefore, you need to devise a more efficient way of linking your network nodes. Most networks use one of three physical topologies: the star, the bus, or the ring.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">Star Topology</FONT></H4>
<p>In the star topology, the network&#146;s server is the center of attention. Each workstation on the network connects directly to the server. Seen from above, a network with a star topology would look something like Figure 23.2.
</P>
<p><a name="Fig2"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch23/images/23-02.jpg',500,220)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch23/images/23-02t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch23/images/23-02.jpg',500,220)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 23.2</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Star physical topology</P>
<p>The very first data communications networks used a star topology. There wasn&#146;t any astrological significance to this design; it took advantage of the way that computers worked at the time. Remember that in the early days of computing, the mainframe was the preferred way of networking. Originally, people could get information from the mainframe only by punching cards, feeding them into the mainframe, and then waiting for their answer.
</P>
<p>Eventually, new technology produced the terminal, which was a slightly (but only slightly) more sophisticated way of doing the same thing. Each terminal connected to the mainframe separately, and because the terminals possessed no computing power, when they wanted information they contacted the mainframe. They still had to wait in line for the main computer to get to their question.</P>
<p>If the star topology is the product of the early days of computing, why is it still around today, when most new terminals have become smart workstations? The answer is threefold:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ease of transmission
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ease of troubleshooting
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ease of cabling
</DL>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading4"></A><font color="#000077">Getting to the Hub of the Problem</FONT></H4>
<p>The centerpiece of the star topology is a hub, a multistation access unit (MAU), or a concentrator. All three of these devices provide a centralized location where all the cables in your physical star meet. Any node that is connected to these devices can talk to any other node that is connected. Thus the similarity of these three devices, but how are they different?
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Hub</B></FONT></P>
<p>A <i>hub</I> is a device that provides a meeting location for all your cables. Any device attached to the hub has physical access to any other device that is connected to the hub. Hubs generally fall into one of two categories: passive or active.</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>Passive hub</B>
<dd>Provides a central location where all your cables meet; it provides no additional functions.
<dt><b>Active hub</B>
<dd>Provides a central location where all your cables meet as well as at least one other function. The other function can be acting as a repeater (which is the most common) or acting as a bridge or router.
</DL>

<p><font size="+1"><b>Multistation Access Units (MAUs)</B></FONT></P>
<p>IBM generally refers to its hubs as <i>multistation access units</I> (MAUs). MAUs serve the same functions as hubs and are used to accommodate the IBM connector. Most MAUs are active by design.</P><p><br></P>
