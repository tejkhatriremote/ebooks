<p>Not only did the IEEE 802.3 committee have to determine how information would travel through the network and the kind of cable and topology that would best suit the method of data travel, it had to determine how far the cables could stretch before the data faded or corrupted. The committee found that length to be 185 meters (607 feet) per cable segment. This length limitation clearly limits the distance that workstations can sit apart from each other and may affect the choice of network type in some situations.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Remember, the length issue is important because it determines how far away one workstation can be from another workstation or how closely the workstations have to be grouped together. If the workstations are too far apart, then the information will fade away or become corrupted in transit. To avoid this problem, welcome to the wonderful world of repeaters. Recall that a repeater is simply a device that is placed periodically throughout the network to enhance or to strengthen the signal. As the signal reaches its length threshold, a repeater gives the signal a boost so that it can be sent another set distance before it hits the workstation that is to receive the information, or before another repeater needs to enhance the signal again.<hr></FONT>

<p><font size="+1"><b>Carrier-Sensing Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)</B></FONT></P>
<p>The 802.3 standard&#146;s most salient feature is the <i>carrier-sensing multiple access with collision detection</I> (CSMA/CD) designation. Carrier-sensing multiple access with collision detection (quite a mouthful, eh?) gets to the heart of a basic Ethernet problem: How can you send vast amounts of information simultaneously across the network without causing collisions? After all, the network can handle only one packet at a time.</P>
<p>The best way to understand why Ethernet needs CSMA/CD is to visualize the boulder warehouse again from Chapter 22. Recall how each clerk sat alone in a room with a boulder the size of the one in <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</I>. The halls of this warehouse are pretty narrow, so the boulders only just fit&#151;there&#146;s certainly no room for two to pass each other. Before the clerks can move the boulders, they have to listen outside their doors to make sure that no one else is moving a boulder in the corridor. Because the clerks have to move the boulders around fairly often, they spend a lot of time listening and then leaping out the door as soon as it&#146;s quiet&#151;which, of course, leads to collisions because all the other clerks are doing the same thing. When the boulders collide, each clerk has to go back to his storeroom and wait for quiet before trying again.</P>
<p>Your Ethernet LAN works in much the same way. If you send one packet of information from one workstation to another workstation, the network has no trouble controlling the flow of this packet. If more than one workstation tries to broadcast at the same time, however, the packets will collide, the transmission will abort, and the workstations will have to try transmitting again.</P>
<p>CSMA/CD provides a means for reducing packet collision. Before transmitting, CSMA/CD broadcasts a signal known as the <i>carrier-sensing signal</I> to see if any other workstations are broadcasting. If not, it gives the workstation the &#147;all clear,&#148; and the workstation transmits its packet. If, however, the carrier-sensing signal (as shown in Figure 23.8) detects another workstation&#146;s transmittal, CSMA/CD tells the workstation to wait before broadcasting.</P>

<p>This process works fine so long as network traffic isn&#146;t heavy and the LAN&#146;s cables aren&#146;t any longer than they&#146;re rated for. If either of those conditions exist, then collisions are likely to happen regardless of CSMA/CD. CSMA/CD isn&#146;t in charge of making sure that only one workstation transmits at a time; it&#146;s in charge of making sure that all workstations are quiet before one transmits. If two workstations happen to <i>begin</I> transmitting at the same time, there&#146;s nothing that CSMA/CD can do to avoid the collision.</P>
<p>If two packets collide, CSMA/CD tries to avoid a repeat collision, as shown in Figure 23.9. As we discussed earlier, each workstation chooses a random number between 1 and 2 before transmitting again. If the workstations choose the same number, they each choose a number between 1 and 4 and try again. This process goes on until either the workstations have both successfully completed their transmissions or they&#146;ve tried 16 times without success. If they flunk out by the 16th try, both workstations have to pause and give the other workstations a chance to transmit.</P>

<p>In short, CSMA/CD can&#146;t prevent every collision but it tries to minimize the time that collisions tie up the network.
</P>
<p>Another Ethernet protocol called 802.2 is a variation on this theme. People use 802.3 primarily in a Novell environment because it is faster than 802.2. However, 802.3 is proprietary to the IPX protocol from Novell. In a heterogeneous environment with different types of servers and network operating systems, 802.2 is preferred because it is more universal in nature.</P><p><br></P>
