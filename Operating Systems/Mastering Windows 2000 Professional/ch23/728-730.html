<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading13"></A><font color="#000077">The 802.4 Standard</FONT></H4>
<p>In an effort to design a standard that was less prone to collisions than the 802.3, the IEEE 802.4 subcommittee designed a combination bus/ring topology that transmitted information via a token. Using the bus physical topology and the ring logical topology, the 802.4 standard is designed on the principle that computers are prone to the same fallibility as humans: Give &#146;em half a chance, and they&#146;ll talk right on top of each other. To get around this problem, the 802.4 committee designed a token that the network could use in much the same way that discussion groups use &#147;talking sticks&#148;&#151;whoever&#146;s got the stick has the floor (usually for a preset period of time) and no one else can talk until they&#146;ve got the stick. So it is with the 802.4 standard.
</P>
<p>Only the workstation that has the token can send information, and after that workstation has received acknowledgment of the receipt of that information, it must then pass the token to the next workstation in line. How does the network determine who&#146;s next in line? In the 802.4 standard, the network keeps track of who gets the token next. Just as the business manager could get the talking stick more often than the person in charge of office decorations, it&#146;s possible for some workstations to have priority over others to get the token.</P>
<p>The method of controlling collisions isn&#146;t the only way in which the 802.4 standard differs from the 802.3 standard. An 802.4 packet looks different than an 802.3 packet. The 802.4 contains a preamble, a start frame delimiter, frame control, destination address, source address, information, frame check sequence, and frame delimiter, as shown in Figure 23.10.</P>

<p>Although the token bus combination avoids collisions, the 802.4 standard still has some disadvantages that have kept it from common usage. Most shortfalls of the token bus format come from malfunctioning hardware, which can result in the token being lost, or shadowed tokens that make it look as though the network has multiple tokens. Imagine a board meeting with more than one talking stick!
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading14"></A><font color="#000077">The 802.5 Standard</FONT></H4>
<p>The IEEE 802.5 committee developed the 802.5 standard in conjunction with IBM. This standard is specifically designed for Token Ring networks that use the token specification to pass information from one workstation to another. As you&#146;ll remember from our earlier discussion of the Token Ring LAN, the 802.5 standard uses a star physical topology and a ring logical topology.
</P>
<p>As in the 802.4 standard, the workstations on a Token Ring network use a token to determine which workstation gets to transmit. If a workstation doesn&#146;t need to transmit anything, it passes the free token to the next workstation, and so on until a workstation needs to transmit something.</P>
<p>Data travels from the originating workstation to every node on the network in succession. Each workstation examines the address on the data packet. If the data is for that station, the workstation keeps a copy of the data and sends the original on. If the data isn&#146;t for that station, it merely sends it to the next workstation on the network. When the sending workstation gets back the copy of its first data packet, it knows that it&#146;s time to stop transmitting and passes the free token to the next workstation.</P>
<p>The 802.5 standard has some qualities to recommend it. With a smart hub, the Token Ring protocol also allows for malfunctioning hardware&#151;a nice feature that the token bus standard doesn&#146;t have. If a workstation malfunctions, either not releasing the token when its turn is up or jabbering over the network, the smart hub can recognize trouble and cut that workstation from the LAN, enabling the rest of the network to function normally. An 802.5 network can also extend for longer distances than either the 802.3 or the 802.4 because the packet travels from one workstation to another, retransmitted at every step, and so it never has very far to go before being retransmitted.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading15"></A><font color="#000077">Peer-to-Peer vs. Client-Server</FONT></H3>
<p>In the computing world, some issues are so divisive that debates about them have something of the quality of religious argument. If you don&#146;t believe us, have you ever eavesdropped on an argument between a diehard Mac user and a PC aficionado?
</P>
<p>To date, the peer-to-peer vs. client-server debate hasn&#146;t reached this point of passion, but some people <i>really</I> believe in one or the other, sometimes for no other reason than one technology is the first that they ever encountered. If you&#146;d like to take a slightly more intellectual look at the debate, read on.</P>
<p>Neither type of network is perfect for all situations. Client-server networks have better security whereas peer-to-peer networks are more flexible and are often cheaper. Windows 2000 supports both platforms, with Windows 2000 Professional primarily providing peer-to-peer networking capabilities and Windows 2000 Server providing both.</P><p><br></P>
