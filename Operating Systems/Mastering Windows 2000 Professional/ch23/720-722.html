<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading9"></A><font color="#000077">Token Ring Topology</FONT></H4>
<p>IBM originally bought the design for the Token Ring logical topology from Olaf Soderblom, a Dutch scientist. The original Token Ring used a 4Mbps signaling speed, but in 1989 IBM released a 16Mbps version. Other Token Ring networks are available but they are not as well known as IBM&#146;s, partially because they were late getting on the market. In addition, other companies developing their own Token Ring systems have to decide whether to fight or accommodate Soderblom&#146;s claim of proprietary rights. At this point, the battle is still in progress.
</P>
<p>Although the Token Ring network has a ring logical topology, it uses a connected star system like that of 10BaseT Ethernet for its physical topology. Instead of hubs, Token Ring uses devices called either concentrators or, more commonly, multistation access units (MAUs), as first discussed in Chapter 22. Don&#146;t confuse these MAUs with an Ethernet adapter&#146;s <i>media attachment unit</I>&#151;a transceiver connecting to the Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) port.</P>
<p>A Token Ring board attaches to the MAU with a D-shell type connector on one side and an odd-looking IBM connector on the other. The Token Ring connector plugs into the MAU. Eight PCs can attach to a MAU, and then those MAUs attach to <i>other</I> MAUs. Token Ring networks do not have terminators; instead, one end of the cable plugs into the board and the other end plugs into the MAU.</P>
<p>As with the hubs for 10BaseT, you can most easily arrange your Token Ring network so that cables extend from a central wiring closet (a place where all the cables can be gathered together) on each floor to workstations on that floor, and the MAUs go into the wiring closet. The cables between the MAU and the network device can be up to 45 meters long, providing enough space for most floor plans to be cabled with a wiring closet.</P>
<p>Remember that Ethernet is a broadcast system; that is, what one station says, all stations hear. But Token Ring doesn&#146;t work that way. In Token Ring, every station must repeat what it hears from the previous station, making a kind of &#147;bucket brigade&#148; of data.</P>
<p>The heart of the Token Ring topology is the token packet. To avoid packet collisions, the token topologies ensure that only one workstation can send information across the network at any given time. The method used to ensure that only a single transmission occurs is the token packet or &#147;talking stick.&#148; Only the node that has control of the token packet can send information across the network.</P>
<p>How does the token move around the network? When a workstation is done with the token, it releases it to whatever station is next in line. If nobody grabs the token, the workstation releases it a second time. If nobody responds to the token for a second time, then the workstation sends out a general query, known as a <i>solicit successor frame</I>, over the network, asking, &#147;Who&#146;s supposed to get the token next?&#148; If a workstation responds, the sending workstation addresses the token to that workstation and passes the token. Because no single node can transmit for longer than it takes for a piece of data to make a complete circuit of the network, no one ever waits more than one circuit&#146;s worth of information before getting a chance to transmit. Unlike Ethernet, where collisions could conceivably keep other nodes from transmitting by tying up the network, Token Ring ensures that everyone gets a turn.</P>
<p>The fact that <i>Ethernet broadcasts</I> and that <i>Token Ring repeats</I> affects the kinds of cable that each network topology uses. Fiber-optic lines are not well suited to broadcasting but work well for point-to-point communications. Consequently, Token Ring is better suited to fiber usage than Ethernet is unless you use some kind of star configuration such as 10BaseT Ethernet. Token Ring is designed to support a variety of cable types, but most commonly uses IBM Type 1, IBM Type 2, and IBM Type 3 cables.</P>
<p>What is the bottom line on Token Ring? It&#146;s more expensive than Ethernet, but it has a more sophisticated problem detection and recovery apparatus than Ethernet does. (In English, that means that Token Ring is the easier topology to troubleshoot.) For larger networks, then, Token Ring is sometimes the better choice if you can afford it. The more stations you have, the more likely it is that one will malfunction, and it&#146;s a lot easier to troubleshoot Token Ring (or have it troubleshoot itself) than to troubleshoot the bus network. Token Ring also has historically been viewed as faster than Ethernet. So if speed of access is your focus, choose Token Ring even though it is more expensive. With the advent of 100BaseT Ethernet technologies, this decision seems to have swung back to Ethernet&#146;s favor.</P><p><br></P>
