<p>The bus topology, known in the Mac world by the more descriptive term <i>daisy chaining</I>, is much more cable efficient than the star topology. In the bus topology, the cable runs from computer to computer, making each computer a link of a chain. You can run a bus topology in three ways. Ethernet is the best-known example of a logical bus topology; the others are called Thicknet (10Base5) and Thinnet (10Base2) respectively, based on the type of cable that you use to connect the network.</P>
<p><i>Thicknet</I>, sometimes referred to as <i>frozen yellow garden hose</I> because of its stiffness and color, uses a thick, central cable as a sort of backbone for the network; then from the backbone it runs thinner cables known as <i>taps</I> or <i>drops</I> to the network&#146;s nodes, as depicted in Figure 23.3. What connects the thinner cable to the Thicknet cable is a transceiver. In generic terms, a <i>transceiver</I> is a device that connects one cable type to a dissimilar cable type.</P>

<p>The <i>T&#146;</I>s at either end of the network in Figure 23.3 indicate the terminators.</P>
<p>The Thicknet configuration is typically used in mainframe and minicomputer networks, but its popularity is diminishing as PCs get smarter and mainframe-based networks less common.</P>
<p><i>Thinnet</I>, on the other hand, eschews the backbone idea and connects all network devices directly. Rather than using thick cable, Thinnet uses the more flexible coaxial cable, as depicted in Figure 23.4. Thinnet is becoming a more popular networking topology than its thick counterpart, if for no other reason than that the thick cable in Thicknet is a pain to work with&#151;it&#146;s very stiff and clumsy.</P>

<p>The biggest potential problem with a bus network is that you have to tell it when to quit. If you haven&#146;t terminated your network, then your network can&#146;t transmit. Nor can it transmit if even one node on the network is malfunctioning, because the system depends on every node being in proper working order so that it can pass the data along.
</P>
<p>Note the important distinction between a node malfunctioning and a node being off. If the node is off, then data will pass through the T connector to the next active node. In this case, the network is unaware that an inactive node is present. However, if the node is on, or active&#151;but malfunctioning&#151;then problems will occur. The active node will still attempt to process a packet, but will do it inaccurately, thus slowing down the whole network or bringing it to a screeching halt.</P>
<p>The bus topology does have one great advantage over the star topology: It&#146;s cable efficient and therefore can save you money on the most expensive part of your network. On the other hand, it can be difficult to implement if your network is not neatly lined up in a row. As we discussed in the section on the star topology, if the network is spread haphazardly over a building, running individual cables from each node to a hub could be a lot easier than trying to connect all the nodes to each other.</P>
<p>Another big minus to the bus is troubleshooting. If <i>one node</I> is down, the network can&#146;t relay messages and the network stops dead. This factor not only makes your network vulnerable to failures (remember, the only way an entire star network dies is if the server or hub dies), but also makes it difficult to troubleshoot. To find a problem on a bus network, you might need to inspect every node on the segment to make sure that the cables are securely fastened, that no one tried to reboot or log off when a signal was being passed, or that any number of other things are in order.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading7"></A><font color="#000077">Logical Topologies</FONT></H3>
<p>Logical topologies (occasionally referred to as <i>electrical topologies</I>) describe the way in which a network transmits information from one node to the next node&#151;as opposed to physical topologies, which merely represent what your network looks like. This topic is not all theory, however; the way you want your network to transmit information can directly affect your options when it comes to purchasing Network Interface Cards and cabling.</P>
<p>As we head into logical topology, remember that the physical topology does not have a direct bearing on the logical topology. You can have a physical bus and a logical ring, a physical star and a logical bus, and so on.</P>
<p>The best way to visualize a logical topology is by way of an analogy. If you had a 400-page document that absolutely, positively had to be to sent across the country overnight, you would probably send it via Federal Express. In the process of sending this document, you would have to use a FedEx envelope and addressing slip. When addressing the FedEx package, you would have to provide a source address, destination address, and the document.</P>
<p>Your network needs the same pieces of information: source address, destination address, and data. All this information taken together comprises the <i>packet</I>. The logical topology has to handle how this packet is going to be sent across the network. It&#146;s a three-step process:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The logical topology determines the format of the packet, just as FedEx has predetermined the format of its address slip. You must have the addresses in a certain format.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The logical topology determines how much information the packet will carry, just as FedEx says that only 20 pages can be sent in its letter envelope.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The logical topology determines the method of tracking the packet across the network.
</DL>
<p>Actually, in regard to step 3 of the process, some logical topologies do not track the packet at all; they just hope for the best. Other topologies track the packet along each step of its path.
