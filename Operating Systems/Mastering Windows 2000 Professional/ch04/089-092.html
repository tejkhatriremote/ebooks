<p><big><big>I</BIG></BIG>n this chapter, we discuss properties sheets in more detail. Also, because one of the easiest ways of revealing an object&#146;s properties is via a right-click of your mouse, we present a comprehensive summary of the other things you can do with a right-click to get your work done faster. You&#146;ve already had the opportunity to use these features in earlier chapters. This time around, though, we get into the essentials. Let&#146;s start with a brief recap of right-clicking.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Right-Clicking around Windows 2000</FONT></H3>
<p>Right-clicking objects throughout the Windows 2000 interface brings up a shortcut menu with options pertaining to the objects at hand. The same options are typically available from the main menus but are more conveniently reached with the right-click.
</P>
<p>The &#147;rightness&#148; and &#147;leftness&#148; of these clicks will, of course, be reversed if you have reversed the mouse buttons (because you&#146;re left-handed, for example, or for some other reason). If you have a trackball, a GlidePoint, or another non-mouse pointing device, your right-click button may be somewhere unexpected. You may need to refer to your pointing device&#146;s Help files to find out how to trigger the right-click event. In addition, if you have a special Windows 95/NT keyboard, there is a special &#147;right menu&#148; key (next to the Windows key) that you can press to trigger the right-click for whatever screen object has the current focus.</P>
<p>Right-clicking doesn&#146;t belong only to the Windows 9<i>x</I> and Windows 2000 interface&#151;it has been incorporated into recently written Windows programs, too. For example, Microsoft Office programs such as Word and Excel have had right-click menus for some time. Most of the accessory programs supplied with Windows 2000 have context-sensitive right-click menus, too. In general, the contents of the right-click menus change depending on the type of object. An option for a table differs from those for spreadsheet cells, frames, text, graphics, and so on.</P>
<p>As a rule, we suggest you start using the right-click button whenever you can. You&#146;ll learn through experimentation which of your programs do something with the right-click and which don&#146;t. Many NT 3.51 (and 16-bit Windows) programs won&#146;t respond to the click; others may do something unexpected, but in almost every case, right-clicking results in a pop-up menu. Incidentally, as with any menu in Windows, you can close the pop-up menu by clicking elsewhere or by pressing Esc, so don&#146;t worry about doing anything dangerous or irreversible.</P>
<p>A good example of a right-clickable item is the Taskbar. Right-click an empty place on the Taskbar, and you&#146;ll see this menu:</P>
<p><a name="Fig1"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch04/images/04-01.jpg',165,178)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch04/images/04-01t.jpg"></A></P>
<p>Now right-click the Start button and you&#146;ll see the following menu:
</P>
<p><a name="Fig2"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch04/images/04-02.jpg',124,100)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch04/images/04-02t.jpg"></A></P>
<p>Other right-click menus often have Cut, Copy, Paste, Open, Print, and Rename choices on them. Here are a few other right-clicking experiments to give you a feel for the usefulness of this facility:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-click My Computer and notice the menu options. You&#146;ll see different right-click menus depending on whether you right-click the My Computer icon on the Desktop or whether you right-click the My Computer window after it&#146;s open. In fact, you&#146;ll get different right-click menus within the open window depending on which part of the window you click&#151;for example, the title bar, the list area of the window, and an object highlighted within the list will each pop up a different right-click menu.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you right-click a printer in the Printers folder, you can quickly set the printer to be the default printer or to work offline. Printing offline is handy when the printer you want to use is not connected (or is turned off), because the result of offline printing is that your print jobs are queued up, ready and waiting until your printer is reconnected and ready to print. To begin printing again, simply right-click the printer and select Work Online, and all the print jobs in your queue are sent to the printer. (Work Offline and Work Online appear on a printer&#146;s right-click menu only if the printer is located on a network.)
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-click the Desktop to see options for setting the screen colors, wallpaper, screen saver, and so forth. This also lets you set the Active Desktop options for displaying Web content on your Desktop.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-click any program&#146;s title bar and notice the options for resizing the window or closing the application. This menu is the same as the program&#146;s System menu.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-click a minimized program&#146;s button in the Taskbar. This gives the same result as clicking the same program&#146;s title bar: It pops up the program&#146;s System menu, which offers options for restoring the application (i.e., restoring it to its former size and position on the Desktop), resizing the application window, or closing the application.

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>In NT 4, there is a command on many context menus called QuickView. QuickView enable you to quickly view the file without opening it in an application. In Windows 2000, this functionality is embedded in Windows Explorer. When you click on a file, if there is a QuickView capability you&#146;ll see the file displayed just to the left of the files and folders in the right pane of Windows Explorer.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Many objects such as folders, printers, and My Network Places have a right-click menu called Explore that brings up the item in Explorer&#146;s format (two vertical panes). This is a super-handy way to check out the object in a display similar to the NT 3.<i>x</I>/Windows 3.<i>x</I> File Manager. You&#146;ll have the object in the left pane and its contents listed in the right pane. In some cases, the contents are print jobs; in other cases, they are fonts, files, folders, disk drives, or computers on the network. Windows Explorer is covered in Chapter 3, &#147;Organizing Programs and Documents.&#148;</P>
<p>Sharable items, such as printers, hard disks, and fax modems have a Sharing option on their right-click menu. The resulting box lets you declare how an object is shared by other users on the network. Sharing a printer is covered in Chapter 8, &#147;Sharing Data between Applications,&#148; and those general rules apply here. Additional discussion of sharing is found in Part V of this book.</P><p><br></P>
