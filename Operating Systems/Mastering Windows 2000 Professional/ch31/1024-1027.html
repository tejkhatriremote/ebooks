<h3><a name="Heading10"></A><font color="#000077">The Recycle Bin&#146;s Properties</FONT></H3>
<p>Recall that when you delete files, they aren&#146;t actually erased (unless you remembered to press the Shift key at the same time as the Delete key when you deleted them). They get moved to the Recycle Bin, which is a directory on your hard disk. If your hard disk is modest in size or is getting crammed, decreasing the size of the Recycle Bin might be in order. If you decrease its size, though, remember that you&#146;ll be cutting down on the number (and/or the size) of the files that can be recovered. In some cases, you might even want to increase the size of the Recycle Bin to keep yourself from worrying about whether you&#146;re making the right decision when clearing off certain projects (for instance, if you&#146;ve ever worked for clients who change their mind after giving their &#147;final&#148; instructions). The options in the Recycle Bin&#146;s properties sheet are therefore worth a look.
</P>
<p>To get to the properties sheet, right-click the Recycle Bin icon, either on the Desktop or in Explorer, and then choose Properties. The Recycle Bin settings appear as shown in Figure 31.17.</P>
<p><a name="Fig19"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch31/images/31-19.jpg',344,400)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch31/images/31-19t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch31/images/31-19.jpg',344,400)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 31.17</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can set specifics of the Recycle Bin&#146;s behavior from its properties sheet.</P>
<p>There are a number of settings here to contemplate. First, notice that in addition to a Global tab, there is also a tab for each of your local hard disks. If you choose Configure Drives Independently on the Global page, you&#146;ll have to go to each tab as needed to make individual drive settings. Otherwise you can just use the Global page.
</P>
<p>If you don&#146;t want to be able to reclaim deleted files, check the Do Not Move Files to the Recycle Bin option. Why would you do this? For one thing, it speeds up the deletion process. For another, it frees up disk space immediately on deletion. Finally, if you&#146;re paranoid that someone else is going to access your system and expose your old mistakes, it destroys the evidence.</P>
<p>As a default, 10 percent of each drive is used for the Recycle Bin. When you delete a file on drive C, it goes to drive C&#146;s Recycle Bin until you empty the Bin. When you delete from drive D (if you have a second hard drive), it goes into drive D&#146;s Recycle Bin. As a Recycle Bin reaches capacity, newly deleted files will push older files off the bottom of the list, deleting them permanently. In practical terms, the Recycle Bin&#146;s size determines how long a file will be recoverable before it&#146;s pushed off the list.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The size of a drive&#146;s Recycle Bin unfortunately limits the size of the largest file that can be recovered after an accidental deletion. If a file is larger than the maximum size of the Recycle Bin, then it won&#146;t be recyclable. As of this writing, you won&#146;t be warned of this either; it will just be erased.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>If you want to alter the size of your Recycle Bins, use the percentage slider. Usually, the default of 10 percent works just fine, but if you work with very large files, you may want to increase this percentage to accommodate them. If you&#146;re short on disk space and don&#146;t tend to make deletion mistakes, decrease it.
</P>
<p>The last check box in the Recycle Bin properties sheet, Display Delete Confirmation Dialog, is normally checked so that you can confirm before Windows 2000 will empty the bin. If you find the confirmation boxes annoying, turn off this check box.</P>
<p>Here are a few other points you might want to keep in mind concerning the Recycle Bin in Windows 2000:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you delete a folder, only the files within that folder appear in the Recycle Bin&#151;the folder itself will not appear. However, if you restore a file that was originally located in a deleted folder, Windows 2000 recreates the folder and then restores the file to it.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 2000 maintains separate Recycle Bins for each user on an NTFS partition. If you use Explorer to list the folders on an NTFS drive, you will find a folder called the Recycler. The Recycler contains individual Recycle Bins for each user that has logged onto the computer list by the Security ID of the user.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you empty the Recycle Bin, <i>all</I> the bins are flushed. You can&#146;t empty them on a drive-by-drive basis unless you use a file-management program other than Explorer, such as the old Windows File Manager (which at last report was still shipping in Windows 2000&#151;to run File Manager, click Start <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch31/images/31-01i.jpg"> Run and type <b>winfile</B>). You <i>can</I> use Explorer to delete specific files from the Recycle Bin if you select and delete the files individually, however.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you delete files via the command prompt (typing <b>del</B> or <b>erase</B>), these files <i>are</I> immediately erased. If you ever need to restore these files (or files deleted from the Recycle Bin), there are third-party tools available that will work with Windows 2000, but Windows 2000 itself provides no such means of &#147;undeleting&#148; files that were deleted via a DOS command.
