<h3><a name="Heading11"></A><font color="#000077">The Management Console</FONT></H3>
<p>We&#146;ve spent a lot of time in this book referring to the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), it seems like a good idea to look at this new tool a little closer. The MMC is the answer to a common complaint in Windows NT, namely &#147;Why can&#146;t we have one tool to do all of our administration?&#148; Well, someone at Microsoft was listening, though whether this turns out to be a good solution remains to be seen.
</P>
<p>You can get to the MMC in a variety of ways. The easiest way, if you just want to look at the tool itself, is to use the Run command and type in <b>mmc</B>. This opens an empty console. This brings up the question, empty of what? Well, the MMC normally contains things called <i>snap-ins</I>, which enable you to actually <i>do</I> some work with Windows 2000. The basic MMC is shown in Figure 31.18.</P>
<p><a name="Fig20"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch31/images/31-20.jpg',600,411)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch31/images/31-20t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch31/images/31-20.jpg',600,411)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 31.18</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Microsoft Management Console</P>
<p>To add a snap-in to the MMC use the following steps:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the MMC by clicking the Start button and selecting Run. Type <b>mmc</B>, and click OK.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Console menu select Add/Remove Snap-in. This will open the Add/ Remove Snap-in dialog box. Click Add.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the snap-in you want to load from the list, and then click the Add button.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;To add additional snap-ins, repeat steps 2 and 3 as many times as necessary.
</DL>
<p>If you need help when using any snap-in in the MMC, click the Action menu and select the Help command.
</P>
<p>So, what happens if you&#146;ve gone through all the trouble to really customize the snap-ins in the MMC and then you close it? Do you lose all of your work? Not if you save the settings when you exit. To save your workspace in the MMC, click the Console menu and select Save As. You will be prompted to provide a name for the saved file. All saved MMC files end with a <tt>.msc</TT> extension.</P>
<p>You can also open your saved MMC files from the command prompt using the following syntax:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<pre>
   MMC <i>path\filename</I> /a /s
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<p>The syntax is defined as follows:
</P>
<dl>
<dt><b>MMC</B>
<dd>The command to open the Microsoft Management Console.
<dt><b><i>path\filename</I>
</B>
<dd>Defines the path to the saved MMC file and its name.
<dt><b>/a</B>
<dd>Opens the console in Author mode. This will enable you to add or remove snap-ins from the saved console. This doesn&#146;t change the default mode for the file, it simply overrides it for one session.
<dt><b>/s</B>
<dd>Prevents the display of the splash screen. This switch is a holdover from the first version of the MMC, which would display a splash screen every time it opened. This switch is not necessary in Windows 2000.
</DL>

<p>The MMC can be used to monitor both locally and remotely. If you choose to open a saved MMC file for a remote computer, you do it the same way. Simply enter the path to the remote .msc file at a command prompt and press enter. You must have network connectivity to the remote computer as well as the necessary permissions to run the MMC on that computer.

<h3><a name="Heading12"></A><font color="#000077">Final Suggestions</FONT></H3>
<p>In Chapter 27, &#147;Supporting New Hardware and Installing Drivers,&#148; and Chapter 28, &#147;Running Windows 3.<i>x</I> and DOS Programs,&#148; we touched on some basic Windows 2000 software and hardware compatibility issues, some of which affect system throughput and overall performance. Although Windows 2000 Professional has evolved through many changes and improvements, unfortunately a genie in a bottle isn&#146;t included. The old tried-and-true performance essentials are still applicable. We could write a hundred pages about keeping your hardware doodads up to snuff, your hard disk organized, and other tricks for squeezing the most out of every CPU cycle. But in the end, most people don&#146;t bother, and it doesn&#146;t really net you much. In reality only a few truly beneficial performance tricks are worth the hassle or price:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;First off, always keep a lot of free space available on your hard disk. This is essential. You should have at least 200MB (some people say as much as 500MB) free on your disk for use by Windows for virtual memory. If you have too little, you&#146;ll start getting messages about running out of memory when you try to switch between programs. If you use only a few small programs at a time, this is less of an issue.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are unhappy with the performance of your system and it&#146;s a pretty fast Pentium II-level system already, then increase the amount of RAM. Most Pentium computers today come with 64MB. You will find that 128MB (or more!) will dramatically improve things.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don&#146;t have a local-bus hard-disk controller, switch to one. SCSI III is best; IDE on the VLB or PCI bus is good. You may be able to keep your existing drive, but make sure it&#146;s large enough and has a fast step rate (12 milliseconds or lower).
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your video controller should be on the local bus too. If you can live with only 16 colors, use the Display applet in Control Panel to reduce the colors. Screen redrawing will usually speed up significantly.
</DL>
<h3><a name="Heading13"></A><font color="#000077">Summary</FONT></H3>
<p>In this chapter, we talked about some of Windows 2000&#146;s other configuration settings, the ones that don&#146;t seem to fit elsewhere in our discussions. We explored setting keyboard options and regional settings. We looked at system settings such as performance, startup and shutdown, hardware profiles, and user profiles. We then went on to discuss the Recycle Bin&#146;s configuration and use, and then finished by making some general performance recommendations.
