<p><big><big>T</BIG></BIG>he best-laid plans of mice and men oft gang a-gley, as the saying goes. And so, despite the tens of thousands of work hours invested in designing and coding Windows 2000 to make intelligent use of your system&#146;s hardware, not every scenario could possibly be foreseen. Now that Windows 2000 includes the simplicity of Plug and Play, configuring and troubleshooting the system is much easier than before. Clearly, much thought has gone into reducing the perceived complexity of the operating system. Still, as we all know, human intervention can be highly advantageous at times. If you&#146;re a systems administrator, computer jock, or power user, and you haven&#146;t found the options you need discussed elsewhere in this book, check out this chapter&#151;we&#146;ve gathered all the rest of the customization and optimization options here.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Keyboard Options</FONT></H3>
<p>Without modifying anything via the Control Panel&#146;s Keyboard applet, your keyboard will likely work just fine. But you might want to see what you&#146;re missing. Check out this applet&#146;s settings (see Figure 31.1) for changing several behavioral characteristics of your keyboard&#151; you might never go back to the defaults.
</P>
<p><a name="Fig1"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch31/images/31-01.jpg',404,478)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch31/images/31-01t.jpg"></A>

<p>On the Speed tab, the first setting you&#146;ll want to fiddle with is the Repeat Delay setting. This setting determines how long you have to hold down a key before it starts repeating. If you tend to hesitate more than the average typist and you find your screen responding with <i>tthhee</I> instead of <i>the</I>, you should lengthen the repeat delay.</P>
<p>The Repeat Rate controls the rate at which characters appear on your screen after you press the keys on your keyboard. Most keys repeat on screen when you hold them down for a while, but this setting also controls the rate at which the spacebar, arrow keys, PgUp, and PgDn keys work as well. To alter the default setting, simply drag the slider to a faster or slower setting. You can test the effect of a given setting by clicking in the test box and holding down a letter key. If the setting is too slow or fast, adjust and try again.</P>
<p>At the bottom of the Speed tab, you can change the cursor blink rate. This setting determines how fast the insertion point (or <i>I-beam</I>) blinks when you&#146;re editing text. Changing this to too slow a setting can cause the cursor to vanish for too long. Too fast, on the other hand, can be annoying. Drag the speed slider, then click in the test area to observe the effect.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">Multiple Keyboard-Layout and Keyboard-Language Support</FONT></H4>
<p>Because of differences in language and alphabet, computers marketed abroad have different key assignments from the standard American business computer. Key assignments in Windows 2000 for special characters such as accented characters, umlauts, and the like are determined by choices you can make on the Keyboard applet&#146;s Input Locales tab. During installation of Windows 2000, you&#146;re asked to confirm the language that Setup has assumed is correct for your location, so typically this will already be correct. If your line of work calls for text in several languages, you can install any number of language drivers into your system and switch them as quickly as you need them. Clicking the Taskbar or pressing a key is all you need to do to switch from one driver (and thus keyboard layout) to another.
</P>
<p>Typically you&#146;ll have only one driver showing when you open the Input Locales dialog. To add a new driver, click Add and choose a language from the resulting list. You may be prompted to insert a disk or CD-ROM so the applet can locate the proper driver. Then you&#146;ll have a second listing in the Installed Languages box, shown below.</P>
<p><a name="Fig2"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch31/images/31-02.jpg',404,478)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch31/images/31-02t.jpg"></A></P>
<p>Once set to another language, some keys (shifted and unshifted) will type letters that are different from those printed on your keyboard. Unfortunately, you&#146;ll have to experiment a bit to determine where your new keys are&#151;Windows 2000 doesn&#146;t include a utility that will display a keyboard map for each language driver.
</P>
<p>If you check Enable Indicator on the Taskbar, your Taskbar will indicate which language driver is active at any one time. Clicking the indicator in the System Tray brings up a menu that lets you easily switch between languages.</P>
<p>If you want to become super efficient at switching between installed languages, just activate either the left Alt&#43;Shift or Ctrl&#43;Shift option. With one of these options enabled, simply pressing that key combination toggles between languages.</P>
<p>If you want to remove a language/locale driver, select it in the dialog box and click Remove. Likewise, setting the default language is as easy as clicking Set as Default. This determines which language will be used when you start up your computer.</P>
<p>Note that it is possible, using the Properties button, to change a locale&#146;s keyboard layout without changing the corresponding Input Locale. In most cases, however, you will want to keep the keyboard layout the same as the Language/Locale setting.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Are you tired of the plain-old QWERTY layout? Think it could be holding you back? If you&#146;re willing to learn a new keyboard layout, try one of the <i>Dvorak</I> layouts, which are scientifically designed to increase the efficiency of your keystrokes. Normal, left-handed, and right-handed Dvorak layouts can be installed easily via the Properties button in the Keyboard Layouts list.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading4"></A><font color="#000077">Hardware Settings</FONT></H4>
<p>Finally, on the last tab, you&#146;ll find the Hardware settings. Here you set the actual hardware driver that Windows 2000 should use with your keyboard. We say <i>actual hardware driver</I> to distinguish from keyboard layout or language drivers that will be produced when you&#146;ve switched to another locale or language. Some keyboard brands require a special driver or have additional keys on them, such as number pads and the like. During Windows 2000 Setup, your keyboard was probably recognized and the correct driver installed. Should you later connect a different keyboard and it seems to be acting squirrelly after you plug it in, you should go to this tab and click the Change button. Your keyboard will then be checked for compatibility, and you&#146;ll have the option of installing a different type of driver. Click Change and then Show All Devices to see a list of all the possible keyboard hardware drivers.</P><p><br></P>
