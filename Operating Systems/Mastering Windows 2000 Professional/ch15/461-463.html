<p><i>Receiving</I> text files sent from the other computer is easy: You just use the Capture command described in the previous section. When you&#146;re connected to a BBS or information service, you first have to type whatever commands are needed to get the other computer to send you the file you want.</P>
<p>It&#146;s convenient to <i>send</I> short messages by typing them on your keyboard, but obviously this would be an inefficient way to send larger quantities of text. HyperTerminal gives you an alternative: You can send documents already prepared by a word processor or other program and stored on disk. By composing your messages first with a word processor or text editor, you can drastically reduce the connection time (and resultant cost). And it&#146;s much easier than typing them using the primitive editing features of HyperTerminal.</P>
<p>There are two ways to transfer data. One method uses error correction to ensure that the other computer receives your file without any loss of data; it also enables you to transfer complete documents. This is discussed in the following &#147;Sending and Receiving Documents and Other Files&#148; section. The other technique does not use error correction and can send <i>only</I> text, but it is compatible with a wider variety of computers.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>You cannot use the Send Text File command to send formatted documents or to send programs. Send such files as binary files as described in the &#147;Sending and Receiving Documents and Other Files&#148; section.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The Send Text File command on the Transfer menu is the method for sending text only, <i>without</I> error correction. Use this command to send memos, letters, and so forth when the content of your text alone, without any fonts or formatting, will suffice.</P>
<p>Files you can send with this command are called, of all things, <i>text-only</I> files, also known as ASCII files. (Sometimes they&#146;re just called <i>text files</I>, but this can be a little confusing because a word processing document might also be considered a text file.) Text-only files are standard means of communicating on most electronic-mail services such as MCI Mail. There are several ways to create text-only files:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use a text editor such as Windows Notepad (see Chapter 11, &#147;The Other Windows 2000 Accessories&#148;).
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use a word processing program, such as WordPad, that lets you save a document as a text-only file. Remember that when you save a word processing document as a text-only file, all formatting&#151;including fonts, typestyles, and spacing settings such as margins and indents&#151;will be lost.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use files stored with HyperTerminal&#146;s Capture Text File command (described in the preceding section).
</DL>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Checking Settings for Text-File Transfers</B></FONT></P>
<p>Before sending or receiving a text file, you might want to check the pertinent settings for the connection. Use the following steps:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose File <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-26i.jpg"> Properties or click the Properties button on the toolbar. When the Properties dialog box for this connection appears, switch to the Settings page.<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the ASCII Setup button. The ASCII Setup dialog box that was shown in Figure 15.9 appears.
<p>Only the first choice, Send Line Ends with Line Feeds, pertains to sending text-only (ASCII) files. If you need to add a line feed to the end of each line of text you send, check this box. You might have to talk with the person running the other computer to determine whether line feeds should be added. As discussed earlier, the line and character delays can usually be left at zero, particularly when the receiving computer is expecting a file upload (rather than text input via the keyboard). If the receiving computer complains about text overruns or misses characters, then you will need to use a delay. In the worst case, try 10 or 20 milliseconds for the character delay, and perhaps 50 to 100 milliseconds per line. But again, usually these delays are not necessary and can be left at zero. The three choices in the section labeled ASCII Receiving pertain to receiving text-only files. You can figure out which settings are correct based on the appearance of the text you receive.
</P>
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click OK twice to close the dialog boxes.
</DL>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Sending a Text File</B></FONT></P>
<p>After you&#146;ve selected the correct settings, you&#146;re ready to send the text file. Connect to the other computer if you haven&#146;t already done so. Then follow these steps:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare the other computer to receive the text. If you&#146;re sending an e-mail letter via a BBS or commercial service, for example, type whatever command the service requires to prepare itself for the message. You might need to enter a command such as <b>Create</B> or <b>Send mail</B>, and then enter the name and electronic address of your recipient. Consult the service for details.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the other computer is ready to receive your text, choose Transfer <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-27i.jpg"> Send Text File.<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A standard Windows file dialog box appears. Select the file you want to transfer, then click OK. The text from the file appears on your screen as it is sent to the other computer.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the entire file has been sent, type whatever command the other computer requires to indicate the end of the message or send another file.
