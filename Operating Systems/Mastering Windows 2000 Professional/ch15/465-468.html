<p><font size="+1"><b>Sending Files</B></FONT></P>
<p>To send a file, follow these steps:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure you&#146;re online (connected).
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure the receiving computer is ready to receive the file. How you do this depends on the computer system, BBS, or information service to which you are connected. If you are sending a file to another PC, you may want to type a message in HyperTerminal mode telling the operator of the other computer to do what is necessary to prepare for receiving the file.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-28i.jpg"> Choose Transfer <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-29i.jpg"> Send File or click the Send button on the toolbar. The following small dialog box, labeled Send File, appears.<p><a name="Fig16"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-16.jpg',350,184)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-16t.jpg"></A></P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>You can&#146;t pause a binary transfer but you can stop it in midstream by clicking Stop or choosing Stop from the Transfers menu.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Type the name of the file you want to send (or click Browse, locate and select the file, and click OK to return to the Send dialog box). Then choose the error-detection protocol you want (the one in use by the receiving system).
<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click OK to begin the file transfer.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>By the way, you won&#146;t see the contents of the file on the screen (if it&#146;s not all text, it would look like garbage anyway).<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>You&#146;ll now see a large window reporting the progress of the transfer, as shown in Figure 15.12. At the top, the name of the file being sent is displayed. Next come several readouts on the error-checking process&#151;these are pretty technical, and you can usually ignore them. If something goes seriously wrong, HyperTerminal halts the transfer. At this point, you may be able to diagnose the problem by reading the message displayed at Last Event.
</P>
<p><a name="Fig17"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-17.jpg',440,274)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-17t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-17.jpg',440,274)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 15.12</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#146;ll see a window like this during file transfers.</P>
<p>The (slightly) more interesting part of the display is the lower half. Here, HyperTerminal shows you graphically and in numbers how quickly the transfer is going. The bar graph at File expands to the right giving you a quick sense of how much of the file has been sent so far, relative to its total size. Next to the graph, you&#146;re shown, in numbers, how much of the file has been sent. Below are counters showing how much time has elapsed since the transfer began, how much time is remaining (assuming all goes well, and if HyperTerminal is able to calculate this), and, in the Throughput area, your current &#147;speed.&#148; By clicking the cps/bps button, you can set the display units for throughput speed: characters per second (cps) or bits per second (bps). Characters per second is actually a measure of the number of bytes (8-bit information units) being transferred each second.
</P>
<p>To cancel a file transfer before it has finished, click the Cancel button at the bottom of the window. If the transfer completes normally, you&#146;ll hear a single beep as the window disappears.</P>
<p>As a recap of sending binary files, consider the following: A binary file arrives just as you sent it, with no modifications (for example, no adding or stripping of line feeds). All types of files, including program files, can be sent and received as binary files. Formatted text as well as program files must be transmitted as binary files; otherwise, information will be lost.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Receiving Files</B></FONT></P>
<p>You&#146;ll want to use the Receive File command to transfer document and program (non-text) files to your computer from the computer at the other end of the line. The process of receiving such a file is similar to sending one:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;After connecting to the other computer, tell the sending computer to send the file and the type of file-transfer protocol to use in the process. How you do this depends on the computer and program(s) involved. If you&#146;re connected to a BBS or information service, you can usually control the process from your computer. If you&#146;re connected to another individual&#146;s computer, you ask the person at the other end of the line to type the command to send you the file.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-30i.jpg"> Choose Transfer <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-31i.jpg"> Receive File or click the Receive button on the toolbar.<p>The Receive File dialog box appears. Choose the <i>directory</I> where you want HyperTerminal to store the received file (not the filename, which will be set by the other computer). Type the directory name or use the Browse button to find it. Then select the file-transfer protocol that matches the one used by the other computer. And do all this quickly because the other computer is already trying to send the file. It will wait, but usually not too long.
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Depending on the file-transfer protocol you&#146;re using, HyperTerminal may not know the size of the file being sent to it. In this case, you won&#146;t be able to check whether you have enough disk space for the file and you may run out of disk space while receiving it. This is a real hassle, particularly if you&#146;ve spent half an hour receiving most of a large file only to get an error message saying there isn&#146;t enough room on your disk for the rest of it. When this happens, HyperTerminal aborts the receiving process. So make sure the disk you choose to store the file on has enough free space before you begin the transfer.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click OK or press Enter, and the transmission should begin.
</DL>
<p>After the transfer is underway, a window that looks and works very similarly to the one you see when sending files appears (see Figure 15.12). See the preceding section for details on its use.
