<p><b>Data Connection Preferences</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In this section you&#146;ll learn about the settings contained on the General tab that relate to the Data Connection Preferences. This includes the settings for Port Speed, Data Protocol, Compression, and Flow Control.</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>Port Speed</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed at which your modem transfers information makes a big difference in how much work you can get done during a communications session. Just how fast information can travel between two modems depends on two things: the top speed of the <i>slower</I> modem and the quality of the telephone line.
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>As discussed before, modem speed is measured in bits per second, or <i>bps</I>. Typical modem speeds at this writing range from 2400bps at the low end through 28,800bps and 33,600bps, available with most modems now being sold, to 56,000 bps (56Kbps) for the latest reasonably priced models. At any given speed, some modems achieve even faster transmission rates by <i>compressing</I> the data. When you set the modem speed in Windows 2000, use the value for the actual speed (with compression turned off).<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>In any connection, the theoretical speed limit is set by the slower modem&#151;obviously, having a super-fast modem won&#146;t do you any good when you&#146;re communicating with an old, slow unit. Usually, though, you don&#146;t need to worry about the speed of the other modem. Because most modems can sense the speed of the other modem and automatically adjust their own speed to match, you may be able to leave yours set to its maximum speed. If your modem cannot auto-adjust, though, you&#146;ll have to set its speed to match the other unit (consult your modem&#146;s instruction manual to see if it can auto-adjust). If the two modems are mismatched for speed, you will fail to get a connection, or you may see weird characters or punctuation marks on your screen instead of normal text.
</P>
<p>In practice, the top speed you achieve may be less than the theoretical limit, depending on the quality of the phone line. If there&#146;s much static or distortion on the line&#151;still a problem on some long-distance calls&#151;you may need to drop your speed setting down a notch (from, say, 56,000bps to 33,600bps or from 28,800bps to 14,400bps) to avoid data loss.
</P>
<p>Also, many information services, such as CompuServe, charge more for your connection time when you use a fast modem. You&#146;ll save money if you take advantage of the faster communications speed to get your work done quicker. On the other hand, if you just like to dial up and browse through the available options, you may save money at a slower speed.
</P>
<p>To change the speed setting, display the Connection Preferences dialog box (see Figure 15.6). Then in the Port Speed list box, choose the speed you want. The setting is labeled Port Speed on the assumption that your modem can auto-adjust to lower speeds to match its counterpart on the other end of the line. If your modem lacks this feature&#151;this is unlikely&#151;the speed you choose here will be used exclusively. If you choose the highest possible option, Windows 2000 will try to connect at the fastest speed your modem and computer can handle.
</P>
<dd><b>Data Protocol</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Data Protocol setting refers to the type of error correction to be used on the connection. The default setting of StandardEC enables your modem to negotiate the highest level of error correction that both modems in a session will support. This is usually the best setting since it allows for some flexibility. The ForcedEC setting causes the modem to use only V.42 error correction. If this fails, the call will be terminated. The last setting is Disabled, which turns off error correction entirely.
<dd><b>Compression</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This setting controls how hardware data compression is used, if your modem is capable of compressing data. Don&#146;t worry, though, most modems are capable of this today. Data compression usually results in faster communications, except when you are transferring large files that are already compressed. In this case, enabling hardware compression can actually slow down your session because you are trying to compress something that is already compressed.
<p>Most compression works by finding strings of symbols that repeat in the data and substituting a single code to represent the entire string. Other types of compression, often included in the same compression scheme, will attempt to eliminate blank spaces in the data. These techniques, and others, result in a smaller piece of data than you started with; this new piece can be sent across phone lines faster. Each compressed packet of data has a compression header attached to it that describes how to decompress it.
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Hardware compression may actually slow performance if the data being transmitted is already compressed. Imagine that you have a chunk of data that is already efficiently compressed, and you try to compress it again. The hardware compression will try to eliminate all of the empty space (none) and look for repeating strings to substitute (also none). It finishes its work by attaching a header to the data describing how to decompress it. It&#146;s this header that&#146;s the problem. Since the data is already compressed, adding a header to it makes the chunk of data larger, which means it takes longer to transmit it across the phone lines.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<dd><b>Flow Control</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This setting controls the method used to signal transmission of data. Many programs require some kind of indication that the data sent was received on the other end. Typically this can be done through hardware or software methods. The hardware method uses a scheme called Ready to Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS), which depends on the modem hardware to handle the signaling. The software method is called XON/XOFF, which relies on the operating system to send a signal when the modem is through transmitting. The final option is to disable flow control altogether. Use this last option mostly for troubleshooting.
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The flow-control setting has no effect on the interaction between your modem and the remote computer, so you don&#146;t need to match the other computer&#146;s setting.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>In the process of receiving and sending data, your computer often has to attend to other tasks as well, such as storing information on disk. Sometimes these tasks can distract the computer from handling incoming data. The Flow Control setting in the General tab of the Connection Preferences dialog box determines how <i>your </I>computer interacts with <i>your</I> modem to manage such situations. It provides a way for the computer and the modem to agree when to stop and start the sending process so that other contingencies can be dealt with.
</P>
<p>Unless you know the system will work otherwise, leave the Flow Control box checked. Beneath the check box, choose one of the available flow-control protocols. Hardware flow control is more reliable, so choose its radio button unless your modem isn&#146;t able to respond via hardware.
