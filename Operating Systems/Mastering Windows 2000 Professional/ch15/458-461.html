<h3><a name="Heading18"></A><font color="#000077">Sending and Receiving Data</FONT></H3>
<p>After you&#146;ve made a successful connection, you can begin to transfer data between the two computers. What you do now depends entirely on what the other computer expects from you. If you are calling an information service, BBS, or a mainframe computer, you typically have to sign on to the remote system by typing your name and possibly a password. If you are calling a friend&#146;s or associate&#146;s computer, you can just begin typing whatever you want to say. In any case, after the initial connection is made, there are several ways to begin transferring data between the two computers. The next sections describe these techniques and how to use them.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading19"></A><font color="#000077">Communicating in Interactive Mode</FONT></H4>
<p>The simplest way to communicate information is directly from your keyboard. As mentioned earlier, after you&#146;re connected to the other computer, everything you type is automatically sent to that computer. Conversely, characters typed at the other computer are sent to your computer and show up on your screen. Sending and receiving data this way is called working in <i>interactive</I> or <i>terminal</I> mode. Communications sessions often begin in terminal mode, with each person typing to the other&#146;s screen.</P>
<p>Terminal mode is often used, too, when connecting to many of the information services and e-mail services that are interactive. With these, you type certain commands to the host computer, and it responds by sending you some data. As information comes over the line to your computer, it appears on the screen, as shown in Figure 15.11. As you type, your text appears on the screen as well.</P>
<p><a name="Fig15"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-15.jpg',635,425)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-15t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-15.jpg',635,425)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 15.11</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;A typical interactive session. Notice that the user entered the number 1 in response to the prompt from the sender.</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Understanding How HyperTerminal Displays and Stores Text</B></FONT></P>
<p>As you receive or type each new line of text, the cursor moves down a line in the HyperTerminal window. After the cursor reaches the bottom of the window, each new line shifts the previous text up so the oldest line disappears from view. This is just as text behaves in a word processing program such as WordPad (see Chapter 9, &#147;Using WordPad for Simple Word Processing&#148;).
</P>
<p>But the older text isn&#146;t gone forever. HyperTerminal remembers the last 500 lines in its backscroll buffer. To see text that has scrolled off the screen, use the vertical scroll bar or the standard cursor-movement keys. Then scroll back down to continue interacting with the other computer. (You can scroll through previous text when you&#146;re not connected, too.)</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Capturing Text</B></FONT></P>
<p>At times you&#146;ll want a way to save data you see on your screen while you&#146;re working in terminal mode so you can work with it later. You can <i>capture</I> incoming text at any time during a communications session with the Receive Text File command on the Transfer menu and save it in a disk file for later reading, printing, or editing. Here is the basic procedure for capturing text:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose Transfer <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-22i.jpg"> Capture Text.<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A small dialog box appears, asking you to name the file in which you want the captured text stored. Type the name (you can use the Browse button to select a new directory) but don&#146;t press Enter yet.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click OK. The file opens. If the status bar is visible, the &#147;Capture&#148; message becomes highlighted, indicating the capture is in progress.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue with your session. All incoming text, along with whatever you type as well, is captured in the file you chose. When you want to stop capturing text, choose Transfer <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-23i.jpg"> Capture Text again to display a new submenu (available only when a capture is in progress). Here, you should choose either<dl>
<br>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, to close the file.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Pause, to temporarily discontinue capturing text while leaving the file open for more. To resume the capture, choose Transfer <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-24i.jpg"> Capture Text <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-25i.jpg"> Resume.</DL>
<br>
</DL>
<p>By the way, after you stop a capture, you can add or append text to the same file by simply restarting the capture process and specifying the file again. If you don&#146;t want the new text to go into the previous capture file, you must enter a different filename when you restart the capture process.
</P>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Capturing Selected Portions of Text</B></FONT></P>
<p>During text capturing there may be sections of text you don&#146;t want to save interspersed with portions you do. There are two ways to selectively capture portions of the text that appear in the HyperTerminal window:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use the Pause feature of the Capture command to stop the capture process whenever you&#146;re receiving information you don&#146;t want to keep. When you expect more &#147;good&#148; information, use Resume.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can dispense with the Capture command and just allow HyperTerminal to store the text in its backscroll buffer. You can then scroll through the buffer to copy the information you want to keep into a document in a text-editing program such as Windows Notepad. See &#147;Manipulating Text in the HyperTerminal Window&#148; later in this chapter for details.
