<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading14"></A><font color="#000077">Saving Your Settings</FONT></H4>
<p>HyperTerminal automatically saves the changes in settings you make as soon as you click OK in the Properties dialog box for the current connection as well as in the modem Properties dialog box. However, you can save the settings yourself just to be sure they&#146;re recorded. More practically, you can save the current settings as a new connection. That makes it easy to use existing settings to connect with a different service or computer&#151;all you have to do is change the phone number and then use the Save As command.
</P>
<p>To save the current settings for the connection that&#146;s already active, choose File <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-16i.jpg"> Save. To save them as a new connection, choose File <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-17i.jpg"> Save As. The familiar Save As dialog box appears. Give your connection a name, preferably one that will help you remember which information service or computer the settings are for, and click OK.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading15"></A><font color="#000077">Making Connections</FONT></H3>
<p>Assuming you&#146;ve completed all the setup steps properly, the process of making a connection couldn&#146;t be simpler. All you do is click the Dial button on the Connect dialog box. HyperTerminal displays the Connect dialog box each time you start the program from an existing connection. (Look back at Figure 15.3 for an illustration of the Connect dialog box.)
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If HyperTerminal has displayed the Connect dialog box, but you don&#146;t want to make the connection at this time, just click Cancel to go to the main HyperTerminal window.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>There are other ways to bring up the Connect dialog box to start a new communications session:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-18i.jpg"> When you&#146;re creating a new connection, the Connect dialog box appears after you&#146;ve named the connection, chosen its icon, and typed in a phone number.<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you&#146;re working with the main HyperTerminal window&#151;perhaps after completing a previous communications session&#151;you can display the Connect dialog box again by choosing Call <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-19i.jpg"> Call or clicking the Call button.</DL>
<p>When you click the Call button, HyperTerminal immediately starts the dialing process. You&#146;ll see the Connect message window, informing you of the progress of the call.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you want to stop the dialing process, click Cancel in the Connect window.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Behind the scenes, HyperTerminal begins by sending a series of commands to the modem to prepare it for dialing. These are determined by the settings you&#146;ve chosen, as detailed in the previous sections.
</P>
<p>Then HyperTerminal sends the command to dial the number. At this point, if your modem&#146;s speaker is on, you&#146;ll hear the telephone being dialed. When the phone on the other end is answered, you may hear some high-pitched tones indicating that the modems are &#147;talking&#148; to each other.</P>
<p>If the connection is successful, the message &#147;Connected&#148; appears briefly in the Connect window and you&#146;ll hear three quick beeps. The Connect window then disappears. If you have the status bar visible, you&#146;ll see the message &#147;Connected&#148; at its far left, followed by a time indicator showing how long your computer has been connected to the remote machine in hours, minutes, and seconds.</P>
<p>At this point, if both modems are set up properly, and depending on how the other computer is programmed, you&#146;re likely to see messages from the connection on your screen. From now on, everything you type on the keyboard will be sent to the other computer. You can respond to these messages&#151;or initiate messages of your own&#151;by simply typing whatever you like. And you&#146;re now ready to transfer files from disk in either direction, as discussed later in the &#147;Sending and Receiving Data&#148; section.</P>
<p>A variety of problems can prevent you from successfully communicating. If you are having difficulty, see the &#147;Troubleshooting&#148; section at the end of the chapter for some tips. Disconnecting is discussed in the &#147;Ending a Communications Session&#148; section.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading16"></A><font color="#000077">Making a Different Connection</FONT></H4>
<p>Of course, after opening HyperTerminal from one connection icon and completing your communications session with that computer, you don&#146;t have to shut down the program to call a different destination. All you need to do is choose File <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-20i.jpg"> Open or click the Open button on the toolbar. Pick the connection (session) file you want to open, click Open, and click the Dial button to place the call.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading17"></A><font color="#000077">Connecting Via Cable</FONT></H4>
<p>Although you&#146;ll usually use HyperTerminal to communicate over telephone lines, the program can also transfer information <i>via a serial cable</I> that connects your computer to another computer directly. All you need is the right type of cable: a <i>null-modem</I> cable with jacks that fit the serial ports on the backs of the two computers (a modem is not required and shouldn&#146;t be used).</P>
<p>When you plug the cable into your computer, be sure you know which COM port you&#146;ve connected it to. Then, in HyperTerminal, proceed as follows:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the Properties dialog box for this connection to set up the program for that port. On the Phone Number page, select the correct COM port from the Connect Using list.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Configure button. You&#146;ll see the dialog box full of settings for this COM port shown in Figure 15.10. Select the maximum speed the two computers can reliably handle. The other settings work the same as they do for modems and are described earlier in the chapter. All of them should be set the same on both computers.

<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click OK twice to return to the main HyperTerminal window.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Connect button or choose Call <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch15/images/15-21i.jpg"> Connect to establish the connection. HyperTerminal immediately proceeds with the connection&#151;you won&#146;t see a Dial dialog box or anything similar. If all the settings are correct, you should be able to send messages between the two computers by typing on their keyboards. You can now send and receive text and files just as in a modem-based connection.</DL>
