<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading30"></A><font color="#000077">Special Topic: Running Programs in Dual-Boot Mode with Windows 9<i>x</I>
</FONT></H4>
<p>If hard-drive space is not an issue, you might do well to consider running your system in dual-boot mode, with both Windows 2000 and Windows 9<i>x</I>, because doing so lets you take advantage of the strengths of both operating systems. For example, you could switch to Windows 9<i>x</I> to play the games that Windows 2000 won&#146;t permit and then switch to Windows 2000 to use your word processing program to write about the games in your award-winning hint book. Another use for this arrangement would be to check out how well your favorite applications run under two different systems: You could run them first under 9<i>x</I> and then switch to Windows 2000 and see if it really makes any difference to the way they work.</P>
<p>Unfortunately, it takes a little work to get the programs you installed under Windows 98 operating and running smoothly under Windows 2000. The main obstacle to being immediately able to run all your preinstalled programs is that you now have two system folders. In general, Windows system folders contain all the <tt>.dlls</TT> and other essential program files that enable your programs to run in the first place. Windows 2000 and Windows 9<i>x</I> (and Windows 3.1, for that matter) each have separate system folders. They are set in the path statements for each operating system. The problem is, if you&#146;ve installed Windows 2000 on a system that was already running Windows 9<i>x</I>, all your previously installed applications have their <tt>.dlls</TT> in your Windows 9<i>x</I> system folder. When you try to run those same programs under Windows 2000, Windows 2000 looks for them in its own system folder and of course can&#146;t find them there.</P>
<p>The quick solution to the system folder discrepancy problem is to add your Windows 9<i>x</I> system folder to your Windows 2000 path. By doing that, Windows 2000 looks in both its own and Windows 9<i>x</I>&#146;s system folders. The procedure is discussed in Chapter 20, &#147;Installing Windows 2000 (and Automating Installation).&#148;</P>
<p>But the best way to have programs available to you in both Windows 9<i>x</I> and Windows 2000 is to reinstall the programs in Windows 2000. This isn&#146;t as bad as it sounds. You should choose to install the program in the same folder where it is already installed. Setup programs won&#146;t overwrite any data; they just copy the files that are missing. In the case of the application files, none are missing in the program folder, but all are missing from Windows 2000&#146;s system folder. By reinstalling the application, you are installing the system files Windows 2000 needs to run the application and making the correct Registry entries so the program will run properly.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you&#146;re jumping ahead of the discussion here, be careful: Don&#146;t copy the <i>contents</I> of one system folder into another. Despite the similar natures of Windows 2000 and Windows 9<i>x</I>, they often use different versions of the same files. Replacing even one file with the wrong version can prevent either operating system from running with full functionality, or perhaps even booting at all! Turn to Chapter 20 to read more about the process.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h3><a name="Heading31"></A><font color="#000077">Summary</FONT></H3>
<p>Running all your favorite applications (and even the programs you don&#146;t like) is easier under Windows 2000 than in previous versions of Windows. More than being easier, it&#146;s more convenient. You now have a variety of ways of running and opening files, and with shortcuts, you can put the buttons that you click right where you want them.
</P>
<p>Even though Windows 2000 is a 32-bit operating system, it still runs 16-bit Windows and DOS programs as well or even better than Windows 3.1 or DOS. As you&#146;ll recall, this is because Windows 2000 uses a separate memory space for 16-bit Windows and DOS programs, protecting them from each other and keeping your operating system safe from crashing programs. Remember, if a program does go errant on you, you can put it out of its misery with a swift Ctrl&#43;Alt&#43;Delete key combination.</P>
<p>In short, Windows 2000 enables you to run your programs&#151;almost all of them&#151;better, faster, and more easily.</P><p><br></P>
