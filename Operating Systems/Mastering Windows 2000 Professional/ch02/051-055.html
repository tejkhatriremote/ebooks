<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading26"></A><font color="#000077">Common and Private Applications</FONT></H4>
<p>In Windows 2000, a program can be installed as a Common application or a Private application. A Common application is a program that can be used by anyone with access privileges to that specific computer. For example, if you install a copy of Microsoft Word when you are logged on to a specific workstation, that application will be available to a coworker after you log off and she logs on. Unfortunately, she could even remove the program if she so chooses.
</P>
<p>You can see at a glance which programs and folders are Common and which are Private. The Program submenu of the Windows 2000 Start menu is separated into Private folders on top and Common folders and programs below. A computer icon on the folder represents common folders and programs.</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Folders that are marked Private are those whose access is controlled by the Windows 2000 administrator. (If you are the only person using your computer, <i>you</I> are that administrator, and there is no effective difference between Common folders and Personal folders, because they&#146;re <i>all</I> yours.)<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h3><a name="Heading27"></A><font color="#000077">Installing and Removing Programs</FONT></H3>
<p>Installing and removing programs under Windows 2000 is easy. Almost without exception, programs include their own installation utility that not only copies all their files to the necessary folders but also takes care of creating program groups and placing them on the Program submenu. Removing programs, which has become more and more difficult as programs have become more and more sophisticated and powerful, is also easy, provided you installed them using the better of the two installation procedures outlined below.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading28"></A><font color="#000077">Installing Programs</FONT></H4>
<p>There are two ways to install programs under Windows 2000. Here&#146;s the way you&#146;d probably expect:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Insert the CD-ROM or floppy disk that contains the program you want to install.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open Explorer and navigate to the floppy or CD-ROM drive.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Double-click the program&#146;s Setup or Install program. Follow the directions that the installation routine gives you for installing the program. Many programs have numerous installation options, including Custom, which usually lets you select how many utilities and features you want to install and where you want to install them. Install these programs according to your needs and available disk space. If a program offers you a feature you don&#146;t need, don&#146;t install it. You can always go back later and install the program&#146;s extra features if you change your mind.
</DL>
<p>The best way to install programs, however, is to take advantage of Windows 2000&#146;s install utility, which launches a program&#146;s installation routine for you while offering the added protection of monitoring the software that is being installed. There are two reasons why this monitoring process is useful. First, when a program is installed, it places files in several locations on your hard drive. These files are difficult to locate if you want to completely remove a program from your hard drive. By keeping track of what it installs onto your system, Windows 2000 makes it easier for you if you ever want to uninstall the program at some later time. Second, Windows 2000 can enforce a higher measure of security, preventing deleterious programs from causing damage while being installed.
</P>
<p>To use the Windows 2000 installation utility, do the following:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the Start menu.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose Settings and then Control Panel.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Double-click Add/Remove Programs.
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Install button. You&#146;ll see the applet shown in Figure 2.9.

<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch02/images/02-15.jpg',600,450)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 2.9</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 2000 provides an easy-to-use installation routine.</P>
<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure your program CD-ROM or floppy disk is in its appropriate drive, and click Next.
<dd><b>6.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 2000 locates the installation file. Click the Finish button to complete the process of installing the program. If Windows 2000 can&#146;t find the installation file, click the Browse button to navigate through Explorer and find the file yourself.
</DL>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Another easy way to install an application in Windows 2000 is to use the program&#146;s autorun feature. Most of the applications written for Windows 9<i>x</I> or NT 4 have this ability to automatically run the setup program when you insert the CD-ROM into the computer. This is often the easiest method to use, and usually enables you to remove the program using the Add/Remove Software applet in Control Panel.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading29"></A><font color="#000077">Removing Programs</FONT></H4>
<p>As we mentioned above, Windows 2000 can remove programs for you as well as install them.
</P>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><hr><b>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Windows 2000 can only remove 32-bit &#147;Designed for Windows 95&#148; programs if they were installed with the Windows 2000 installation utility, or if they were specifically written to support the uninstall feature.<hr></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>To remove programs, do the following:
</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the Start menu.
<dd><b>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose Settings and then Control Panel.
<dd><b>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Double-click Add/Remove Programs. You&#146;ll see a list of programs that Windows 2000 has kept track of and that it can remove easily (see Figure 2.10).
<p><a name="Fig16"></A><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch02/images/02-16.jpg',600,450)"><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch02/images/02-16t.jpg"></A>
<br><a href="javascript:displayWindow('../WebStripper/protected.html#link=http://corpitk.earthweb.com/reference/pro/0782124488/ch02/images/02-16.jpg',600,450)"><font color="#000077"><b>Figure 2.10</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 2000 provides a list of installed programs you can remove.</P>
<dd><b>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the program on the list that you want to remove.
<dd><b>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Change/Remove button to remove the program to begin the removal process.
</DL>
<p>Windows 2000 then launches the program&#146;s own uninstall program that was included during installation. Many program suites, such as Microsoft Office or Corel PerfectOffice, let you choose whether to remove only a portion of the suite or its entirety.
