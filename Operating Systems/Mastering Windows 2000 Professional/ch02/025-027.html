<p><big><big>W</BIG></BIG>ithout software, your computer is nothing but an expensive hunk of plastic and metal. It takes software to make your computer come alive and do something useful. An operating system, such as Windows 2000 Professional, serves as the platform for running your application software. Although it is most helpful to learn how to use your favorite applications so that you can be productive with them, it is also important to learn how your software interacts with your operating system. This knowledge will not only help make you a happier and more informed computer user, it will also help you diagnose and solve problems&#151;and perhaps become the envy of your office.</P>
<h3><a name="Heading2"></A><font color="#000077">Eliminating Programs You Won&#146;t Need Anymore</FONT></H3>
<p>When you make the move to Windows 2000 Professional, you won&#146;t need to take all your old DOS and Windows programs with you. Some just won&#146;t work and others have been replaced by utilities that are built into Windows 2000 Professional. In fact, many of your Windows 95 utilities can be left behind since they have been replaced by new built-in utilities. In this section, we&#146;ll discuss which programs you won&#146;t need anymore, why you don&#146;t need them, and what Windows 2000 Professional has replaced them with, if anything at all.
</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading3"></A><font color="#000077">TSRs</FONT></H4>
<p>Terminate and Stay Resident programs (TSRs) are small programs that DOS would run at bootup and then leave in memory for as long as DOS was in operation. They were a mainstay in the days of DOS. As a rule, TSRs would provide functionality not found in DOS. The most common TSRs were those that enabled DOS to use memory more effectively, to load support for your sound card, to use CD-ROM drives or other Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) devices, or to connect to a network.
</P>
<p>You don&#146;t need TSRs under Windows 2000 for a number of reasons. The most important among them is that they won&#146;t work. Even if you had DOS installed and running in dual-boot mode with NT, all aspects of DOS are ignored once NT boots. Windows 2000 would not even be aware of your <tt>CONFIG.sys</TT> file, if it existed. Not that it matters, anyway, the functions that most TSRs were designed for are already present in NT.</P>
<p>The functionality of TSRs is replaced by the Windows 2000 services. If you need to support a program or hardware device with a TSR under DOS or even Windows 95, there is likely to be a counterpart for Windows 2000 that runs as a service.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading4"></A><font color="#000077">Disk Utilities</FONT></H4>
<p>Hard disks need ongoing care to keep them running smoothly and happily. This is still true under Windows 2000, but because of the way Windows 2000 interacts with your computer&#146;s hardware, including hard disks, you can&#146;t use your old disk utilities from DOS or Windows 3.1. Windows 2000 provides its own set of tools for such purposes, and there are third-party, 32-bit utility programs developed to provide even more features than the ones that come with Windows 2000. Just be sure that the utility you choose is compatible with the file systems you are using. Many of the utilities that were designed for Windows NT 4 can still be used under Windows 2000, but you may find that the built-in utilities work fine.
</P>
<p>Windows 2000 includes new utilities for such tasks as defragmenting your hard disks and checking for errors. The defragmenter utility is a new addition to Windows 2000, something that you would have to have purchased separately in NT 4.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading5"></A><font color="#000077">Memory Utilities</FONT></H4>
<p>In the world of DOS, it was a constant battle to work around the 640K memory limit, as it rapidly became apparent that increasingly sophisticated software needed increasingly more memory. The most common DOS utilities were frequently packaged together as programs, such as QEMM, that worked as TSRs and enabled programs to load into memory regions beyond 640K. Windows 3.<i>x</I> was able to take advantage of these programs as well. Windows 2000, however, uses a completely different memory system&#151;a &#147;flat&#148; memory model&#151;and can accommodate far, far more memory than 640K. In fact, there is almost no practical limit on the amount of memory that Windows 2000 can use, so there is no need for memory management utilities.</P>
<p>In theory, you can install up to 4GB of Random Access Memory (RAM) in Windows 2000 Professional, although very few of us will approach this limit for a few years at least. This limit is because of a hardware limitation on the PC-compatible platform. Windows 2000 itself should easily be able to address more memory than that, once the hardware platforms provide support for larger amounts of memory.</P><p><br></P>
