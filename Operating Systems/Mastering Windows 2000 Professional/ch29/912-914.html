<p>A decent number of PCs die each year because they get bad power. It&#146;s not something you can easily detect; it just happens. But you can prevent it.
</P>
<p>PC power problems fall into three categories:</P>
<dl>
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Incorrect voltage&#151;usually too low. Low voltage is called a voltage sag or brownout.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Loss of power altogether.
<dd><b>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Extremely brief (under one 1/100 of a second) increases in voltage and power, called surges or spikes.
</DL>
<p>Low voltage causes your PC&#146;s power supply to try to compensate by drawing more current, which heats up the PC components and shortens their lives. You change voltage on an electrical circuit with a device called a transformer. A transformer that&#146;s smart enough to know whether to move the voltage up or down is called a <i>voltage regulator</I>, and for most PC applications, the name of the device that contains a voltage regulator is a <i>power conditioner</I>. A power conditioner costs $50 and up.</P>
<p>Loss of power altogether requires a battery of some kind. The two kinds of battery backup are <i>standby power supply</I> (<i>SPS</I>) and <i>uninterruptible power supply</I> (<i>UPS</I>). An SPS has a battery that &#147;wakes up,&#148; so to speak, when power to the PC is interrupted. Because an SPS doesn&#146;t always wake up fast enough, you need an SPS with a switching time (wake-up time) of 4 milliseconds or less. A UPS, in contrast, is always supplying power from the battery (while refilling it, of course) and so has no switching time. Before you run out and buy a UPS, however, understand that an SPS costs $100 and up, and a UPS costs $500 and up. Clever marketers call their SPSs &#147;UPSs&#148; and sell them for $300. If in doubt, ask about the switching time.</P>
<p>Surges and spikes can be brushed aside by a power conditioner. Do <i>not</I> buy a surge protector, a cheap device that does little to protect you from power problems. A surge protector is based on a device called a Metal Oxide Varistor (MOV), which is a &#147;kamikaze&#148; device: After you get a little surge, the MOV stops the surge but dies in the process. The <i>next</I> surge goes through without trouble.</P>
<p>We recommend devices created by American Power Conversion called the Smart-UPS line. Despite their name, these devices are not UPSs but rather a combination of an SPS and a power conditioner. They start at about $200 discounted. (To read more about PC power problems and solutions, pick up the latest edition of <i>The Complete PC Upgrade and Maintenance Guide</I>, by Mark Minasi, from Sybex.)</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading5"></A><font color="#000077">Install NT Properly</FONT></H4>
<p>A look back at Chapter 20, &#147;Installing Windows 2000 (and Automating Installation),&#148; will remind you that you&#146;ve got a lot of choices to make when you install Windows 2000. It&#146;s easy to make a wrong choice, leading to a bad installation. If necessary, reinstall Windows 2000 or your Windows 2000 applications. If you reinstall a piece of software, however, don&#146;t install it on top of an existing installation; that often doesn&#146;t wipe the old installation clean. Before reinstalling any software, remove it completely and check the Registry for any leftover pieces.
</P>
<p>We spend a lot of time telling you how to upgrade from an earlier version of Windows 2000, but the truth is, the most stable and reliable installations you can get are built from the ground up. This usually means installing on a freshly formatted hard drive, then installing applications. If you simply must perform an upgrade, be sure to disable all third-party services. Heck, disable all the services you can easily live without for a while. The less that Setup has to worry about, the fewer things that can go wrong.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading6"></A><font color="#000077">Obtain the Latest Tested Drivers for Your Hardware</FONT></H4>
<p>Although Windows 2000 is a solidly built system, it does have one fairly large Achilles&#146; heel (or maybe a whole Achilles&#146; foot): drivers. Third-party drivers don&#146;t often get tested thoroughly. All drivers are suspect; so try the simplest drivers available.
</P>
<p>For example, when updating a driver, keep the old one around just in case the update isn&#146;t so &#147;up.&#148; If you&#146;re experiencing video problems, you can always rely on the VGA driver.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading7"></A><font color="#000077">Always Shut Down Windows 2000 Properly</FONT></H4>
<p>Most people seem to know this by now, because Windows 3.<i>x</I>, OS/2, and Windows 9<i>x</I> all require it, but it&#146;s worth repeating that you should <i>shut down Windows 2000 properly</I>. Don&#146;t just turn off the computer; choose Start and then Shut Down.</P>
<p>If you don&#146;t do that, you stand not only to lose data from your applications, but you may damage the operating system. If you are using only NTFS-formatted disks, the damage will be less than it would be with a FAT disk (NTFS incorporates fault-tolerant features), but you could lose data nevertheless.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading8"></A><font color="#000077">Back Up Your Disk Regularly</FONT></H4>
<p>We shouldn&#146;t have to say this, but&#133;
</P>
<p>The hard disks in most people&#146;s PCs aren&#146;t backed up. And there are as many excuses for this as there are PCs. But there&#146;s no reason for it, at least not anymore. Iomega&#146;s Zip drives are a terrific way to quickly and easily save 100MB of data onto a thing that <i>looks</I> like a floppy but that stores much more data. Tape drives get cheaper all the time. And we just can&#146;t say enough about the value of CD-ROM burners for backups.</P>
<p>And Windows 2000 even comes with a backup program, Backup. It&#146;s extremely simple to run; you&#146;ll find it in the System Tools group. Start it and follow the on-screen instructions.</P>
<h4 align="LEFT"><a name="Heading9"></A><font color="#000077">Be Sure You&#146;re Authorized to Do Something before Doing It</FONT></H4>
<p>As you&#146;ve read elsewhere in this book, living with Windows 2000 means thinking differently because you&#146;re now living in a more secure world. That means that you may run into a kind of trouble fairly new to PC users&#151;the inability to do a particular function on your system.
</P>
<p>For example, imagine that when someone logs on to your network, he or she runs a logon batch script that synchronizes his or her PC&#146;s clock with the time on the server; the command is <tt>net time/set/yes</TT>. When you log on to a Windows 2000 workstation as a simple domain user, you get an error indicating that you don&#146;t have the right to set the PC&#146;s clock.</P>
<p>Now, if you are a network techie, you would likely understand this error message and where it comes from&#151;again, the account you used to log on is too low on the network&#146;s totem pole, so to speak. But for a regular, less-technical user, it could be somewhat disconcerting.</P><p><br></P>
