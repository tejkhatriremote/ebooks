1) Description<P>

This package contains the schematic and a PCB-layout for a FM oscillator using
the BF900 Dual Gate Mosfet, and can be used between 90 and 110 MHz. Specific
things about this oscillator is that it has very low noise, and it is very
stable. If you use proper buffering, a PLL shouldn't be necessary any more
(although it is ofcourse possible to use one).
<P>
The <a href="bf900sch.gif">schematic </a> is here.
<p>

The frequency is first set by trimmer C4. Adjustments can be made with R8
(VFO range is about 4 MHz).
<P>
Some testing gave me next results:<P>
<PRE>
(Frequency = 100 MHz; Output = 50 Ohm Dummy (20 * 1K/1W par; homebrew);
 Input = Sweeposcillator 0.5-55 kHz (Stereo Coder));
Power Supply    : 15 V DC ('no ripple');
Input Current   : 50 mA
RF Output       : 55 mVpp
Freq. Deviation : 0.005 MHz (after 10 hours; the deviation had taken place
                  during the first hour, after that no deviation)
</PRE><P>
2) Components/Hints
<P>
Use a good quality PCB, the other side is copper, make some connections
between the two sides. Build the oscillator in a RF-proof casing, use good
connectors and cable, and be aware of all the other RF-rules of building.
<P>
To mount the BF900 a hole (diameter about 6 mm) must be made where the casing
can hang in. I myself had problems with the 'other side copper' thing, because
my oscillator wouldn't turn on (not too enough noise?? just kidding). It was
solved when I removed the copper under the BF900 (about 1 - 1.5 cm diameter).
If someone has an explanation for it, let me know...
<P>
You could use a zener-stabilisation instead of the 7800-regulator. The only
problem is that it could cause a DC-ripple on the oscillator, and that will
be noticed as humm. A voltage regulator isn't so expensive, so don't cut
down expenses on it.
<P>
Instead of the BF900, a BF905 or BF907 can be used without any problems. Maybe
a BF981 would do also, but that I haven't tested.

3) Problems?
<P>
If you have certain problems, you have to try to solve them yourself first.
But if no solutions can be found you can contact me, so we can try to work it
out. This circuit is build by me and it works.
<P>
You can also contact me if you have some interesting schematics or material,
use E-mail: ericg@stack.urc.tue.nl (at least untill October 1994).<P>
Ofcourse you can use the same adress for other questions or comments on this
schematic.
