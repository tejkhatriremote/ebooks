<H2>DO IT NOW!</H2>

<P>
	You have been reading and hearing about micro power broadcasting
over the last year or so, now is the time to go out and do it !  In this
issue we are providing the inspiration.  People around the world are
taking back the airwaves, from Taiwan, where it took 7000 police to shut
down 14 stations with most going back on the air after the raids, to
Haiti, where a broadcasting operation was temporarily shut down with
automatic weapons fire resulting in the death of 12 people, a few were
able to escape with the transmitter.  Here, in the Americas, transmitters
are taking to the air in Chiapas and Mexico City.  San Francisco now has
two stations, San Francisco Liberation Radio and Radio LIbre, on the air
every night of the week.  Mabana Kantako (Black Liberation Radio), who is
an inspiration to many, has been on the air 24 hours a day for over three
years in Springfield, Illinois.  Reports continue to come in of new
operations going on the air.  We are riding the wave of a movement that
will not be stopped. 
<P>
	Rapid spreading of knowledge and inspiration is a critical aspect
of this movement.  Further, it must be acted upon for it to have any
impact.  Such is the main purpose of this publication.  Empowerment is our
watchword. 
<P>
	On the other side of this cover page you will be reading quite an
amazing and diverse selection of articles.  In addition, our line of kits
is continuing to expand.  A phase lock loop (PLL) controlled 1/2 watt
transmitter kit has been added.  It will drive the 6-8 watt, 10-15 watt
and 20-24 watt amplifiers directly.  With this type of digital control the
frequency will not drift.  Now, with this new kit along with proper output
filtering, all the technical objections of the FCC regarding drift and
harmonic interference can be met.  By sometime in November AM and UHF TV
transmitters will be introduced. 
<P>
	Recognizing a good many people do not have the necessary technical
skills to assemble the kits and put a station together, those of you who
do have these skills are needed to act as technical mentors.  An entire
grass roots infrastructure must be organized, collectives consisting of
people with diverse interests and skills.  Knowledge and skill not shared
with others is an anathema to creating any sort of grass roots community. 
Many inspired people really yearn to put a station on the air but lack the
ability to do so.  It is our responsibility to help them realize their
dream.  By teaching and working with others your own base of knowledge and
experience will grow as well.  Particular attention must be paid to youth
in the inner cities. 
<P>
	When people develop their own collective community voice it is an
extremely empowering act, one that threatens the status quo in a rather
serious way since disenfranchisement and disempowerment are two majors
ways of keeping people down in the dirt.  Lack of communication creates
extremely negative situations where worst case assumptions are made and
suspicion, mistrust, anger, and violence are a natural outgrowth of an
alienated populace.  Micropower broadcasting has the power to break down
these barriers and restore a sense of true community. 
<P>
	Create, nurture and build community, share your skills and dreams
and put your voice on the air.  Get an internet account so news,
information and ideas can be rapidly spread amongst all of us.  Sometime
soon our radio programs will be digitally recorded, compressed and put on
the net for distribution.  Organize public forums and discussions on the
democratization of all media.  If you want to distribute this newspaper
and other materials in your area please let us know the quantity to send
to you,
