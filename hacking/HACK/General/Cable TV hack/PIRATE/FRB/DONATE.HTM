An appeal for funds.  In order to continue the work we are doing any
donations to support the effort would be greatly appreciated.  This
movement is becoming international in scope.  Special funding is needed to
send a representative from Free Radio Berkeley to AMARC's world radio
conference in Senegal which will be attended by community and native media
activists from around the world.  Free Radio Berkeley has been asked to
set up a 300 watt FM station for the duration of the conference.  It is
extremely important that this occurs.  Expenses for the trip are projected
to be around $1800-$2000.  Checks and such are to be made out to Free
Radio Berkeley.
