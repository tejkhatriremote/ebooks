		   "...the FCC is arguably violating its<BR>
	    statutory mandate as well as the First<BR>
	    Amendment, by refusing to revisit the issue<BR>
	    [of the ban on very low power FM<BR>
	    broadcasting]...The Court finds that the<BR>
	    harm to the First Amendment rights of<BR>
	    Defendant and the public at large which may<BR>
	    result from enforcing the current<BR>
	    regulations, outweighs the slight showing of<BR>
	    interference proffered by the<BR>
	    government...."<BR>

     In an almost textbook example of partnership with a growing
and vital movement of committed activists, the Guild through its
Committee on Democratic Communications (CDC) has been forging a
new area of law and giving a vital democratic movement the legal
and moral space in which to grow.
<P>
     From "pirate" radio to "micro" radio; from defiantly
tweaking the nose of authority to developing grass roots,
effective, cheap means of piercing the media screen, the Guild
and the micro radio movement have been working together to open
the radio spectrum.
<P>
     In an unprecedented move, the United States District Court
for the Northern District of California, on January 20th, refused
to grant the government an injunction against the admittedly
unlicensed low power broadcasting of Free Radio Berkeley.
<P>
     For years it has been the law that in order to broadcast
over the air, one must have a license.  Since the 1970's, the FCC
has refused to consider even an application for a license for
less than one hundred watts of power.  The first level of the
license application process involves a pile of forms half an inch
thick and a $2,900.00 filing fee.  In short, without mega bucks
and access to high-priced Washington lawyers, there is no way a
citizen can obtain a license to broadcast.

     Five years ago, the CDC received a plea for help from Mbanna
Kantako, an unemployed, blind black man who had scraped together
a few hundred dollars for a couple of black boxes which when
connected to a microphone and an antennae wire out his housing
project window, put him on the air with one watt of power.
Mbanna had been involved in organizing the tenants in the John
Jay Homes public housing project in Springfield Illinois.  He
went on the air as WTRA (W. Tenant's Rights Association).  WTRA
was the only station serving the Springfield African American
Community.  It broadcast music, community news, recorded speeches
and much else.  Much of the programming and operation of the
station was done by Mbanna's sons and other youth from the
community.  No one bothered them for almost two years, until some
kids in the projects reported that housing authority police beat
them up.  Mbanna put them on the air to tell their story and
surprise!  The next week the FCC, backed by the local police, was
there to shut him down.
<P>
     The CDC had been looking at issues of media reform and had
held a major symposium at the 1989 Guild convention on the
responsibility of the media under international covenants
(against racism, for women's rights and the like).  The CDC
recognized the importance of radio done cheaply and easily by
people, we saw it as the grass roots "green media" of the future.
