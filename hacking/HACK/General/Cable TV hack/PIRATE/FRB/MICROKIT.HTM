<P>
<H5>First, a word from our legal department: For educational purposes only. 
These kits are offered for the furtherance of one's knowledge regarding
radio frequency design and principles.  At all times during operation the
assembled unit must be connected to a dummy load.  Part 15 of the FCC
rules prohibits an antenna being used with these units.  All
responsibilities for the ultimate use of these kits are born solely by the
builder and/or operator.

<H3>KITS AVAILABLE NOW !</H3><HR>
</center>
	All kits are complete and come with professionally manufactured,
drilled and tinned PC boards.  All coils are pre-wound.  Each unit, unless
specified, requires 12 volts for proper operation.  Full instructions and
diagrams included.  Required tools include a 25-30 watt soldering iron
with a fine tip, diagonal cutters, needle nose pliers, assorted
screwdrivers and other small hand tools.  Full assembly diagrams and
instructions are included with each kit.  Antenna construction diagrams
are provided with each transmitter or amplifier order.
<P>
	Certain kits are designed to work with each other.  For those
whose wish to boost the output of their Ramsey FM-10 the 1/2-1 watt amp
will work very well for this purpose.  The 30 watt amp is designed to be
driven by 3-5 watts and works extremely well with the 5 watt transmitter. 
The 15 watt amplifier is designed to be driven to full power with about
1/2 watt of input power, hence it works very well with the 1/2 watt stereo
transmitter or PLL transmitter.  If you wish to only boost a 1/2 watt
signal to 5-7 watts then choose the 6 watt amplifier kit.  An amplifier
only increases the output power of a given input signal, it can not
produce an FM signal whereas a transmitter or an exciter creates the FM
signal at a suitable power level for possible further amplification by an
RF amplifier. 1/2-1 Watt PLL Transmitter - $95 Our newest kit.  Full
digital PLL control locks the frequency and prevents any drift from
happening.  Will easily drive the 6-8, 10-15, and 20-24 watt amplifier
kits.  Easy to assemble and a major improvement over the Panaxis PLL kit. 
If you have one of our 5 watt transmitter kits, they can be modified to be
driven by the PLL transmitter.  Full instructions are provided for this
modification.

<LI>1/2 - 1 watt Stereo Broadcast Transmitter - $50<BR>
	A vast improvement over the Ramsey FM-10.  It uses the BA1404 IC as
a stereo modulator only to modulate a FET vfo, buffer and amp chain. 
Better audio input filtering and bypassing.  IC voltage regulation for the
2.5 volt supply for the BA1404.  A very rugged output stage and collector
voltage bypassing make this unit stand out from all other transmitter
designs using the BA1404 chip.  Requires 12 volts DC 
<P>
<LI>5 Watt FM Transmitter- $55<BR>
	An improved version of the Panaxis 5 watt design with a much more
rugged output transistor capable of producing 5-6 watts.  This is a very
good basic unit that is very compact, fits into a 4 x 6 inch enclosure
(available punched and drilled).  Frequency stability is maintained by a
well designed oscillator section.  It is a mono unit that accepts line
level input (i.e. an audio signal from a tape deck, mixer, etc.).  A fine
frequency adjustment control allows for easy adjustment of operating
frequency.  To increase power of this transmitter use the 30 watt
amplifier.  Both will fit into a 7 x 7 inch enclosure (available punched
and drilled).  Requires 12 to 14 volts DC at 3/4 to 1 amp for operation. 
<P>
<LI>6 watt RF Amplifier - $30<BR>
	Uses the same output transistor as above.  It is designed to boost
low wattage transmitters to a bit higher output power and will produce up
to 8 watts of output power.  A very small and compact circuit measuring 3
x 1 1/2 inches for 1/2 watt input drive.  Easy, quick assembly.  Requires
12-14 volts DC at 3/4 to 1 amp for operation.  
<P>
<LI>15 watt RF Amplifier - $50<BR>
	Uses a very high gain (14dB, power gain of at least 25X) RF
transistor to boost a 1/2 watt input to 15 watts.  Perfect for boosting
the 1/2 stereo transmitter to 15 watts.  Measures 2 1/2 by 5 inches and
fits into a 4 x 6 enclosure (available punched and drilled).  Includes
heat sink.  Easy, point to point surface mount assembly.  Requires 12-14
volts at 2 amps for operation. 
<P>
<LI>20 -24 watt RF amplifier - $95<BR>
	$95 might sound a bit steep, but for those who do not wish to do an
extensive amount of soldering and tuning, this is kit is for you.  It uses
a broad band high gain, RF power module which will put out a 20-24 watt
signal for only a 100 to 200 miliwatt input.  Kit requires less than 20
solder connections to complete, including a 5 element filter.  Since the
module is broad band from 88 to 108 MHz no tuning is required, plug and
play as they say.  Requires 12-14 volts at 3 to 4 amps. 
<P>
<LI>25-30 watt RF Amplifier - $60<BR>
	Will produce full power with an input drive of 3-5 watts.  This
unit works very well with the 5 watt transmitter kit.  In fact, next to
the 5 watt kit, it is our most popular item.  Fits a 4 x 6 inch enclosure
(available punched and drilled).  Easy point to point surface mount
assembly.  Includes heat sink. Requires 12-14 volts DC at 4-5 amps for
operation. 
<P>
<LI>1/2 to 1 watt Amplifier - $25<BR>
	1/2 to 1 watt output for an input power of 10 mw.  Great for
boosting lower power VFOs and low power Ramsey FM-10 type kits.  Very
compact size, 3 1/2 X 1 1/2 inches.  An optional transistor can be
substituted to take the power up to 1 1/2 watts, add $5 for this option. 
<P>
<LI>Output Filter Kit - $8.00<BR>
	A seven element low pass filter, composed of 4 coils and 3
capacitors, to flatten those harmonics.  Specify cutoff frequency desired,
94 MHz, 100 MHz, 104 MHz, 108 MHz.  The cutoff should be about 2 to 4 MHz
above the frequency the transmitter is set for.  Please use a filter on
any transmitter you to use to avoid possible interference with other
services. 
<P>
<LI>15 Watt Dummy Load Kit - $10.00<BR>
	Essential for tuning up and testing transmitters and amplifiers.
Will handle 15 watts without any strain, higher powers for a briefer
period of time (i.e. shut down when it gets rather hot).  Presents a
uniform 50 ohm impedance to the transmitter. 
<P>
<LI>25 Watt Dummy Load Kit - $20<BR>
	As above, use this with the 30 watt kit for testing and loading
purposes. Uses a single, film non-inductive resistor
<P>
<LI>50 Watt Dummy Load Kit - $35<BR>
	Same design as the 25 watt unit, use this if you plan on running
the 30 watt unit for an extended period of time with a dummy load.

	These are partial kits, just go to your local plumbing supply or
hardware store for the copper pipe and/or wire needed for completion. 
Full construction diagrams and instructions included. 
<P>
<LI>J-Pole - $20<BR>
	Metal box drilled with SO239 connector, tuning cap and tubing
clamps.  This one is know as the "electricians special" since it uses
mostly electric hardware in its construction.  Works very well for urban
areas.  No soldering of copper pipe required for assembly.  Can be
adjusted for operation over the entire FM band. 
<P>
<LI>Slim Jim - $15<BR>
	SO239 connector and clamps.  Works very well for urban areas where
a powerful horizontal pattern is needed.  If used at too great of height,
an area surrounding the antenna will be skipped over due to its low angle
of radiation.  Even at a height of only about 12 feet mounted on a traffic
sign pole this antenna was able send a 5 watt signal 2-3 miles.  Requires
soldering of copper pipe.  Can be placed inside a 6" piece of black
plastic pipe for concealment.  Provides a gain of 2-3. 
<P>
<LI>Dipole - $20<BR>
	Plastic box, SO239 and clamps.  Easy and quick design.  Can be
concealed by placing inside a 4" piece of black plastic pipe. 
<P>
<LI>5/8 Ground Plane - $30<BR>
	All necessary parts except copper element and ground radials. 
This is a great design and works extremely well.  It is very portable and
will boost the power by a factor of 2 to 4.

<H4>METERS</H4><HR><P>
</center>

<LI>Power & SWR Meters<BR>
	These are essential to the proper tuning and setting up of both
transmitters and antennas.  An antenna has to be fine tuned so that it
accepts the full power of the transmitter and reflects the lowest amount
possible back, that ratio of forward power to reflected power is know as
the standing wave ratio (SWR).  The various stages of both transmitters
and amplifiers have adjustable capacitors which are used to tune the unit
to the frequency of operation.  A power meter allows you to see the effect
of these adjustments on the power level and to set everything at an
optimum level. 
<P>
<LI>Economy Power/SWR meter - $35<BR>
	A compact in-line unit that works up to a frequency range of 150
MHz. 
<P>
<LI>High Quality Daiwa Meter - $100<BR>
	A dual cross needle meter that shows both forward and reflected
power on the same meter face.  Makes tuning up very easy, no need to
switch back and forth between these two functions.  Compact design with 12
volt connection for lighting the meter face. 
<P>

<H4>FREQUENCY COUNTER</H4>
</center>
<HR>
<P>
	To accurately maintain your operating frequency a digital
frequency counter is highly recommended.  A digital tuner with signal
strength indication can be used as a substitute.  We have a frequency
counter available for $80.00

<H4>COAXIAL CABLES</H4>
</center>
<HR>
<P>
	A coaxial cable is a special type of wiring that has an inner
conductor surrounded by an insulating plastic sheath which is covered by a
braid of copper wire that is then covered by a plastic jacket.  The 75 ohm
video cable used in home TV applications is one type of coaxial cable. 
For most RF purposes, 50 ohm cable is used.  Quite a number of 50 ohm
coaxial cables are available ranging from the rather small to cables over
1" in diameter.  Regardless of the type, all such cables exhibit a loss
that increases with frequency of operation and the length of the cable. 
For most purposes we will concern ourselves with RG8 and RG8x (mini
version of RG8).  In very short runs RG58 can be used, but we prefer RG8x
due to its lower loss and ability to stand a bit more abuse.  RG8 has the
lowest loss of the group.  Under no circumstances should the cables be
twisted, kinked or crushed, this will cause major problems.  We supply
both RG8X and RG8 in the following lengths.  Each end is terminated with a
PL259 plug. RG8X:  25 feet - $15, 50 feet - $25, 75 feet- $35, 100 feet -
$40 RG8: 50 feet - $32, 75 feet - $42, 100 feet - $52
