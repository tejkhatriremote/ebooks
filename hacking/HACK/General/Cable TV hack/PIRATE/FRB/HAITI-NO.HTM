<H3>A LITTLE VOICE  THAT SAYS NO</H3>
</center>
<P>
      The lambi (a gathering call usually made with the aid of a sea
shall) rings out.  "Asosye li jou!" (Friend, the day has begun!) "Leve
kanpe!" (Time to rise!) "Soley la leve!" (The sun's up!) It is 6 a.m., and
the clandestine radio "Soley Leve" has started its broadcast on 94.9 MHz
FM.  It will continue until 8 a.m. and come back on the air at 8 p.m.
<P>
      Created in 1993, this station has made a name for itself in
Port-au- Prince.  The residents of the shanty towns surrounding the
capital enthusiastically welcomed the renewal of its programming at the
end of 1993, following an interruption for unspecified reasons in October
of the same year.
<P>
      The low-power station is a daily headache for the military. 
According to a reliable source, the men under Michel Francois (the current
police chief) are actively searching for its broadcasting headquarters. 
Serge Beaulieu, a fervent supporter of the military and the owner of Radio
Liberte, which is just next to Soley Leve on the dial, complains of
problems that the "pirate station" causes for his own programs.  At the
time of the signing of the Governors Island Agreement and the New York
Pact,ppealed to grass-roots sectors to continue their resistance, even
now, 29 months after the coup.
<P>
      "Komite rezistans pou jodi" (resistance committee today) and
"komite rezistans pou demem" (resistance committee tomorrow) are continual
announcements on Radio Pep Ayisyen (People of Haiti), Soley Leve's sister
station, which broadcast its first program in April 1992.  After silencing
its transmitters for more than six months, Radio Pep Ayisyen renewed its
regular programming in February 1994.
<P>
      A drumbeat announces that this station, usually called "Radio pep
la," (radio of the people) is about to come on the air.  In
Port-au-Prince, the country's capital, people tune in at 1600 kHz AM. Its
antennas are turned on about six times each day, with different schedules
for each region of the country.  This seems to be intended to overcome the
problem of low transmission power.
<P>
      Radio Pep Asyen provides time for international news, in addition
to its editorials and national news bulletins.  "The suffering, struggles
and victories of one people are the business of all peoples," the radio
explains in an ad.  In the time slot entitled "kozman pep la" (chatting
with the people) the residents of poor neighborhoods and rural areas voice
their demands and speak their minds regarding the country's problems.
<P>
      The same formula was used by Radio Lave Je (literally: washing
living under cover in Port-au-Prince.  However, they are determined to
resume Radio Lave Je's programming.
<P>
      Since President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was overthrown on September
30, 1991, several clandestine radios have come into being in Haiti.  Radio
Resistance Lavalas made its first broadcast immediately after the coup. 
It represented a breath of fresh air for the people of Port- au-Prince
throughout the dark days of late 1991.  During that same period Radio 29
Novembre became well known.  These initiatives did not last very long, but
they did make it possible to speak out despite a prohibition enforced at
gunpoint.  They represented a turning point that will leave a permanent
mark on the evolution of radio in Haiti. Gotson Pierre CRAD Information
