<H2>A Tale of Two Broadcasters</H2>
<P>
<H6>By Jeff Cohen and Norman Solomon</H6>
<P>
<P>
     Jack Welch oversees a project that fills America's airwaves
with millions of watts. His outfit has committed felonies that
include bribery and large-scale fraud.
<P>
     Stephen Dunifer oversees a project with 15 watts of radio
power. He and his organization have never been found guilty of a
crime.
<P>
     Guess which man is in trouble with the Federal
Communications Commission.
<P>
     It isn't Welch, the chair of NBC's parent company, General
Electric. In spite of a criminal rap sheet as long as a
transmitting tower -- with massive swindles involving sales of
military equipment -- GE continues to run NBC's broadcasting
operations.
<P>
     In theory, the FCC evaluates the "character" of would-be
broadcast licensees. A few years ago the agency declared it would
"consider all felony convictions" and sometimes even
misdemeanors. But GE, a corporate felon, has gotten no grief from
the FCC about its criminal record.
<P>
     On the other hand, Stephen Dunifer is one of the FCC's prime
targets. He has developed a low-cost, low-watt way that neighbors
can use radio to communicate with each other. For $600, he
discovered, people can build a mini-station and go on the air.
<P>
     Dunifer takes seriously the idea that the airwaves belong to
the public, not just those with big bucks. Worst of all, from the
FCC's vantage point, Dunifer has spread the idea around.
<P>
     His nonprofit newsletter recently touted gizmos like "a
phase lock loop controlled half-watt transmitter kit," designed
to meet "all the technical objections of the FCC regarding drift
and harmonic interference."
<P>
     But Dunifer's emphasis is hardly technical; it's community
oriented. His newsletter hails micropower broadcasting as a tool
that communities can use to break down the barriers of
"suspicion, mistrust, anger and violence" bred by a lack of
communication.
<P>
     The micropower concept got a boost four years ago, when
Mabana Kantako -- living in a housing project in Springfield,
Ill. -- founded Black Liberation Radio, a low-watt station.
Despite harassment from local police and the FCC, Kantako and the
station are still on the air, serving needs of nearby residents
unmet by mass media. 
<P>
     Dunifer, who lives in Berkeley, Calif., learned from
Kantako's example, and set to work refining the micro-technology.
Now, he says, "We are riding the wave of a movement that will not
be stopped." He may be right.
<P>
     Across the bay, in San Francisco, two independent
microbroadcasters are on the radio every night.
<P>
     In the Mexican state of Chiapas, microradio programs aligned
with the rebel Zapatistas can be heard, courtesy of equipment
supplied by Dunifer. In downtown Mexico City this fall, a central
traffic island became the base of Radio TeleVerdad ("Radio Tell-
the-Truth"), providing five-watt FM transmission while hundreds
of thousands of vehicles passed by each day.
<P>
     When we spoke with founders of Radio TeleVerdad a couple of
weeks ago, they seemed determined to continue their independent
broadcasts -- despite an Oct. 19 raid by 150 Mexican police, who
swarmed over the traffic island and confiscated the transmitter
along with studio equipment.
<P>
     In Taiwan a few months ago, several thousand government
troops raided 14 unauthorized makeshift radio stations on the
same day. Protests and riots ensued.
<P>
     Here at home, the FCC has slapped Stephen Dunifer with all
kinds of legal documents, threatening to fine him $20,000. The
goal: to prevent him from going into hills near his home and
airing a mix of music and political commentary. But Dunifer keeps
transmitting "Free Radio Berkeley."
<P>
     A guiding principle of microbroadcasting is that small-
scale decentralized communication can nurture democracy. In
contrast to media behemoths, requiring huge financial resources
and dominating wide geographic areas, microbroadcasters don't
need a lot of money -- and if a listener wants to talk with the
broadcasters directly, they're no more than a bicycle-ride away.
<P>
     The FCC contends that such unauthorized broadcasts interfere
with big-power licensed stations. But Dunifer points out that in
neighborhoods there are many openings on the dial. After about
100 of his broadcasts, Dunifer says he has yet to receive a
complaint of radio frequency interference -- except for
objections from FCC officials, who went out of their way to
intercept and monitor his signal with their radio gear.
<P>
     San Francisco attorney Luke Hiken asserts that the FCC
actions against his client are "content oriented," motivated by
government hostility toward Dunifer's anti-establishment
activism. Hiken cites unlicensed radio broadcasters operating
with FCC knowledge but without FCC opposition -- such as an
unauthorized Southern Oregon station airing Tommy Dorsey music.
<P>
     Even if the FCC is able to stop Dunifer -- who has invited
federal enforcers to "kiss my Bill of Rights" -- it's probably
too late for the feds to short circuit microradio. Says Dunifer:
"It is our intent and purpose to see thousands of transmitters
taking to the air in an all-out, no-holds-barred movement of
electronic civil disobedience." (He can be reached by phone at
510-464-3041, or via e-mail: frbspd@crl.com.)
<P>
     While Dunifer does battle with the FCC, the General Electric
moguls in charge of NBC are engaged in a very different turf
battle -- with a competing media giant, the Fox TV network.
<P>
     In early December, Fox went to the FCC with a petition
challenging General Electric's control of broadcast licenses in
view of GE's "pattern of illegal activity." The Fox petition was
a counterattack against GE, which a week earlier had told the FCC
that Fox's foreign ownership violates federal rules.
<P>
     The chances are tiny that the FCC will banish GE from the
broadcasting business. But if lightning strikes and GE loses its
status as a mega-broadcaster, Jack Welch might want to consider
trying his hand at a more humble role.
<P>
     For a few hundred dollars, Welch can set up his own 15-watt
radio station. Stephen Dunifer would be glad to show him how.
