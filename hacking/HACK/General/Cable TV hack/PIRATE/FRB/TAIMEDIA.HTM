<H2><B>TAIWAN</B>: FIGHTING FOR DEMOCRATIC MEDIA</H2>

      In 1947, the ruling party in Taiwan, KMT, imposed martial law on
the island. Newspaper, radio and television were firmly controlled
thereafter by the government. Even though martial law was finally lifted
in 1987, the three existing television stations are still run by various
arms of the state apparatus. TTV is owned by the Taiwan Provincial
Government. CTV is run by KMT; and CTS takes its orders from the military.
Through its direct or indirect control over the two major newspapers and
three television stations, the ruling party has been able to effectively
manipulate public opinion and greatly restrict freedom of speech. 
<P>
      In the eighties, demand for democracy swept over Taiwan; and
martial law was increasingly challenged by voices from the opposition
movement. Farmers, workers, environmentalists and human rights activists
took their causes to the streets to demand legalised protection of their
rights. To suppress the waves of social protests that were pushing Taiwan
toward democratization, the KMT relied on the use of force by the military
and the police. Mainstream media portrayed the protests as street violence
and public opinion continued to be manipulated by the government. In the
meantime, political magazines that were sharply critical of the government
became popular. 
<P>
      In 1986, the Green Team, an underground video group began to
record faithfully social protest events and produced and distributed video
tapes. Their work caused people to understand the opposition movement in a
different light. Between 1987 and 1988, home videos produced by the Green
Team and The 3rd Vision bore witness to major protest events in a social
movement that marked the turning point of Taiwan's development toward
democratization. 
<P>
      In 1990, the Green Team established an underground television
station to counter the pro-government election campaign invariably staged
by the three TV stations. Others attempted to interrupt official
television broadcast. Mobile underground television stations also joined
in the movement against KMT control over mass media. 
<P>
      By 1991, there were 300 cable TV stations in Taiwan, all of them
illegal because cable was banned. In 1991, the opposition party, DPP,
began to broadcast political speeches, reports of social unrest and
political discussion programs on cable TV channels. Such channels were
called " Democracy CTV". They began to produce news reports on local
events to counter centralized control over news by the 3 televisions
stations. This marked the beginning of community TV news in Taiwan.
However, such efforts were still short of the spirit of a true community
TV because they lacked community participation in program production. In
1993, the government was finally forced to legalize cable TV. 
<P>
      Also, in 1994, underground radio stations sprang up and became the
focus of attention. These stations opened hot lines for call-ins, enabling
taxi drivers, home makers and other listeners to become street
commentators on political events and social issues. The immediacy of
call-in dialogues inspired popular participation and brought forth
opinions that had been systematically silenced by radio stations that
receive official blessing. More importantly, underground radio became a
means of mass mobilization and a point of conflict that sharpened people's
awareness of the inseparable ties between free speech and democracy. On
August 1, 1994, the KMT government used helicopters and a police force of
six thousand to crack down simultaneously on all 14 underground radio
stations in Taiwan. The early morning attack provoked mass protests and a
riot in the capital city of Taipei. Some stations resumed broadcast almost
instantly and received large sums of money from supportive listeners. The
crackdown only confirmed the martial law mentality of the KMT and its fear
of free speech. 
<P>
      Since 1986, people who pursue freedom of speech have waged a
continous war against government control over the media. Their protests
have been carried out in the margins of society, in the form of
distribution of underground video tapes, TV broadcast interference,
opposition cable TV or underground radio broadcast. The war has been waged
against centralized control by KMT over the mass media, against official
suppression of the people's will to free expression. Such is the scene in
which the electronic media in Taiwan moves slowly but surely towards
democratization.
