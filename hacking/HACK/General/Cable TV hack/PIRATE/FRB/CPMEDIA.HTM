<P> 
      Perhaps the most blatant betrayal of our freedom came during this
century when the Federal Communications Commission, charged with
regulating the use of our airways, instead delivered them to corporate
America. What I am saying is simple and frightening: An agency of the
United States government, the FCC, effectively transformed our airways
into commodities and handed them over to the corporate entities that
exploit us. Left with no means by which to engage in communication with
each other, we became estranged, ineffective, and at last impotent. We
became a people without thoughts of our own, without ideas, without values
or viewpoints of our own to be shared with each other in the fullfillment
of the democratic dream. Instead, we, ourselves, became commodities to be
sold in the media's marketplace. 
<P>
      I say we, too, were marketed. When we sit down to watch what
purports to be the evening news we are being sold. We are an audience with
a high value. Every program, from football to MTV, gathers its specific
audience in the same way that the fisherman nets perch or halibut or
salmon, depending on the market's demand. As fish in the net, we are sold
to the advertisers as so many hundreds of thousands of middle-aged
persons, or kids, or teenagers, or the affluent. We no longer speak back. 
We no longer speak to each other. We no longer speak at all. We are only
silent. Silent listeners. And as water washes the rocks smooth and at last
wears them away, so, too, our brains are washed into intellectual
oblivion.  With an evil magic, the brain washing transforms our children
from the bright, the inquiring and the creative to mindless consumers, to
empty headed shoppers concerned chiefly with things, and the means by
which to acquire things. The brain washing turns our children into things
for sale, things in the pursuit of things, things chasing dollars and the
things dollars will purchase. The brainwashing has dehumanized us. It has
left us comporting ourselves like lurepen slobs drooling at the trough
where we are slopped like anthropomorphic hogs with the vacuous fare
corporate America throws at us. 
<P>
      The FCC could have, indeed, had the duty to make the airways
available to a wide variety of interests that represent a free citizenry.
The airways should have been assigned to television stations controlled by
labor, by blacks, by women, by environmentalists, by small businesspeople,
by educators, by farmers, by workers, in short, by the American people.
Instead, without considerations--free--the FCC gave our airways to three
mammoth corporations who now own them as their private property and, with
other networks that have since come into existence, perfect the
redesigning of our minds into those of the perfect consumer. Our minds
have also been reformed to adopt a single virulent philosophy, a supposed
wisdomsthat to prosper, Americans must support the dribble down theory of
the New King, that to survive, Americans must abdicate their power to the
corporate conglomerate. 
<P>
    The FCC, itself a hopelessly entangled bureaucracy, one ultimately
controlled by the gargantuan corporations it seeks to regulate, has
repeatedly proven it can not exercise its power to preserve our rights. In
fact, it no longer harbors any intent to do so. The corporations who own
the networks are too large, too powerful, too entwined into the power
structure to be controlled. ABC was swallowed up by Capital Cities
Communications. NBC was scooped up by General Electric when it purchased
NBC's parent, RCA. The FCC, itself, has become a part of the intimate
corporate family. Its members and functionaries pass back and forth
through the revolving door, today purportedly regulating the corporation,
tomorrow, as their reward for good and faithful service, occupying a posh
position in the very corporations they regulated yesterday. 
<P>
      Justice Brandeis in Whitney v.California said, "Those who won our
independence believed... that public discussion is a political duty," as,
indeed, it is. Justice Brennan in New York Times v. Sullivan said, "thus
we consider this case against the background of a profound national
commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be
uninhibited, robust, and wideopen ....  "But how can we perform our public
duty unless we control the means by which to communicate with each other?
Worse, how can we be free when we are constantly reeling under the
sedative of corporate propaganda? In retrospect, how could self government
have been so easily destroyed by the simple devise of delivering our
airways to the New King? 
<P>
      The First Amendment guarantees our free speech. By implication it
also guarantees the people's right to own and control the means by which
the people can speak to each other. One would not claim the ownership of a
useful interest in a car unless one also owned the wheels. Further, the
fact that our airways have been stolen from us these many years does not
eliminate our ownership of them. Time does not create a cure for an
original wrong. If we steal our neighbor's cow, we can not argue that
although we stole her, we nevertheless fed her for fifteen years, and,
therefore, she now belongs to us. 
<P>
      Equally Iamentable is the fact that that which has been stolen
from us has been thereafter served back to us in the lowest form yet
imaginable. It is as if our wheat has been stolen and we have been left to
choke in the chaff. In their defense, advertisers and network executives
contend that the American public is an unintelligent, unthinking, rustic
conglomerate of doits. "Look," they argue, "at what the people choose to
watch. "As one executive told me, "The viewers, themselves, demand the
garbage we feed them. If they demanded a different cuisine we would feed
that to them, as well." Another put it more succinctly: "We, in
television, rise to the highest level of our audience. The highest level
of our audience, unfortunately, is at the age of an average thirteen year
old."
<P>
      I do not dismiss so easily the intelligence, the taste, or the
wisdom of the American people. It is not the level of the people's
intelligence that limits us, but the constant barrage of insipid,
tasteless rubbish that is relentlessly dumped on us as if we live in the
bottom of an intellectual land fill. And how could it be otherwise for
advertisers? Most of the products hawked on television are utterly
irrelevant to the good life we seek.  Madison Avenue knows, of course,
that, in an intelligent environment, it cannot sell that which is patently
worthless. One is not as likely to buy sugar corn pops as a result of
watching a conference considering the health hazards of America's diet as
one is likely to buy the same cereal as a result of watching some empty
headed sit com. 
<P>
    I have tried too many cases before ordinary people sitting as jurors
without developing a profound respect for their inherent, collective
wisdom, their ability to absorb complicated facts, and their capacity to
there after come up with a just result. It is easy to put the American
public down. But those who believe that intelligence and taste, indeed,
wisdom, are traits reserved only for corporate moguls and Wall Street
bankers are the fools. People know. The collective intelligence of the
American citizenry is awesome if, after it is fully informed, it is given
a chance to honestly express itself. On the other hand, there is little
doubt that if our intellectual diet consists of that which is currently
offered on television, the old saying has relevance: "Garbage in_garbage
out."
<P>
      Television producers argue that people want to be entertained. Of
course. But that does not mean that people do not also want to be
enlightened, delighted, and uplifted, and it does not mean that people do
not want to be informed. Despite the myths of freedom that fog our clear
vision, in the basement of their minds the people know they are trapped. 
They know they are rarely told the whole truth. They know their vote
ultimately makes little difference. They know that they usually do not and
cannot get justice. If one knows that one's fervent striving makes little
difference and that the whole truth is a rarity, if one knows one is the
object of continuous exploitation from every quarter and is helpless to do
much about it, then entertainment is the answer, as escape and denial also
become the answers. 
<P>      I do not disrespect the intelligence of the people. I disrespect
those who have, by their own deep scorn and arrogance, so demeaned the
people for so long that the prophesy of the people's intellectual
impotence has often been fulfilled. But when we have taken back our power,
when we again control our airways and our voices can again be heard on
every major issue that effects our freedom, when we know that we truly
guide the ship of state, the character of the media will have also
changed. Then truth, then indepth analysis, then the presentation of facts
(no matter how complex), then responsibility, yes, then art, too, will
take precedent over the silly, the mundane, the false and the empty. Then,
with the repossession of our airways, the people will begin a new
adventure_the quest for the long awaited American dream.
