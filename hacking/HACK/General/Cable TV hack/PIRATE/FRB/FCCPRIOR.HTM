<H2>The FCC's Priorities:  Public or Profit?
</H2>
<P>
The Federal Communications Commission is supposed to make sure the 
airwaves are used in the public interest.  More often, it has ensured 
that they are used for corporate profit.
<P>
Questions of control of broadcast licenses rarely get rasied by the 
corporate-owned media.  Something of an exception occurred recently when 
two networks questioned each others' broadcasting licenses:  NBC alleged 
that Fox, owned by Ruper Murdoch's News Coporation, is a foreign-owned 
company and therefore under FCC rules should not be allowed to control 
U.S. staions; Fox retored that GE, which owns NBC, is a corporate felon - 
which could jeopardize NBC's own licenses. (See Extra!, 11-12/94).
<P>
Even this limited public debate over corporate control of broadcasting 
seems to be too much for the FCC.  "One source close to the case said FCC 
chairmen Reed Hundt thinks press coverage of this has become a circus," 
Daily Cariety (12/9/94) reported.  The FCC for a time imposed a gag order 
on the NAACP's pending challege to Fox's licenses on the grounds of 
foreign ownership.
<P>
But more rather than less coverage is needed of decisions involving who 
gets to control the airwaves, which - according to U.S. law - are owned 
by the public.  Otherwise, corporate interests' behind-the-scenes 
influence will prevail.  Well before the news broke of Newt Gingrich's 
$4.5 million offer from the Murdoch owned HarperCollins, Daily Variety 
(12/9/94) already noted that "Republicans in Congress may be ready to 
rally to Rupert Murdoch's rescue" by intervening with the FCC.  Rep. 
Mike Oxley (R-Ohio) has called for an end of restrictions on foreign 
control and even suggested that Fox should not be penalized even if it 
has been violating the law (Variety, 12/12/94).
<P>
The FCC has already granted Fox numerous favors, waiving restrictions on 
syndicating its shows, allowing Fox to broadcast into the U.S. from 
Mexican stations, and granting Murdoch a waiver allowing him to own a TV 
station (WNYW) and a newspaper (the New York Post) in the same market.
<P>
Meanwhile, the FCC is seriously considering easing limits on ownership 
(Variety, 12/19/94) - such as allowing networks to own an unlimited 
number of TV stations, as long as they don't reach more than 50 percent 
of the U.S. population.  (Currently, networks are limited to 12 stations 
and 25 percent of the population.)
<P>
While this deregulatory spree seems tailored to please the corporate 
broadcasters the FCC is supposed to be regulating, the agency is getting 
tough with at least one broadcaster:  The FCC is trying to silence Free 
Radion Berkeley, a 15-watt radion stations that operates without a 
license.  (The FCC will only grant a license to stations with 100 or more 
watts, putting broadcasting beyond the reach of most individuals.)  The 
FCC was particularly perturbed that Free Radio Berkeley founder Stephen 
Dunifer was teaching other people how to set up their own micro-watt 
radio stations (without interfering with other stations) for less than $1000.
