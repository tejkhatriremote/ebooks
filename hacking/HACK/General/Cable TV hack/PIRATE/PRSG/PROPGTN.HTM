Like I mentioned in the section on Frequencies, each part of
the spectrum acts "differently" depending on many variables of
natural conditions. Propagation is a fascinating science and can
be studied for many years without ever learning it all! This
section is intended ONLY as a rough guide and there are many
books that cover this subject in more detail. Should you wish to
learn more, look wherever radio books are sold!
<p>
  Rather than explain about such things as Sun Spots, 11 Year
Cycles, A & K Indexs, etc. I'm just going to outline general
propagation characteristics for each of our newly designated
pirate bands.
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+1><FONT COLOR=ORANGE><B>185, 87 and 74 Meters</FONT></FONT></B> - During the hours of daylight, reception
should be possible up to 200 miles. During the hours of darkness,
reception should be possible up to 1000 or more miles. During
years of low solar activity, long distance reception at night is
not uncommon. High static levels make reception difficult during
late spring, summer and early fall.
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+1><FONT COLOR=ORANGE><B>48, 43 and 41 Meters</FONT></FONT></B> - During the hours of daylight, reception
should be possible up to 1000 miles. During the hours of
darkness, reception should be possible up to several thousand
miles or more. During the Winter Dawn and Dusk periods it is
possible to have reception from the other side of the world, as
signals follow the darkness path. Late spring, summer and early
fall will contribute to higher static levels.
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+1><FONT COLOR=ORANGE><B>32 and 30 Meters</FONT></FONT></B> - During the hours of daylight, reception
should be possible up to 400 to 1500 miles. During the spring,
summer and fall seasons reception during the hours of darkness
should be possible up to several thousand miles. During the
winter months in the hours of darkness should produce only
marginal reception.
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+1><FONT COLOR=ORANGE><B>26 Meters</FONT></FONT></B> - During the hours of daylight reception should be
possible up to 500 and 2000 miles during the entire year. Longer
distances should be possible for a hour or two after local
sunrise and during late afternoon and early evening. During the
spring and summer reception should also be good during the hours
of darkness.
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+1><FONT COLOR=ORANGE><B>22 Meters</FONT></FONT></B> - During the hours of daylight reception should be
possible up to 600 and 1800 miles and increasingly further during
the winter season. During late afternoon, early evening and for
several hours around the sunrise period, reception should be
possible from 1000 miles to HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD! During the
summer months reception of very long distance can be expected
during the hours of darkness. During the peak years of solar
activity, this band will be "open" almost on a 24 hour basis.
During low solar activity, this band will
be "open" mainly during daylight hours and is especially good in
the dawn and dusk periods.
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+1><FONT COLOR=ORANGE><B>20 Meters</FONT></FONT></B> - The best reception will occur for an hour or two
after local sunrise and again during the late afternoon and early
evening.  Medium and short distance reception should be possible
during the daylight hours. During the summer season excellent
reception conditions may also extend well into the hours of
darkness. This band shows highly variable propagation depending
on the solar activity levels. During high sunspot years, this
band will be favorable to long distance reception almost 24 hours
a day. At mid levels, this band will produce the most favorable
reception during the daylight hours. Sporadic E type skip, single
hop up to 1300 miles and double hop up to 2600 miles, is common
during early summer and mid-winter.
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+1><FONT COLOR=ORANGE><B>14 Meters</FONT></FONT></B> - Primarily a daytime band. Conditions should be
optimal for long distance reception during the fall, winter and
spring seasons. During the summer season, reception will favor
North-South paths. Because of decreasing solar activity,
conditions on this band will be marginal.
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+1><FONT COLOR=ORANGE><B>11 Meters</FONT></FONT></B> - Primarily a daytime band. Conditions are more
dependent on high solar activity than any other band. Long
distance reception during the daylight hours should be possible
up to several thousand miles during the fall, winter and early
spring seasons. During equinoctial seasons, reception will favor
North-South paths. During the winter season, reception will favor
East-West paths. During the summer season, reception should be
possible from 800 to 1200 miles.
