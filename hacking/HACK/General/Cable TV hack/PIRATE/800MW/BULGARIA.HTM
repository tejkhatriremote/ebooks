DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MEDIA lN BULGARIA
</a></h1>
<address>Leigh Hall</address>
<p>
Like most post-communist countries Bulgaria is presently in a painful
transition time. The past, sheltered under the mighty USSR has vanished
irretrievably and the future is uncertain:  prosperity seems frustratingly out
of reach for the majority of people. Most Bulgarians, like people everywhere,
would prefer to be left alone by politicians and military leaders, to be
allowed to just live in peace and look after their families. To ignore politics
is luxury found only in long-stable countries. Those whose society is in flux
are forced to sometimes make hard decisions about what kind of country they
want to live in.<p>
<p>
The name Bulgaria comes from the word Bulgar. The Bulgars were a nomadic
central Asian people who in the seventh century conquered (and were
subsequently absorbed by) the resident Slavs in what is now present-day
Bulgaria. Bulgaria was later subjugated once again to Turks for nearly 500
years under the Ottoman Empire, but Bulgarians always maintained a very
separate national identity. Their Slavic language and Orthodox Christian faith
were distinctly different from Turkic speech or the Islamic religion (1).
Bulgarian philosophical orientation was always European, although the years
under Ottoman rule separa~ed them from European development. Iskra Baeva has
suggested that because the West Slavs adopted CathoIicism and feudalism, that
these institutions promoted the growth of a local aristocracy at the expense of
central state power. Whereas East Slavs, manning the border between Europe and
Asia, were frequently invaded by Mongols, Tartars, and Turks. Baeva daims that
this constant threat from the outside caused a forced centralization of power
in East Slavic political systems, limiting their understanding of the freedom
of individual consciousness. This centralization would in modem times work to
their disadvantage. In 1989 Bulgaria still had no organized dissidence or
tradition of developed civil<p>
thought to help fill the vacuum caused by the world collapse of (Soviet-backed)
Communism (2). Like most changes in Bulgarian society the revolution was to
some extent imposed from above, by political elites eager to retain power
within a new social framework. <p>
<p>
Bulgarians did have some democratic tradition to fall back on. The first
Bulgarian constitution, written in the city of Turnovo in 1879, was based on
the ideals of the French Revolution. It protected the freedom of speech,
assembly, and the press. The main points of this constitution were very
enlightened, and it represented good intentions on the part of its framers,
even if the laws were not always adhered to. This constitution stood (with one
or two interruptions) until the Communist takeover in 1947(3). Bulgarian ties
with Russia (both tsarist and Soviet) were always extremely close, but by the
1980's the regime of Todor Zhivkov was paying less attention to the changes
taking place in Russia, than its own domestic agenda. The forced Bulgarization
of minority Turks finally erupted into bloody battles, as the Communist Party
attempted to deny the existence of non-Bulgarians in their country. This was at
about the same time when Gorbachev's new openness policy in Russia reached its
height. Zhivkov could not possibly have carried out his Bulgarization policies
(which forced Bulgaria into an isolated position politically) had he been
directly under Gorbachev's influence (4). Of course in the 1980's there was
still an unrestricted flow of printed media and television from Mother Russia,
but by then it was no longer limited to<p>
the predictable old Marxist/Leninist preaching. Bulgaria's first taste of
glasnost came from the USSR and was eagerly received by the populace, but
Bulgaria's old guard leaders stood firmly against it (5).<p>
<p>
The sweeping events of 1989 ousted the Zhivkov governrnent but not the
Communists/Socialists who retained power even after the first multi-party
elections in June of 1990. The umbrella reformist group UDF finally won a
narrow Parliamentary majority in October of 1991. But a year later, when the
Turkish MRF party (with 24 seats) decided to switch their allegiance from the
UDF to the socialist party, the new reformist government lost a Parliamentary
vote of no-confidence. The socialists formed a new cabinet in January of 1993
and rehired many old Communists (6). A month later the UDF basically comrnitted
political suicide by expelling seven of its own Parliamentary representatives
for allegedly being too supportive of the new government. This rash action
prompted another eleven UDF representatives to resign in protest, thus giving
the BSP a comfortable majority in the Parliament (7). For the past year and a
half the situation in Bulgaria seems to be that of a polarized Parliarnent
operating under a president and a prime rninister who have different agendas
and publicly distrust one another. New elections may have to be called as early
as September (8).<p>
<p>
It is not at all surprising that Communists could not qulckly voted` out of
public life in Bulgaria. Under Todor Zhivkov the ratio of actual Comrnunist
Party members to the general population was almost 13%. This was a higher
percentage than could be found even in the USSR at that time (9). The Xinhua
Ne,vs Agency (presumably Comrnunist Chinese and perhaps not necessarily totally
objective) carried a story this year about tens of thousands of Bulgarians
rallying for an impromptu, unofficial May Day celebration in Sofia (10). If
this is true, then certainly there seems to be a residual nostalgia for the
glory days of Cornmunism. The BSP may milk this emotion for political support,
but even they could not recreate the pre-1989 style of government if that was
the* goal. Political pluralism and private enterprise seem firmly established.
The BSP's top priority is limited to the protection of struggling state
industries and slowing of privatization (11).<p>
<p>
The communist system did at least offer the security of COMECON markets where
one could buy and sell without hard currency. That was a very different
situation than today's global market, which is more open and competitive than
ever before. Since the Bulgarian economy is not yet up to EC standards for
membership, Bulgaria has joined the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Zone to find
open markets. The Black Sea free-trade zone was established in 1992 after the
collapse ofthe USSR to recreate trade contacts between the region's market
economies (Turkey and Greece) and the former communist economies (Russia,
Ul~aine, Romaoia, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, and Bulgaria).
Together they have established a trade and development bank (based on the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) in order to finance badly
needed infrastructure in these countries such as energy production and
telecommunications (12).<p>
<p>
Modern telecommunications is a key element in t ansforming Bulgarian society
and media. The European Development Bank is currently financing the
construction of a $29 million fiber optic telephone cable which will stretch
under the Black Sea from Romania to Turkey by way of Bulgaria. More than twenty
leading international tdecommunications companies (including AT&amp;T, MCL
British Telecom, Deutsche Bundespost, and Swiss Telecom) have requested to be
allowed to buy a 70% stake in the cable (13). Reliable phone service is one of
the most basic requirements to run an efficient modern business. According to a
poll conducted by the International Telecommunications Union (Geneva), Bulgaria
has one of the worst phone services in the world, with 3/4 of all calls made
there failing to go through (14). Sprint Corp. has a joint venture with the
state-owned telecommunications monopoly to help provide computer and phone
services (15). Siemens has been awarded a contract to supply 80,000 digital
phone lines in Sofia and Varna (16). UK-based Cable &amp; Wireless opened a
cellular phone franchise, holding a 49% stake in it. The cellular network
covers Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna? and Burgas and should cover up to 95% of the
country by 1998. After two years the management of the franchise will revert to
the Bulgarians. C&amp;W claim they plan to stay in Bulgaria long term and to
invest locally all profits made there for the first three or four years (17).
The EU in March also began a telecommunications training program there to
instruct Bulgarians about types of governmental regulations, managing a
telecommunications company, marketing, sales, and new technology (18).<p>
<p>
Some computer companies have opened local offices. Compaq has 38 dealers in
Bulgaria and helped to computerize the Bulgarian National Parliament (19). The
US Library of Congress and a House task force also provided technical support
on that project (20). Intel GmbH has opened offices in Eastern Europe and sells
in Bulgaria (21). McGraw-Hill last month announced plans to publish a Bulgarian
language edition of the computer magazine BYTE (to appear in October).
McGraw-Hill claimed their decision was based on the fact that Bulgaria was the
primaly center for development and production of computers to the former USSR
Bulgarian language editions of Apple News and Computer News are already in
publication (22). David Worlock, head of the European Information Industry
Association, claimed last December that Bulgaria already had one of the best
developed, networked information services in Europe (23).<p>
<p>
Many academics and journalists in the West rely on the Internet to receive and
spread information farther and more quickly than was ever before possible. The
Internet Society recently held a hands-on workshop in Prague for Eastern
European students. Financier and philanthropist George Soros paid for many
individuals to take part. Mr. Soros has also used his money to support Internet
links in Bulgaria, claiming that this kind of computer networking can help
break down barriers within (as well as between) countries (24). <p>
<p>
MCI has also sponsored Bulgarian librarians working in the field of
environmental studies to go to the Prague conference . These librarians are
part of a special project created to share scientific and management
information through an Internet directory service call the EcoDirectory. This
is aimed at helping environmentalists from former East Bloc countries get the
up-to-date information they need to begin to plan how to repair the complex
environmental problems left by decades of political and industrial
mismanagement (25). <p>
<p>
Of course, use of the Internet requires literacy in English (or at the very
least an acquaintance with the Latin alphabet) and the use of mostly American
software. Thus it is hardly a waste of time for US technology firms to promote
it. Although it is unquestionably to the advantage of relatively isolated
people to learn to communicate with the world outside of them, it should be
kept in mind that the probable motivation of American businesses in Eastern
Europe is to develop consumer markets there for American products. This may be
fine and well but their teachings therefore may not always be objective and
geared toward the real information needs of their eager East European
students.<p>
<p>
Even if one assumes improved access to advanced technology, another problem
Bulgarian journalists have is that of credibility with discerning readers
(viewers, or listeners). Those reporters who staff the new, independent press
are frequently former political activists from before the revolution, and
although enthusiastic, lack professional training. Not uncommonly they fail to
understand the distinction between their former role and their current one. So
eager are they to publish the "truth" of their society, that they print stories
which are collaborated, highly slanted, or published anonymously (26).
Journalists who work for the old state-run radio and TV<p>
have the same credibility problems they have always had: no one trusts the
mouthpiece of the government.<p>
<p>
Bulgarian journalists are beginning to understand the gravity of this problem.
The Balkan Press Center has been established (with some European funding) to
promote professional behavior and has held seminars on democracy and media, and
chauvinism and media (27). The Bulgarian Parliament has asked the Association
of European Journalists to help draw up some guidelines on objectivity (28).
The USIA and VOA are supporting professional journalism training in Sofia (29).
The two year old American University in Blagoevgrad was established to fill the
perceived need for advanced study in new subjects like business management,
sales, computer science, law, and Western-style objective journalism (30). The
Journalism school at Sofia University has unfortunately shown no change in
curriculum or focus since communist time (31). The American-based Freedom Forum
has also opened a reference news library in Blagoevgrad to give Bulgarian
journalists access to up-to-date information, reference works, and CD-ROM
databases (32). <p>
<p>
With more mass access to current global information, there can be no question
of any meaningful political censorship. And especially now with anti-censorship
laws on the books Bulgarians can read, watch, or listen to anything they like,
as long as they can afford it. Of course for every nouveau riche entrepreneur
with a satellite dish in his backyard and a shiny new computer in the den,
there are hundreds of lesser mortals out in the provinces who still have access
only to state-run radio, TV, and some highly opinionated, sensationalist
newspapers. The free market is a bumpy ride for most Bulgarian media attempting
self-financing for the first time, and naturally some are more successful than
others. <p>
<p>
Of the news media, newspapers experienced the most dramatic unshackling in
1989. But as the costs of paper and printing quickly went up newspapers tended
to spring up and shut down almost overnight. Also, as elections and political
speeches lost their novelty, interest in them (inevitably?) waned and even the
(better financed) party newspapers' circulations have declined. Tabloids such
as 24 Chassa have done very well (33). Business weeklies apparently are
profitable. The Swiss publisher Ringier has begun publishing one (34) and
Reuters has also signed an investment agreement with another, Capital Press
(35).<p>
<p>
Most television and radio transmitters are still owned by the government and
private licensing requirements are complex. Six fully commercial radio stations
do now operate in Sofia and 41 radio licenses have been awarded throughout the
country (36). Britain's GWR Group Plc bought 30% of the radio station FM Plus
earlier this year (37), and a private Turkish language TV station has been
granted a permit, but it is not yet operational in Turkish. A Greek company,
Antenna TV, is negotiating to be allowed to broadcast into Bulgaria (38). Since
1990 a private French channel has beamed into Sofia and many Bulgarians can
still receive regular Russian, Greek, or Yugoslav channels (depending of course
on where they live) (39). <p>
<p>
The continued lack of established media laws further slows the process of
granting permits. It is also possible that the Bulgarian Parliament is dragging
its feet deliberately, unwilling to relinquish hold of government-owned media
outlets. The 1991 Constitution entrusted media supervision to the Parliament
until appropriate laws could be written. The Parliamentary Commission in charge
of this has been very slow in formulating these laws, claiming to be studying a
variety of examples of media law from all over Europe (40). In the meantime the
staff of Radio Sofia has remained unchanged from pre-1989, while the staff (and
political ideology) at Bulgarian Television changes frequently, depending on
who is in power (41).<p>
<p>
One European convention the Parliament was quick to adopt was the idea of the
Value Added Tax. The Bulgarian version of this, which went into effect April
1st, does not exempt newspapers, magazines, books, advertising, ink, printing
services, or films from its 18% rate. The impending VAT prompted a four day
general strike by Bulgaria's leading newspapers and private radio stations. In
sympathy with the strikers Sofia's theaters showed only pornographic movies.
Sofia Films claims the high tax rate will drive Hollywood and family films from
the screen since the Bulgarian lev (to buy tickets) is declining and energy
prices (to run the cinemas) are going up (42). The Confederation of Independent
Trade Unions in Bulgaria, the Union of Bulgarian Journalists, and the
Association of Private Radio Stations are demanding exemptions from the VAT.
Commercials and advertising which are obviously a source of major funding for
private media will be heavily hit by VAT. Eighteen percent is higher than the
press rate of VAT for any other European country (43).<p>
<p>
It is significant to note that the state-funded radio and television stations,
which presumably will not be affected, did not strike. It is easy to jump to
the conclusion that since VAT will harm the consumption of private media, that
this new tax was a government strategy to support the dominance of its own
stations. However, given the Bulgarian budget deficit of 14.7% GDP (1993
figures not available) (44), perhaps one should not be too quick to assume that
a high VAT rate is a blatant attempt by the Parliament to muzzle private media.
This might be a factor, but probably it is also the understandable desire to
raise federal revenues during a difficult financial time. <p>
<p>
Aside from the usual financial woes, minority printed media in Bulgaria has
experienced a dramatic reversal of fortunes from the bad old days of the
1980's. The Communist government was especially hard on the highly visible
Turks, and among other violent abuses, closed down their schools and
newspapers, causing many Bulgarian Turks to flee into Turkey (45). Today
Turkish and other foreign language papers (published abroad or domestically)
circulate freely (46).<p>
<p>
This is no doubt helped by the fact that for the first time in years the
political relationship between Bulgaria and Turkey is very good. Bulgarian
President Zhelu Zhelev claims that minority Turks can now take part in national
government and bear responsibility for it. There is also free movement of
people across the Bulgarian-Turkish border (47). Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel also claims to no longer have any special concerns about the Turkish
minority in Bulgaria. He adds that the improved trade between the two countries
will benefit all citizens, minorities included (48). Much of this goodwill
undoubtedly comes from the desire that the new<p>
Black Sea Economic Zone develop smoothly-and receive the maximum foreign
investment. <p>
<p>
The Bulgarian Turks themselves still seem to have some complaints about their
situation. In March of 1993 the MRF made a demand for at least 12 hours of
Turkish language TV programming per day on state-run TV (49). Less than two
months later the BBC carried a story about illegal transmitters and relay
facilities operating in southeastern Bulgaria. These transmitters were
broadcasting Turkish satellite programs on the same frequency as Bulgarian
National Television (which had yet to provide for any Turkish programs). This
was in clear violation of the law, but apparently the money to set up the
transmitters had been raised by the mayors of several predominately Turkish
towns in this area (50). A license was finally granted for a privately run
Turkish language channel but that is as far as it has gotten. It has been
suggested that by allowing for a privately funded Turkish station, the
Bulgarian government is neatly avoiding having to accede to MRF demands to
provide a separate state-run channel (51). In August of 1993 Bulgarian state
radio did finally begin some Turkish language broadcasts (52). <p>
<p>
Bulgaria's Gypsies have not fared as well as her Turks. There is no political
party to publicize Gypsy grievances, and none can be established due to a
constitutional ban on parties based on ethnicity or religion. There exist two
national Gypsy organizations, the Confederation of Roma in Bulgaria, formed in
May of 1993, and the Associated Roma Union, founded in October of 1992. Without
parliamentary representation it is of course far more difficult to legislate
Gypsy rights. But some reforms have been put into place. Romani dialects are
now taught in some elementary schools, and the Bulgarian government has
announced plans to try to recruit Gypsies into the police force (53).
Unfortunately the police are still very frequently accused of harassment and
beating of Gypsies (54), so Gypsy police would be a step in the right
direction. The US Department of State reported last year that the housing
allotted to Gypsies was very poor (frequently without water, electricity, or
sewers), that Gypsy clubs and neighborhoods are frequently attacked, that
Gypsies are denied standard Bulgarian social benefits, and that the media
attributes crime to Gypsies without proof (55). The Roma Union claims that
Gypsies are not politically represented and in fact are manipulated by
non-Gypsy political parties and the media (56). The Consolidated Romani Union
in May announced that it was withdrawing its support from the party because of
disappointment with their unfulfilled promises. They claim they will now back
the far more conservative Bulgarian Socialist Party (57).<p>
<p>
Although much of the Bulgarian media is still dependent on state or party
funding, blatant censorship does not seem to be a problem. Foreign
government-sponsored radio programs such as the BBC and VOA now have
unrestricted access to commercial radio frequencies. And even though Bulgarian
Television is still state-controlled, Bulgarian opinion polls rate TV as the
most credible news source (58) That interesting fact could be a comment on the
polarized political views of the press media, but they also at least can
operate with governmental interference. Two years ago the UDF daily Demokratzia
published a top secret report dated Aug. 20 1968, and concerning the deployment
of 1,800 troops into Czechoslovakia (59). Of course this might have just been
an attempt by the UDF to embarrass the former Communists. But it was an open
discussion of a sensitive topic and must have caused the Bulgarian people some
pain and embarrassment. Regardless of the awkwardness caused, this is one of
the functions of a free press, to occasionally act as a nation's conscience,
showing them the truth when many would prefer to pretend as if it never
happened.<p>
<p>
This acceptance of journalistic honesty certainly could not be found under
Todor Zhivkov's reign. There was a famous incident in London in 1978,
concerning a Bulgarian emigre who was working there as a broadcaster for the
BBC World Service. Georgi Markov had fled Bulgaria nine years before and was
broadcasting anti-Communist propaganda from London back into his homeland. He
was murdered on Waterloo Bridge by a jab from a poisoned umbrella, apparently
wielded by a Bulgarian assassin sent by Zhivkov himself (60). This is
admittedly an extreme example of Bulgarian state censorship, not widely
practiced. <p>
<p>
The new laws on censorship are just one example of Bulgaria's post-communist
legal code. The current Bulgarian constitution was adopted in July of 1991 by
the (BSP-dominated) National Assembly. At that time some of the UDF
representatives who wanted more far-reaching legal changes codified, protested
by going on a ten day hunger strike. They wanted stronger laws protecting human
rights and routing Communism (61). The constitutional clause mentioned earlier,
prohibiting the establishment of ethnic or religious political parties, is a
controversial one. CSCE countries (including the US) and Western human rights
groups point out that ethnic minorities are frequently discriminated against,
and that this is a difficult situation to rectify without organized political
representation. The Bulgarian government counters this argument with their
not-unrealistic fear of a potentially explosive division of their country along
racial tines. The breakup of neighbor Yugoslavia from these tensions has
certainly not gone unnoticed in Sofia. It is hard to say whether minimizing the
injustices suffered by minorities is in the long term more stabilizing, than
allowing attention to be focussed on these complaints, which might lead to
demands for more and more autonomy. The UDF party has pledged to try to amend
this constitutional clause but it will require a two-thirds parliamentary
majority (which they do not have)(62).        <p>
<p>
Last March the representatives of the American-based Central and East European
Law Initiative traveled to Bulgaria to help them review their new constitution,
especially in technical (and new) areas such as intellectual property laws,
commercial law, and bankruptcy (63). Only two weeks ago a new Western-style
copyright law finally took force. A special Department of Intellectual Property
will be created under the Ministry of Culture, and stiffer fines demanded for
infringements. Unfortunately these fines are still very low when compared to
the potential profit (64). <p>
<p>
Pirated Hollywood blockbusters are popular and immensely profitable After years
of being offered nothing but Bulgarian- (and Russian-) made films, people are
naturally now eager to immerse themselves in racier American movies. Action and
science fiction are particularly well- received and there are no restrictions
or regulations about the amount of graphic violence that may be seen on screen
(65). Since the U.S.A. produces a plethora of violent action films (with
gratuitous nudity), US imports would seem ideally suited to this growing
Bulgarian market. It is hard to say when, or if, Bulgarians will become jaded
with this coarse fare and begin to pay money to see more artistic or
thought-provoking films. Right now of course the novelty value is strong, but
the educational level of the average Bulgarian is fairly high and he might not
be satisfied with action movies for very long. Taste varies from culture to
culture, as well. The Japanese are a very culturally and industrially advanced
culture, but their films and reading material are commonly very violent and
sexual.<p>
<p>
In any event, the new Bulgarian copyright law might put a dent in the local
cinemas' booming business in American film. Over half of what they now show are
pirated film copies. There are claims that some US films are distributed
illegally in Bulgaria long before they open in the States (66). There is,
unfortunately, a long and respected tradition of samizdat in formerly communist
countries. This dates back to times when Western or subversive books and films
had to be copied and circulated secretly. Today there is the barrier of high
price instead of censorship. <p>
<p>
In contrast, the Bulgarian domestic film industry has also completely
collapsed. Suddenly in 1989 there was no more state money earmarked for them.
The Bulgarian film industry, like the computer industry, had been accustomed to
enjoying a great deal of investment and attention under communism. Todor
Zhivov's daughter had personally been in charge of  developing Bulgarian film
through the Ministry of Culture, and if the film had a socialist propaganda
value its makers lacked for nothing. The state-owned Boyana Studios are
equipped with modern lighting and cameras, and a few years ago employed 1,600
people. Boyana has Europe's most extensive stocks of wardrobe and props. There
sit "80,000 period costumes and workshops capable of producing everything from
prehistoric reptiles to replicas of medieval armor," (67) all now mostly
unused. After 1989 state funding plummeted to almost nothing, but the Bulgarian
low production costs have lured some foreigners to film in Sofia. US-Bulgarian
shooting of "Bird of Prey" began last May for 3.5 million dollars (68). A
comedy film festival is held in the city of Gabrovo (69), and Varna hosts the
"First International Film Festival" (70). <p>
<p>
At the moment Bulgarians seem eager for contact with the West and desirous of
modeling certain facets of their society on it, such as the legal system.
Whether these positive emotions can be sustained through a painful
restructuring of society (which most likely will displace a number of people)
cannot be known for sure at this time. No two countries develop in exactly the
same direction or at the same rate, so it is impossible to predict with
certainty Bulgaria's future. The "benefactors" in the West who are eager to
reshape her thinking and economic structure to be more like theirs, have, of
course, their own agendas. This is not necessarily ominous, but something for
Bulgarians to understand and keep in mind. Tabloids and action films can be
found in every country, certainly America cannot be judgmental in this area.
Their popularity is high and there is the danger that people will not be able
to tell the difference between what is enlightening and valuable, versus what
is not to be taken seriously. Many Western European countries also consider
their news media to be free of censorship even when much of it is nominally
state controlled. The difference of course is what forms that control takes,
and also whether the citizens see their government as something stable and
trustworthy, or something to be feared and battled. An uncomfortable gap
between rich and poor will probably also develop in Bulgaria. This will be
especially painful because the extent of the gap will be new. Probably only the
next generation will be able to look back and clearly see where the mistakes
were made in the transformation to a market economy and democratic system of
government. Some isolated but encouraging examples of success have been found
in the more Western former communist societies, but there is still no magic
formula that can be followed to assure a painless, straightforward transition
and quick prosperity for all.<p>
