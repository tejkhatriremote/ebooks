<h3>Power Meter/Dummy Load</h3>
</center>

<b>Two very</b> handy items to have when you are building and/or
adjusting your radio transmitter are the Power Meter and the Dummy Load.
A Power Meter for adjusting your transmitter for maximum power output and
a Dummy Load to appear as a perfect antenna and absorb the RF signal without
radiating a signal.  You may transmit all day long at any power level legally
as long is it is into a suitable Dummy Load.<p>
<b>By integrating</b> a power meter and a dummy load you will get very
accurate readings of your power output.  You must have a high-impedance
Voltage Ohm Meter to get accurate readings with the power meter shown
here.  A 20M ohm meter will work well.<p>
<b>The following</b> is the schematic for the combination Power
Meter/Dummy load.  You may use 1/4, 1/2, 1, or 2 watt carbon resistors
for R2 through R5.  Using 1/4 watt resistors the Dummy Load will be
able to handle up to a watt of output power for long periods of time and
2, 3 and up to 4 watts for shorter periods of time.  By using larger
load carring resistors you can expand the amount a power the Dummy
Load will handle without burning up.<p>

<b>To calculate</b> the power output of your transmitter while using this
device use the following formula:<p>
<ul>
<i><b>Power Output in Watts = (V*V) / 50</i></b>
</ul>
<b>Example if</b> you measure 2 volts on your voltage meter you output power would
be:<p>
<ul>
<i><b>Power Output = (2*2)/50 = 4/50 = .08 watts = 80mw</i></b>
</ul>
<br>
<b>This Power</b> Meter/Dummy Load is a perfect addition to any DIY
micro power radio station.<p>
