<b>Yeah, you </b> got it folks: It's me again with a little at-ti-tude for
all you out here in white-bread land, all you nice people living in the
middle of America the beautiful.<p>
<b>Let's see,</b> we're on 92 FM tonight and it feels like a nice, clean
little band so far.  No one else is using it and the price is right, heh-heh.
And yes folks, you've guessed it, tonight I'm as horny as a 10-peckered owl,
so stay tuned because this is Hard Harry reminding you to eat your cereal
with a fork and do your homework in the dark...<p><br>
<b>Send me</b> your most pathetic moment, your most anything, as long as
it's real.  I mean, I want the size, the shape, the feel, the smell.  I
want blood, sweat, and tears on these letters.  I want brains and
ectoplasm and cum spilled all over them.  Hallelujah!<p>
<b>And now,</b> all my horny listeners, get one hand free because, yes,
the <b><i>eat me beat me</i></b> lady is back:<p>
<ul>
"Come in. Every night you enter me like a criminal.  You break into my
brain, but you're no ordinary criminal.  You put your feet up, you
drink your can of Pepsi, you start to party,  you turn up my stereo.
Songs I've never heard, but I move anyway.  You get me crazy, I say
'Do it.'  I don't care what, just do it.  Jam me, jack me, push me,
pull me -talk hard!"<p>
</ul>
<b>I like</b> that.  talk hard.  I like the idea that a voice can just go
somewhere uninvited and just kind of hang out like a dirty thought in
a nice, clean mind.  To me a thought is like a virus [can you say meme?].
You know, it can just kill all the health thoughts and just take over.
That would be serious.<p>
<b>I know</b> that all of my horny listeners would love it if I would
call up the <b><i>eat me beat me</i></b> lady.  But no!  Because she
never encloses her number.  Always the same red paper, the same beautiful
black writing.  She's probably a lot like me- a legend in her own mind,
heh-heh.  But you know what, I bet in real life she's probably not that
wild.  I bet she's kind of shy like so many of us who briskly walk the
halls, pretending to be late for some class, pretending to be distracted.
Hey, poetry lady, are you really this cool?  Are you out there?  Are
you listening?  I feel like I know you, and yet we'll never meet.  Ah,
so be it...<p><br>
<b>Consider the</b> life of a teenager.  You have parents, teachers telling
you what to do.  You have movies, magazines, and TV telling you what to do.
But you <i>know</i> what you have to do, huh.  Your job, your purpose,
is to get accepted, get a cute girlfriend, and think up something great to
do the rest of your life.  What if you're confused and can't imagine a
career?  What if you're funny-looking and you can't get a girlfriend?  No
one wants to hear it, but the terrible secret is that being young is
sometimes less fun than being dead.  Suicide is wrong, but the interesting
thing about it is how uncomplicated it seems.  There you are, you got
all these problems swarming around your brain, and here is one simple,
one incredibly simple soluiton.  I'm just surprised it doesn't happen every
day around here.  No, now they're going to say I said offing yourself is
simple, but no, no, no, no, it's not simple.  There's no teachers, there's
no parents, but guess what?  There's nothing to do.  Fucking boring.  Another
thing to remember about suicide is that it is not a pretty picture.  First
of all, you shit your shorts you know.  So there you are dead, people are
weeping over you, crying, girls you never spoke to are saying, "Why? Why?
Why?" and you have a load in your shorts.  That's the way I see it.  Sue me.<p>
<b>Now, they're </b>saying I shouldn't think stuff like this.  They;re saying
somthing is wrong with me, that I should be ashamed.  Well, I'm sick of
being ashamed.  Aren't you?  I don't mind being dejected and rejected, but
I'm not gonna be ashamed about it.  At least pain is real.  You look around
and you see nothing is real, but the pain is real.  You know, even this show
isn't real.  This isn't me;  I'm using a voice disguiser.  I'm a phony fuck
just like my dad, just like anybody.  You see, the real me is just as worried
as the rest of you.  They say I'm disturbed, well of course I'm disturbed.
I mean we're all disturbed, and if we're not, why not?  Doesn't this blend
of blindness and blandness want to make you do something crazy?  Then
why not do somthing crazy?  It makes a hell of a lot more sense than blowing
your fucking brains out you know.  Go nuts, go crazy, get creative!  You
got problems?  You just chuck'em, nuke'em!  They think you're moody?  Make
'em think you're cazy, make 'em think you might snap!  They think you've got
an attitude?  You show'em some real attitude!  Come on, go nuts, get crazy.
Hey, no more Mr. Nice Guy.<p><br>
<b>I'm calling</b> for every kid to seize the air.  Steal it, it belongs to
you.  Speak out, they can't stop you.  Find your voice and use it.  Keep this
thing going.  Pick a name, go on the air.  It's your life, take charge of it.
Do it, try it, try anything.  Spill your guts out, say <i>shit</i> and
<i>fuck</i> a million times if you want to, but you decide.  Fill the air,
steal it. Keep the air alive.<p>
