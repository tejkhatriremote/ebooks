<h2>FCC and the LAW</h2>
</center>
<img align=right alt="FCC VAN" src="images/fcc.gif">
It is unclear in the law weather or not the FCC really has legal
jurisdiction over unlicensed broadcasters that broadcast signals
that don't cross state boundaries.  Most people give the FCC the
benefit of the doubt since they are a government agency and have
much  more ammunition than the average unlicensed broadcaster. 
Much like taxpayers and the IRS.  But as you shall see later the
FCC's jurisdiction may be resolved in the near future.
<p>


Unlicensed operation of transmitting devices is discussed in
"Part 15" of the FCC Rules.  These Rules are published in a
maximum of 100 "Parts,"  covering all aspects of
telecommunications.   A compleat set of these rules should be
available at your local Public Library.  If you have questions
about the legalities of operating any of the projects in this
book that are not covered here or are unclear, please consult
these Regulations.
<p>


Part 15 covers "wireless microphones" and "unlicensed broadcast
band" transmitters for a number of different frequencies.  
While Part 15 allows 100 milliwatts output power for unlicensed,
home-built transmitting devices, on the FM broadcast band your
allowable power output is measured in a different way.
<p>


On the FM broadcast band you are not allowed to transmit a
signal that would cause a field strength greater than 250
microvolts (uV) at a distance of 3 meters from the antenna.  You
may be asking yourself "what does this mean in real terms?"  The
answer is a difficult one to answer.  You could have transmitter
that generates 100mw running into one antenna that is legal and
have another transmitter that generates 10mw into another
antenna that is twice or more this legal limit.   This depends
mostly on how efficient your antenna and feedline are. 
<p>


It is the Authors opinion that these regulations regarding FM
broadcast band field strength could of been written by
Machiavelli himself.  Most of the "bugs", FM broadcaster kits,
and Mr. Microphones that are available on the open market today
can easily exceed these regulations.  To be able to follow this
regulation you would need a calibrated field strength meter that
could measure field strengths accurately down to about 100 uV,
and use it every time you broadcast, even with your Radio Shack
Mr. Microphone.
<p>


Other regulations for the FM broadcast band include :
<p>
<ul>
<li>The transmitter must NEVER be tuned to a frequency above 108
MHz.  FCC Rule 15.205 lists the frequency range between 108 to
121.94 as restricted, due to potential interference with
aircraft navigation equipment.
<br>
<li>The bandwidth (or amount of spectrum your transmission can
occupy) of your transmission is limited to 200 kHz centered on
the actual operating frequency.  This is plenty of room for a
stereo signal and several subcarriers.
<br>
<li>It is the sole responsibility of the builder-user of any FM
broadcast-band device to research and fully avoid any and all
interference to licensed FM broadcast transmission and reception.
<p>
</ul>

There is much more in the Part 15 Rules.  FM broadcast band
usage is specifically addressed in Rule No. 15.239.  Please
consult the rules for more info.

<h3>FCC and Reality</h3>

The FCC, at least at the time of the writing this, is
not a gestapo type government entity like the IRS.  Mostly they
are your typical government licensing agency concerned in what
is perceived the "greater good" for the "people" of our country.
They have no law enforcement ability by themselves and rely
mostly on enforcing there regulations by fines, usually to
licensed radio operations that could have there licence taken
away for failure to comply to regulations or pay fines. 
<p>


In the case of unlicensed broadcasters things get a little more
tricky.  The FCC's recourse is to take a fined unlicensed
broadcaster to civil court.  This rarely happens.  In most cases
the unlicensed broadcaster stops broadcasting and pays the fine
or broadcaster stops broadcasting and doesn't pay the fine.  In
the latter case the FCC rarely goes after the broadcaster for
the fine and the whole matter is dropped.
<p>


The FCC doesn't drive the streets at night looking for
unlicensed broadcasters.  In almost all cases the FCC will not
go after an unlicensed broadcaster unless there has been
complaints about the broadcaster.  Most of these complaints are
generated from licensed broadcasters.  Rarely does the FCC get
complaints that the unlicensed broadcaster is creating interfering.
There have also been a few cases where legitimate broadcasters complain
about unlicensed broadcasters because they were taking to many listeners
away.
<p>

The FCC does have vans that resemble small moterhomes that they
use for enforcement of there regulations, but these vans are
usually used for licensed enforcement.  For unlicensed
enforcement the FCC usually uses there specially modified
station wagons.  These cars have specially fitted fiberglass
roofs with antennas mounted in them.  Both the vans and the
cars, contrary to popular belief, usually have no antennas
hanging off them.  All the antennas are encased in the body or
in plastic containers on there roofs. 
<p>


<h3>FCC and Recent Busts</h3>

Since the micro power radio movement has been gaining lots of
momentum lately, there has been a corresponding number of people
served with "notices of apparent violation", which basically
mean "We (the FCC) know/think you are broadcasting illegally". 
The fines levied have been much higher than have been issued in
the past for unlicensed operation.
<p>


There has been one crowning difference between the most recent
"busts" an the older ones.  This is that the unlicensed
operators have been running high profile radio stations.  While
there has been many documented cases in t he past of college
students running for years with there low profile station
without a peep out of the FCC, these guys are thumbing there
noses at the FCC, the licensed broadcasters, and the government.
 High profile, media campaigns,  and anti-establishment
broadcasts are prevalent.  And like any government agency, the
FCC wants to make an example out of these broadcasters before
"more disruption" occurs.  In short they are trying to put the
cap back in the bottle before the genie gets out.
<p>

These high profile stations, Black Liberation Radio, KAPW, Free
Radio Berkeley and San Francisco Liberation Radio have lined up
to do battle with the FCC the all American way, with lawyers. 
It will be interesting to see if these suits will resolve any of
the questions about the FCC's jurisdiction, and the status of
unlicensed broadcasting.
