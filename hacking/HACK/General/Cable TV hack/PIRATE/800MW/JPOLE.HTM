<b>The J-Pole</b> antenna is fundamentally an end-fed 1/2-wavelength
antenna that uses a 1/4-wavelength long transformer section to
supply the very high feed voltage.  It is an ideal end-mounted,
single-mast antenna.  For 3-meters (FM broadcast band) it is probably
the antenna that is the best solution for many micro power radio stations.
It is cheap and easy to build, very sturdy, simple to tune up, and
performes quite well for 3-meter transmissions.
<p>
<b>The Antenna</b> shown is made from 1/2" copper tubing and it is
soldered togeather with plumbing tees, elbows, and nipples.  The
spacer under "B" is 3/4" plastic pipe cut to hold and re-enforce
the two copper pipes.  The coax (RG-8 or Equivilant) is affixed to
the pipe as shown with movable copper clamps.  The fully constructed
antenna is then clamped to a grounded metal pole.

<b>Section A</b>, the antenna radiator is 3/4-wavelength long, so its
dimension is found from:<p>
<ul><ul>
Section A = (8838/(frequency in MHz)) inches
</ul></ul><p>
... and the quarter wavelength matching section length from:<p>
<ul><ul>
Section C = (2952/frequency in MHz)) inches
</dl></dl><p>
<b>It may</b> wise to cut Section A longer by an inch or two to allow you
some leeway when it is time to tune it.  The distance D is around 5 inches
between the bottom of Section C to the copper clamp that is attached to
the outside braid of the coax.  The distance B (and corrisponding section
B) is 3 3/4 inches.  It is wise to cut section E to at least 3 feet if
not longer.<p>
<b>After cutting</b> all the sections solder togeather using a propane
torch and affixing the PVC pipe spacer.  Attach to a grounded metal pole
at its permanent home and attach the movable copper clamps that have
the RG-8 coax already attached (and 4 turn loop of coax affexed to top
antenna mount.)  Connect to a transmitter operating at your calculated
frequency with an SWR meter attached and take an SWR reading.  If SWR
is not desirable move the copper clamp that is attached to the center
wire of the coax up or down and re-take the SWR reading.  If the
SWR cannot be lowered to the desired reading you may have to cut or
lengthen the 3/4-wavelength radiator.  Shortening the antenna will
rade the resonate frequency.  It is possible to get a 1:1 reading with
this antenna.<p>
[The design for this antenna was taken from the <b>Practical Antenna
Handbook</b> by Joseph J. Carr and from a design for the FM broadcast
band by G. Forrest Cook WB0RIO.]
