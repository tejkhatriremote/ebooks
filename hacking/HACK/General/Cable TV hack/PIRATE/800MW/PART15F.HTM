<H2>Summary of the FCC part 15 Rules</h2>

Here is the summary of FCC part 15 rules, from the Ramsey FM-25 kit
manual. Paraphrased in parts. The usefull range of part 15 devices in
the FM broadcast band appears by this to be around 1/4 mi. Some of you
techno types can let us know if this is correct.
<p>
FCC Rule 15.239 specifically addresses operation in the 88__108 MHz
band. This rule by itself does not tell you everything you need to know
about using a device of this kind. Therefore we are noting a series of
Part 15 regulations which should be observed. 
<p>
The bandwidth allowed is 200 KHz. This is more than you need for a
standard FM stereo transmission.
<p>
FCC rule 15.215a says: "Unless otherwise stated, there are no
restrictions as to the types of operations permitted under these
sections." This general provision appears to leave you free to use your
FM stereo transmitter in a manner similar to operations of an FM
broadcasting station, or to use it for any other non-interfering,
practical application.
<p>
FCC Rule 15.5: General conditions of operation: "Operation is subject
to the conditions that no harmful interference is caused and that
interference must be accepted that may be caused by the operation of an
authorized radio station, by another intentional or unintentonal
radiator, by industrial, scientific and medical epuipment, or by an
incedental radiator. The operator of a radio frequency device shall be
required to cease operating the device upon notification by a
Commission representative that the device is causing harmful
interference."
<p>
FCC Rule 15.239: The field strength of the signal must not exceed 250
microvolts/meter at a distance of 3 meters from the transmitter. The
field strength is determined by the antenna, as well as transmitter
power. In this instance, the antenna is a simple 3 meter element. 
<p>
In all cases the field strength of a signal decreases in direct
proportion to the distance away from the antenna. Power decreases by
the square of the distance: for every doubling in distance, the signal
power is quartered, but the field strength voltage is only halved.
Using this theory, we can construct a simple chart to show the maximum
permitted performance of a non licensed FM band transmitter. The
theoretical figures assume a simple 1 meter recieving antenna in all
cases, and do not take into consideration that reception can be greatly
enhanced with larger, multi-element antennas and preanplifiers. In the
following chart, the field strength gets even stronger as you move from
the edge of these circular boundaries toward the antenna.
<p>
<pre>
Distance from transmitter (feet)      field strength (uV)
10					250
20					125
39					63	
78					31	
157					15	
315					7.5
630					3.8
1260					1.9
2520					.95
5036					.5
</pre>

The most significant distance in the above chart is the 1.9 uV signal
stregth permissable at 1260 feet. (about 1/4 mile). A look at stereo FM
receiver specifications shows typical sensitivity of 1.7 uV.
