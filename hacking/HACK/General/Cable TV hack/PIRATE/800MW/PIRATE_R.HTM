<h2>Pirate Radio Is Here</h2>

<b>FROM THE OUTER REACHES</b> of radio dials in Santa Cruz, pirate radio is 
beginning to make its voice heard.  Bob Marley songs popped up intermittently 
on the airwaves in the last two weeks, marking a testing period for an illegal 
station that may come to be known as Free Radio Santa Cruz.  Regular 
programming could commence as soon as the end of this month.<p>

Behind the new station is a group of social activists with ties to similar 
stations in the Bay Area.  Like its brethren to the north, the new Santa Cruz 
station will champion the right to freedom of speech, organizers said.<p>

``The idea is to give a voice to the voiceless,'' said Tom Schreiner, who has 
helped coordinate the effort.  The station will broadcast at 89.3 FM, barring 
a change in plans.<p>

Schreiner and his colleagues hope to pattern the new station after
Free Radio Berkeley and illegal stations
in San Francisco that address volatile political issues such as
homelessness.<p>

Notwithstanding programmers' best intentions, the Federal Communications 
Commission expressly prohibits the operation of transmitters without proper 
licensing.  Violators are subject to a $10,000 fine and loss of broadcasting 
equipment.  Vowing to defy the FCC, organizers argue they are only exercising 
their First Amendment rights.<p>

``The movement is around people having their own vision,'' said
Stephen Dunifer, who operates Free Radio
Berkeley and is a key figure in the recent proliferation of pirate stations.  
``Whether or not the FCC is willing to accommodate that, it's still going to 
happen.''  Dunifer manufactured the
transmitter that is to be used in Santa Cruz.<p>

<h3>Inexpensive access</h3>

The development of low-cost ``micro-watt'' transmitters with ranges of 5-10 
miles has opened up the airwaves to anyone with an interest in broadcasting 
and a relatively small amount of money.  The start-up cost for a traditional 
radio station can be $100,000 or more, but a micro-watt station can go on the 
air for less than $1,000, according to Dunifer.<p>

Dunifer, Schreiner and others believe
that the spread of micro-watt stations will eventually force the FCC to modify 
its regulations.  ``Mostly the idea is to propagate so many of these that they 
just have to give up and accept it as a fact of life.'' said Schreiner.  
``That's essentially what's happening.''<p>

The FCC is not alone in objecting to pirate stations.  Established radio 
stations also perceive pirates as a threat because illegal transmissions can 
drown out legitimate ones.  KSCO owner Michael Zwerling denounced pirates as 
``arrogant'' and ``dangerous'' and said if the FCC allowed them free access to 
the airwaves, chaos would result.<p>

``The reason to have the FCC controlling radio stations is because the laws of 
physics are just that -- laws.  There's just a certain amount of spectrum 
available,'' said Zwerling.  ``I disagree with the FCC on a lot of issues, but 
that's not one of them.  I still think there should be very strong penalties 
for those who violate the rules.''<p>

But commercial, and even public radio stations do not speak for everyone, 
particularly in Santa Cruz.  Some of those involved in bringing pirate radio 
here believe it is the only way to combat the political status quo in this 
country.<p>

Pirate radio provides a way to mobilize the community against rampant 
corruption and censorship, said Tom Reveille, a veteran pirate broadcaster who 
donated $1,000 to finance the Santa Cruz station.  ``I believe there is a war 
going on.  The first thing you do in a military action is get hold of a means 
of communication,'' said Reveille.<br>
