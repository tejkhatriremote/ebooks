<h2> 1.2 Watt Bullet Proof Amp For The FM-10 or FM-25 </h2>
<h4>By Mycal</h4>
</center>
<hr>
<b> The follwing </b> is a very easy to build amplifier that was designed
to follow a Ramsey FM-10 and FM-25 transmitter.  It is built on top of
a simple PCB board surface style (all parts tacked on top, no holes in
PCB.)  The performance is excellent with power levels of up to 1.5 watts
achevable and harmonic suppression greater than 50db.  Using this
amp in conjunction with an Ramsey FM-10/25 can provide you with the ideal
micro power radio station with usable range of up to 2 miles or more.
If you use this unit to amplify a Ramsey FM-25, build the FM-25 in the
low power output configuration.
<p>
<b> I feel </b> this is a much better alternative than the Ramsey LPA-1
because it provides much lower harmonic output and it is relitivly
 <i> bullet proof </i> to antenna mismatches which has been known to destroy
LPA-1s without the slightest warning.
<p>
<b> The PCB </b> board is a single sided copper board etched or grinded out
to the shown layout.  The board size is 3 3/8" x 1 3/8" but anything close
that can accomidate the parts without any lengthing of the lead lengths
is fine.
<p>
<b> I recommend </b> that if you don't have a good way to make the PCB that
you buy the Radio Shack PCB Etching Kit, this kit works very well for
this type of application.  We've used laser printer iron ons for this
board, but we've found that electrical tape or the resist pens work
fine.
<p>
<h3> Design and Schematic: </h3>
<b> The amplifier </b> is a 2 stage design.  The first stage uses a high gain
microwave transistor amplifier running class-A to boost a 10mw signal
to about 150mw.
<p>
<b> In the </b> first stage the resistor R1 (1.5K) gives Q1
(mpf-901 or mrf-901) and the Ramsey
transmitter a nice stable input/output load to look at that should
smooth out missmatches between the transmitter and the amp (note that
this type of matching is only workable at flea power levels.. < 50mw.)
R2 (20K) provides the bias voltage making the amp class-A.  Current is
fed to the stage through R3 (300ohms) with a ferrite bead on the power
side to help keep RF out of the power grid.  An inductor of 1uh or better
can be substituted if a ferrite bead cannot be found (use only small
resistor type inductors, not giant monsters from <i>Radio Shack</i>).
The first stage is isolated from the interstage maching circuit by
C12 (.001).
<p>
<b> Intra-stage </b> matching is done by C1, C2, and L1.  This
network trys to match the output impeadance of the first stage with
the input impeadance of the second stage.  It also provides a little
bit of filtering.  It should be noted here that the power output of
the first stage affects it's output impeadance which is effected by
the input power level.  Any change in power outputs of the transmitter
(most likly from frequency or power supply change) will require
re-tuning of this amplifier.
<p>
The second amplifier is running Class-C pushing it's output into
the output matching circuit made up of C3,C4 and L2.  The output
is fairly clean and can drive an antenna or another stage.

<h3> Construction Tips: </h3>
Solder all the small low lying parts first; resistors, L3, L4, L5, L6.
Then mount all the small capacitors; C5-C10, and C12.  Next Q1,
C1,C2,C3,C4, followed by L1, L2 and Q2.  Finally add C11 and attache
the input and output with coax to the connectors and/or transmitter.
<p>
<h3> Part's Layout: </h3>
<img src="1watt.gif">

<b> For tune </b> up you should simply tune C1, C2, C3, C4 and L1 for maximum
output.  This amplifier doesn't like to ocsillate, but this is always
a possiblility.  You can check for oscillation by tuning a FM radio
up and down the FM radio band, if you hear multiple images of your
broadcast your amplifier is in oscillation (not good).
<p>
<h3> Updates and Modifications </h3>
<b> I would </b> change the design slightly if I were to build more of these
amplifiers.  The input is not DC isolated.  I would add a .001uh
cap between the input and Q1.  This is a must do mod if the amp is
to be used as a stand alone device (ie not hardwared ont a FM-10).
<p>
<b> I would </b> get rid of C12, it is not necessary since C2 blocks
the DC between stages.  I would move C1 to the other side of C3,
this allows C2 to be adjusted without effecting the C1/L1 low
pass filter.  I would add another 5-50pf cap from the input side
of L2 to ground, thus adding an extra element and more flexibility
to the output/matching filter (<i>I would and have done this addition
on every amp that I have built, cannout get -50db down on harmonics
without it.</i>)
<p>
<b> The modifications </b> listed above can easly be made to the existing
circuit board if done during the assembly stage.  Basically you
would shift Q1 and its associated parts one pad to the right
on the circuit board (since C12 is no longer necessary), and
add a .001uf cap between the first pad and the base of Q1 pad.
C1 can easly be moved to the pad on the output side of C2.  And
another 5-50pf variable cap fits nicely on the input side of L2.
<p>
<b> L6 mostlikly </b> can be optimized, but is most likely not that critical
to the overall performace of the amp.
