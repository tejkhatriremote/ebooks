<h2>FM-25 Info.</h2>

<br>
<b>Ramsey</b> trying to go to the next level with it's FM xmitter kits
has released the FM-25.  It is a true synthisized stereo FM broadcast
transmitter.  It offers frequency stability not obtainable with
inductor/capacitor free running oscilator based circuits like the
FM-10 and others.  The FM-25 has an export power option that brings it's
output power to about 80mw and the FM-25 is very easy to build
even though the part count is high.  Once again Ramsey has done a great
construction manual, the strongest part of both the FM-10 and FM-25 kits.
<p>
<b>The</b> FM-25 does have some shortcommings.  The output power is too great
for the final RF amplifier stage.  The supplied power supply and case are
a little better than junk.  Some of the circuit can be slightly modified
for greater performace in both output power and sound quality.  Soon
I will be exploring solutions to some of these problems.  John Ramsey
was kind enough to demo me a kit, and I'll be tweeking on it more
shortly.<p>

Simple things that seem to make a big difference:
<p>
<ul>
<li> First mount the thing in a nice metal box, this makes all the
        differnace in the world, exspecially if you are going to run
        an amp.
<li> Replace D6, D7 and D8 with a 3.1 voltage regulator made up
        with a LM723 or simalar.
<li> Insert 1 to 10 uh coils between R14 and Q2, also between R17 and
        Q3.
</ul>
