	Tired of selective and biased coverage of the news in your
area?  Bored with the same old top-40 radio stations?  Tired of
tuning up and down the FM band to find something worthwhile? 
Ready to take matters into your own hands, but don't have an
extra $100,000 to finance your own radio station?  Have no fear,
the micro-power radio movement is here, and it's time for you to
get involved!
<p>
	Micro-power radio has been called "freecasting," "pirate
radio," and more recently, "sandbox radio."  Throughout Europe
and Africa, it has played an important part in informing and
entertaining the public with alternatives not available from
government-controlled media sources.  Now in the United States,
micro radio is becoming increasingly important.  Large
corporations are buying up every last independent broadcast
media outlets and pressuring the government to increase
regulations to keep new players out of the game.  This has
stifled alternative thought on the airwaves.
<p>
	Micro-power radio is true community radio because its signal
only reaches a small geographic are.    Depending on the power
output, a micro-power station can reach from 1/4 of a mile to 10
miles or more.  Coverage could be an apartment complex, a
college campus, or a small town.  And because of the capture
effect of FM  and the low power of micro-power broadcasts,
another micro-power station in a neighboring community
broadcasting on the same frequency would cause little
interference.  Micro radio is to commercial radio as newsletters
are to slick magazines.
<p>

<h3>Is It Legal?</h3>

        Well...no, if you want to be technical about it.  The FCC
tightened up its licensing requirements in 1980 because of the
lobbing efforts of commercial broadcasters and The Corporation
for Public Broadcasting (your 'public radio' friends at NPR). 
Since then, the minimum price to get on the air has risen to
$50,000--not counting operating expenses.  These costs make
broadcasting too expensive for individuals.  Micro-power has
changed all that: a compleat station can be assembled for a few
hundred dollars, or a bare-bones station for less than a hundred.
<p>
	One goal of the micro-power movement is to force the FCC to
reinstate low-power radio licenses.  Similar actions in Europe
and Canada have been successful: Canada now issues micro-power
licenses; Italy has totally deregulated radio, permitting anyone
with a transmitter to broadcast; and England now allows
non-government stations.  All these gains were made by
micro-power stations and their ever-increasing listenership.
<p>
	Groups like San Francisco Liberation Radio and Free Radio
Berkeley have been running high-profile stations, openly
challenging the FCC to take them to court.  So far the FCC has
done little but file notices of apparent violations.  In
Springfield, Illinois, Black Liberation Radio has been
broadcasting for five years, 3 of them after the FCC fined the
station $750 (which has not been paid).
<p>
	Many other micro-power stations have been running for years
with little interference from the FCC.  Not to say that the FCC
doesn't frown on these broadcasts; but in most cases, they won't
go after a micro-power broadcaster unless there has been a
complaint, usually about interference with commercial stations. 
The micro-power movement stresses careful consideration when
selecting a broadcast frequency, along with care to use only
equipment producing "clean" signals.
<p>

<h3>Roll Your Own Radio</h3>

Radio can be better with micro-power radio stations that serve a
community, not a 200-mile region.  Get involved!  Here's a brief
explanation of what you'll need to start your own micro-power
radio station:
<p>
<ul>
<li>A group of committed people who get along well and have plenty of
time and energy.
<li>A format (presuming you have somthing worth saying.)
<li>A site to transmit from.
<li>A Frequency that is on an open FM channel.
<li>A transmitter built from kits, homebrew, or aquired on the surplus market.
<li>An antenna built or modified to work on the FM Broadcast band.
<li>Misc odds and ends to tie things togeather.
</ul>
	One person could operate a micro-power station alone--but the
time and effort to produce a show, setup the equipment, and do
the actual broadcast requires lots of work.  Having a small
group of like-minded people greatly enhances the operation of
the station, offering more ideas for programming and more hands
for equipment setup/teardown.  Also, the ream effort required to
put together a radio show is on of the reasons that chaos
doesn't break out on the airwaves!
<p>
	Find a site.  If you're broadcasting a powerful signal (or
worry the politicos in your area won't appreciate your
denouncing them as fascists), you may want to select a place
that offers a fast getaway.  A dormitory roof or any other high
location works great for micro stations, but even antennas
mounted to wooden poles jammed outside of a window have been
known to work.  A broadcast site must offer convenience, central
location to your listenership--and protection from the FCC, if
necessary.
<p>
	Before your first broadcast, find an open space on the
airwaves.  On the FM band, channels are spaced every 200kHz,
from 87.9 MHz to 107.9 MHz.  (You'll notice on most digital
tuners that the frequency changes by jumps of 200kHz.  For
example : 87.9 MHz will become 88.1 MHz when the 'up' button is
pressed.)  Care must be taken not to broadcast above 108MHz;
this space is used by aircraft, and you could cause a safety
risk if you interfere with aircraft communication.  In the best
of worlds, you would want at least one clear channel between the
frequency you choose and the next station.  In most urban
centers, this is impossible.  Best bets are the channels that
lie between 87.9 and 92.1 Mhz--but be careful not to broadcast
over faint, low power commercial or public stations.
<p>
	Hardest to find will be the transmitter.  Although it's
possible to buy an old FM transmitter from the pre-1980 legal
micro-power days, you'll probably have to build your own.  Don't
worry: it's not as hard as it sounds.  Several companies produce
kits based on the BA1404 monolithic FM stereo transmitter chips.
These kits are very simple to assemble and produce high quality
stereo signals.
<p>
	Antennas are one of the easiest pieces to acquire or build, 
but are also the items most micro-power radio operators skimp
on.  Big mistake!  The antenna is one of the most important
parts of the station.  With a poor antenna, your range will be
limited and you risk interfering with other stations, even if
all your other equipment is very high quality.  Antennas for FM
micro-power radio stations can be made out of a couple pieces of
wire, adapted from amateur radio antennas, or purchased outright
from your local Radio Shack.  Read up: the ARRL Handbook (also
known as the amateur radio bible) contains everything you'll
want to know about antennas--and just about every thing else
technically involved in a micro-power radio station.  Highly
recommended!
<p>
	There are a few other things you will probably need for your
station:  a soldering iron; basic knowledge of electronics to
assemble the transmitter; a power source (a car battery or a CB
radio power supply works great); an SWR meter to measure how
much power your transmitter is producing and reaching your
antenna; and a good digital receiver or a frequency counter to
ensure your transmitter stays at the right frequency.  And of
course, audio source (tape deck and/or mixer and microphone), wire,
audio patch cords, and coaxial cables to connect everything together.
<p>
	That is basically all you need to get on the air and take back
the airwaves from the giant megacorps.  Read up and turn on your
own micro-power radio cannon.  With micro-power radio, you can
score a victory for truth and liberty, without censorship or
control.  And don't forget the killer music.
