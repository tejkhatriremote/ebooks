Back in 1986, in a town called Chico in Northern California some
of my friends [Which included members of Group 42!] and
I ran a low powered FM Radio Station off and
on for about 6 months.  It was called <b>Dirty Boy Radio</b> and
was billed as subsiderary of Dirty Boy Productions (responseble
for many major and minor parties over several years.)
<p>
We ran mostly on Thursday, Friday and Saturday (the weekend in
Chico.)  The station was live about 40% of the time and on tape
60% of the time.
<p>
The transmitter we used was a FM mono transmitter with about
three and a half watts of output power.  The transmitter was a
homebrew design based on a MC1648 VCO running into a 3 stage amplifier
chain.   The amplifirers in the 3 stage chain were all running Class-A
with low Q tanks for broadband operation.  A filter was made from
a length of coax.
<p>
For an antenna, we used a halfwave horizontal di-pole, a center feed
virtical di-pole, and a j-pole at different times depending on where
the transmitter was living.  We had our best coverage with our 1/2 wave
horizontal (or close to horizontal) dipole that we had strung a good
150 feet up a couple of trees.  With the other antennas they were
no more than 30 feet above the ground.  [<i>Show above right is
