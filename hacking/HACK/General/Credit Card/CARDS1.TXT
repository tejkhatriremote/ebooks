    [ yeah fellow phreaks is the only way to find them by trashing, ]
    [                                                               ]
    [  ok now that i know where to find them how can i tell if it   ]
    [  has a good credit rating or not?                             ]
    [                                                               ]
    [ well this can be simply done by using a merchant number..     ]
    [                                                               ]

    [ the merchant number is a usually a 2 or 6 digit code that is  ]
    [given to the merchant (retailer) by the credit c.bureu itself. ]
    [                                                               ]
    [  you can hack this merchant numbers very easily, they are     ]
    [ usually close to one another: sample 567980  567985 ect ect.. ]
    [                                                               ]
    [          ok but where do i call to hack them?                 ]
    [                                                               ]
    [      either you can scan for them or ask around..             ]
    [                                                               ]
    [    ok so now that ive got the dial-up and mercahnt number     ]
    [    what else do i need?                                       ]
    [                                                               ]
    [  you need the bank's identification number to gain access,    ]
    [ you might want to try and hack it out, they are usually 2-4   ]
    [ digits..                                                      ]
    [                                                               ]
    [   ok so lets say ive got all the things needed..now what?     ]
    [                                                               ]
    [  now you are ready to check the card..ok so dial the dial-up  ]
    [ wait for the computer to answer, most computers answer with   ]
    [ the enter type message: in this case enter 10 for visa and    ]
    [                                            20 for master card ]
    [  now you will be ask for the bank identification, next you'll ]
    [ be ask to enter the merchant number, now you will be prompt to]
    [ enter the credit card number, now you will be ask to enter the]
    [ amount of money you would like to use on this card..and than  ]
    [ it will say please wait..and give you a message saying approve]
    [ 0029371 or you might get this kind of message; declined! ect..]
    [                                                               ]
    [    ok so what do those numbers after approved mean and        ]
    [    what is declined?                                          ]
    [                                                               ]
    [ well those numbers are the authorization numbers that the merc]
    [ hant (retailer) writes down to collect the money later on, so ]
    [ those numbers dont have any use for you the carder..          ]
    [                                                               ]
    [  declined is that; the card is either expired or that it does ]
    [ not have the credit for that amount of money.                 ]
    [                                                               ]
    [   ok so lets say the card was approved for that amount of     ]
    [  money, now what do i do?                                     ]
    [                                                               ]
    [  well you can start by trying to find that name in the credit ]
    [ card (carbon paper) in your local phone directory..           ]
    [                                                               ]
    [  ok so i found the name ..but what the hell does the phone    ]
    [ directory has to do with carding?                             ]
    [                                                               ]
    [  well is a must having the persons address and phone number.  ]
    [ in todays world 1988 its a must having the address because    ]
    [ most companies will check for that and if it doesn't match    ]
    [ the adress you are sending it to; they will suspect of credit ]
    [ card fraud, so if this happens what they will do is call the  ]
    [ number you gaved them to verify it..i would suggest giving    ]
    [ them a number that is busy most of the time by the way make   ]
    [ sure the area code ya give matches your state but dont ever   ]
    [ give out the owner of the cards phone number to any company.. ]
    [                                                               ]
    [   ok so why is it a must to have the person's number than?    ]
    [                                                               ]
    [  a very good question..you need the number to call the owner  ]
    [ of the credit card, yeah that's right to call him. you must   ]
    [ call the person ofcourse you must call him after ordering all ]
    [ the merchandise you want..                                    ]
    [                                                               ]
    [       ok so how do i do it without getting busted?            ]
    [                                                               ]
    [  well first of all find an extender or do it on a public phone]
    [ this will ensure safety from being traced, than you must call ]
    [ the company you will be ordering from through the extender..  ]
    [ anyways after getting off the phone with the company give them]
    [ a call back like in 3-4 hours and said something like this. hi]
    [ im calling concernign my order,i would like to know if it was ]
    [ shipped;i must have it by tommorow no later..anyways they will]
    [ check it for you and if they say yes it has been sent out sir!]
    [ or no it has not yet been shipped but it has been proccess..  ]
    [ than say ok thanks alot..now hung-up wait about an hour or so ]
    [ and call the owner of the credit card and say something like; ]
    [ hi, may i please speak to (name) dont say his last name just  ]
    [ first name, and say like hi, this is john/mary from the comput]
    [ er store, i was wondering if you have receive a call from one ]
    [ our representatives concerning some computer hardware..ect..  ]
    [ donot mention anything about credit card..anyways if he does  ]
    [ not seem to know what the hell you are talking about, you've  ]
    [ got it made..so tell him something like this is this (name)   ]
    [ (and any last name that comes to your mind) im speaking to, he]
    [ will ofcourse say no you have a wrong number so hung up and   ]
    [ that is it..you can be sure that you will get the hardware..  ]
    [ with nothing to worry about but please make sure you know what]
    [ the hell you are reading before doing anything that will get  ]
    [ you into more trouble than what you already are by reading    ]
    [ this file..                                                   ]
    [                                                               ]
    [  ok everything sounds great but what is an extender and where ]
    [ or how can i find one, is an extender really neccessary, what ]
    [ is the purpose of the extender?                               ]
    [                                                               ]
    [  an extender is a number you call and gives you a dial tone.  ]
    [ with this dial tone you could call out other numbers that are ]
    [ local to the area it is located at or you can call 800 numbers]
    [ and 950's since they are all free calls..                     ]
    [                                                               ]
    [   finding extenders wont be an easy task but you can do it    ]
    [  by scanning for dial tones..                                 ]
    [                                                               ]
    [  the extender serves a great purpose, it will protect you from]
    [ being traced..ok lets say that the company you are going to   ]
    [ order from has a tracer on its line..(doubtful but possible), ]
    [ so when you call the company through the extender they wont   ]
    [ trace you they will trace the extender..                      ]
    [                                                               ]
    [  ok what if i found and extender what do i do than, and how   ]
    [ can they trace the extender when im the one that is making    ]
    [ the call?                                                     ]
    [                                                               ]
    [   well when you get the extender simply dial a 9 plus the     ]
    [ number you wish to call..                                     ]
    [                                                               ]
    [  yes you are right, you are making the call, but you are not  ]
    [ making the call on your line you are making the call on the   ]
    [ extender which is another number not yours, so if they would  ]
    [ trace you they will have the extender number not yours..      ]
    [                                                               ]
    [  ok so can they somehow backtrace to the extander, how safe is]
    [ an extender and which kinds of extenders are there?           ]
    [                                                               ]
    [  extenders are not monitor but than again the extender might  ]
    [ have been abused and yes it might have a tracer on it..what i ]
    [ mean by abused is that it might have been has traced so many  ]
    [times that authoritiesities might have put a tracer on it like.]
    [                                                               ]
    [  an extender is the safest thing there has ever existed in    ]
    [  phone fraud..                                                ]
    [                                                               ]
    [  basically there are 3 type  of extenders but since this is   ]
    [  getting a little bit out of carding i will not discuss it..  ]
    [                                                               ]
    [ is always good to use extenders that  start with the number 2 ]
    [ although its not really neccessary..                          ]
    [                                                               ]
    [ ok so ive got all the tools but where do i send the cargo to? ]
    [                                                               ]
    [    well you must find and empty house that is not near yours  ]
    [  this will ensure safety, in case someone comes by and starts ]
    [  asking the neighbors all kinds of questions..                ]
    [                                                               ]
    [ ok so lets say i have order what i need ive call the company  ]
    [ back in 3-4 hours after hunging up with them, and i have ask  ]
    [ them if the merchandise was already shipped and they had said ]
    [ yes..ok so i called the owner about an hour later of finding  ]
    [ out that the merchandise was shipped or processed..now how    ]
    [ would i receive the merchandise what will i have to do?       ]
    [                                                               ]
    [ there are only 2 options either be there and face the ups, ex ]
    [ press mail and give him some excuse like hey im glad i caught ]
    [ you we are presently moving out or we just finished moving out]
    [ a while ago..do you have a packge for (name on card)-(give him]
    [ the complete name)..ect..thank him and go home happy.....     ]

    [     yeah but isn't it risky to sign in person?                ]
    [                                                               ]
    [  no its not risky of you are old enough to look like the owner]
    [ of the card..but if you arent than just leave a note on the   ]
    [ door saying to please leave it there..                        ]
