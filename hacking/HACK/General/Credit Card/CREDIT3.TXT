REVISED: 07/11/86


  The Dropsite
  ------------

      You must find a place for all
of these "goodies" to go.  If you
really wanted to get in deep, you might
have them sent to your house.  You
may also have a crude enemy in mind.
Stop and think of the benifits from
this suggestion.

      To get a sufficient drop, you 
have to find a deserted house.  It
must look like it is lived in though,
grass mowed, drapes, ect.  When you
are ready to order this stuff, have it
sent overnight UPS and leave a note
on the door saying that you work
acquard hours and to leave it on the
back porch.  This is really the best
way to do it, but I will tell you 
about a few others.

      U-Haul has what is called "Rent
a Spot".  Anything sent to this "spot",
U-Haul has to sign for.  You and only
you can get anything sent there.  You
might be able to send the "goodies"
there and then cancell the "spot"
after they arrive.  This is very
tricky and I would not recomend it, but
then again, there may not be a vacant
house where you live.

      This drop is just a house
with people in it you do not know and
who would not recognize you if seen
again.  Just have the packages sent
there.  Phone and tell them that you
ordered a package and it was sent to 
the wrong house.  Tell them that you
will pick it up when sometime after
it arrives if they don't mind.  I
strongly disencourage this method.

      Another drop could be any video
or computer retail store.  Here is a
little dialog that might explain this
a little better:

You:  Hi, this is David Lightman.  I
am interested in your new Sanyo
computer system.  I would like to talk
to someone about this.

Worker:  Sure.  Let me tell you all
about it.

(For the text on Sanyo, please write
them.  I am too lazy)

(Continued)

You:  Well, it sounds like just what I
have been looking for.  Could I buy it
now with my Visa and have my nephew
pick it up later?  I am sick and can't
get out.

Worker:  Sure.  I guess so.

ect. ect. ect... 

   You just pick up the package later
by telling the guy your name and what
you need to get.  Free shit.  Already
paid for.


  Ordering Mechandise
  -------------------

     Don't try this if you have a high
voice!  One exception to this though,
you might want to fake it like a lady.

     Some of the best places to get
stuff from is advertizements in
magazines.  When you do this, try to 
schedual it at the begining of the
month, after the bills have been
sent.  This will provide you for more
time for unexpected misshaps that
might occur.  You must be sure that
this is going to work, or just pull
out imediately!  When you call the
merchant, try to make it at night or
late in the day.  Most operators are
very tired then and not really
thinking of what they are doing.  Make
sure you know exactly it is you want
and everything about card by memory if
asked.

     When you finally get your
packages, completely forget where the
drop was, for you will NEVER want to
use the same one again.


     One more thing, the insurance
companies pay for all stolen goods
gotten by credit cards.


          A word of caution:

  Many a hacker have died this way...
