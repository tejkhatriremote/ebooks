         -] CREDIT CARD FRAUD [- 
 
         THE DO'S AND THE DONT'S.Kp 
                WRITTEN BY

    REMEMBER THE TIME THAT YOU SAW THAT NEW PIECE OF HARDWARE COME OUT FOR 
YOUR COMPUTER, BUT THE PRICE IS INSANE, OR YOU ARE THINKING OF BECOMING 
A SYSOP AND HAVE NO HA:dDRIVE. WELL I HAVE A SOLVE FOR ALL THE CLEVER PEOPLE 
THAT HAVE NO MORALS OUT THERE. IT IS CALLED CREDIT CARD FRAUD,  THE STAKES 
ARE HIGH BUT 'THE ENDS JUSTIFY THE MEANS'. AFTER READING MY FIVE STEP METHOD 
YOU CAN GET ITEMS YOU WANT WITHOUT SPENDING YOUR MONEY. 
 
 
STEP 1: GETTING THE NUMBERS. 
 
        THIS IS USUALLY VERY EASY. AS YOU KNOW AT STORES WHEN A PERSON WITH A 
CREDIT CARD BUYS ANYTHING THE STORE MUST HAVE A COPY OF THE CARD NUMBER, AND 
NAME AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT ON YOUR AVERAGE CREDIT CARD. MOST STORES COPY THE
CARD WITH A STAMP MACHINE AND A PIECE OF CARBON PAPER SO THAT A DUPLICATE OF 
THE CARD IS NOW ON A PIECE OF PAPER THAT THE STORE USES AND THE STORES 
USUALLYTHROW OUT THESE 'USELESS' CARBONS IN THE TRASH. WELL GUESS WHAT, THATS
WHERE TO LOOK FIRST. 
 
WHAT STORES TRASH TO LOOK IN. 
    A BIG DEPARTMENT STORE IS USUALLY THE BEST PLACE BUT IT IS A VERY BIG PAIN 
IN THE ASS WHEN THE STORE HAS ITS OWN CREDIT CARDS. THESE ARE THE STORES THAT 
I KNOWN HAVE THERE OWN CREDIT CARD: GIMBLES, LORD AND TAYLOR, MACYS AND BROOKS 
BROTHERS. WHEN GETTING THESE CARBONS DO NOT JUST STUFF THEM IN YOUR POCKET FOR 
WHEN THEY ARE WRINKLED THEY BECOME VERY VERY HARD TO READ. 
 
STEP 2: RECOGNIZING WHAT CARD YOU HAVE 
 
  SAMPLE CARDS 
 
  [SAMPLE: AMERICAN EXPRESS] 
 
      XXXX XXXXXX XXXXX 
 
      MM/Y1 THRU MM/Y2       Y1 
       JOHN DOE                  AX 
 
EXPLINATION: 
   THE FIRST DATE IS THE DATE THE PERSON GOT THE CARD, THE SECOND DATE IS THE  
 
 EXPRIATION DATE, AFTER THE EXPIRATION DATE IS THE SAME DIGITS IN THE FIRST 
YEAR. THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GOLD HAS MANY MORE NUMBERS (I THINK 6 8 THEN 8). 
IF YOU DO FIND A GOLD CARD KEEP IT FOR IT HAS A $5000.00 BACKUP EVEN WHEN THE 
GUY HAS NO MONEY! 
 [SAMPLE: MASTER CARD] 
 
   5XXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
   XXXX AAA DD-MM-YY MM/YY   JOHN DOE. 
EXPLINATION: 
    THE FORMAT VARIES, I HAVE NEVER SEEM A CARD THAT DID NOT START WITH A 
5XXXTHERE IS ANOTHER 4 DIGITS ON THE NEXT LINE THAT IS SOMETIMES ASKED FOR 
WHEN ORDERING STUFF, (AND RARELY A 3 DIGIT LETTER COMBO (E. ANB). THE FIRST
DATE IS THE DATE THE PERSON GOT THE CARD AND THE SECOND DATE IS THE EXPIRATION
DATE. 
MASTER CARD IS ALMOST ALWAYS ACCEPTED AT STORES. 
[SAMPLE: VISA] 
 
   XXXX XXX(X) XXX(X) XXX(X) 
   MM/YY    MM/YY*VISA 
   JOHN DOE 
EXPLINATION: 
    VISA IS THE MOST STRAIGHT FORWARD OF THE CARDS, FOR IT HAS THE NAME RIGHT 
ON THE CARD ITSELF, AGAIN THE FIRST DATE IS THE DATE HE GOT THE CARD AND THE 
SECOND IS THE EXPIRATION DATE. (SOMETIMES THE FIRST DATE IS LEFT OUT). THE 
NUMBERS CAN EATHER BE 4 3 3 3 OR 4 4 4 4. VISA IS ALSO ALMOST ALWAYS ACCEPTED 
AT STORES.  
 
STEP 3:TESTING CREDIT: 
 
     IF YOU WANT TO SEE IF A CARD IS A KNOWN STOLEN CARD OR SOMETIMES EVEN  
JUST TO SEE IF IT HAS CASH IN IT, THERE ARE NUMBERS THAT STORES CALL TO FIND 
THIS INFORMATION. MOST STORES HAVE THE NUMBERS WRITE NEXT TO THE PHONE OR 
WHERE THEY STAMP THE CREDIT CARDS. THE PLACE YOU CALL WILL ALSO NEED 
MERCHANT NUMBER. THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR MOST OF THE STORES HAVE THAT POSTED 
IN THE OPEN. ANOTHER METHOD OF FINDING THESE NUMBERS IS JUST TO WAIT TILL THEY 
CALL WATCH THE NUMBERS THEY DIAL AND LISTEN TO THE NUMBER THEY SPIT OUT. 
ONCE YOU CALL THIS PLACE YOU CAN ASK IF SO AND SO CREDIT CARD IS CLEAR FOR 
$500.00 OR ANY AMOUNT YOU WANT. THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THIS IF THE PERSON  
CLEARS FOR $500.00 THEN THEY SUBTRACT IT FROM HIS CREDIT, THUS ASSUMING THAT 
THE STORE SOLD HIM 500.00 OF STUFF... YOU CAN GET AROUND THIS BY TRYING TO  
CANCEL THIS WRITE AFTER SHE GIVES YOU THE CREDIT INFO, SOME OF THE OPERATORS 
WILL ALLOW THIS OTHERS SAY 'SORRY BUT I AM NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT'.THESE 
PLACES SERVICE ALL CREDIT CARDS SO IT MAKES IT VERY EASY ON VERIFING 
MANY CARDS. 
 
STEP 4: THE DROP 
 
ONCE YOU HAVE THE CARDS AND CLEARENCE. 
   YOU MUST FIND A DROP (PLACE TO HAVE THE PACKAGE SENT). THERE ARE MANY  
PLACES TO HAVE A DROP. NEVER USE THE SAME DROP MORE THE ONCE. HERE ARE THE 
TYPICAL DROPS. 
 
AN EMPTY HOUSE IS A GREAT DROP FOR IT INVOLVES LESS PEOPLE. IF YOU SEND THE  
PACKAGE UPS SIMPLE LEAVE A NOTE ON THE DOOR SAYING. 'SORRY I WORK DAYS FROM 
8 UNTILL 6 AT NIGHT COULD YOU PLEASE LEAVE THIS ON THE BACK DOOR STEP.'THIS IS 
A VERY EFFECTIVE DROP. YOU CAN FIND EMPTY HOUSES BY THE DOZEN FROM 
YOUR LOCAL REAL ESTATE AGENT (SAY YOU JUST WANT TO LOOK). 
    RENT A SPOT, U-HAUL HAS THESE RENT A SPACE TYPE THING WHERE THEY WILL SIGN 
FOR ANY PACKAGES GOING TO THE SPACE. END YOUR RENTED STOP AFTER THE PACKAGE 
COMES. 
 
    ANOTHER EFFECTIVE DROP IS A NORMAL HOUSE WITH PEOPLE IT THAT YOU DO NOT  
KNOW. YOU JUST CALL A DAY A HEAD OF TIME AND SAY 'YES, A STORE SENT A 
PACKAGE TO ME AND GOT THE WRONG ADDRESS, IT WAS ALREADY SENT... I WAS  
WONDERING WEATHER YOU COULD PICK UP THE PACKAGE FOR ME AND I WILL GET IT 
LATER, THANK YOU VERY MUCH'THIS WORKS VERY WELL. 
 
STEP 5: BULLSHITING THE PLACE INTO BELIEVING YOU ARE A VAILD CARD HOLDER. 
 
   THE BEST STORES TO DO THIS FROM ARE THE KIND THAT YOU ORDER FROM A MAGAZINE 
 
(E.G. INCIDER/A+/PC). WHEN YOU ORDER WITH CREDIT CARDS DO THIS IN THE BEGINING 
OF THE MONTH NOT AT THE END BECAUSE THE BILLS COMES AT THE END OF THE 
MONTH, WHICH GIVES YOU MORE TIME TO TAKE PRECATIONS.CALL LATER IN THE DAY OR 
NIGHT HOURS, (IF THEY HAVE THEM) FOR MOST STORE GUYS ARE TIRED THEN AND THINGS 
ARE USUALLY BETTER. KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU WISH TO BUY BEFORE YOU ORDER IT, MAKE
SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO SPELL THE NAME ON THE CARD IF HE ASKS. DONT BE LIKE 
'UMMM AAAA LE'ME LOOK'. CAUSE THAT WILL BE QUITE BAD FOR YOUR CREDIBLILTY. DONT
ORDER IF YOUR VOICE IS VERY HIGH BECAUSE MOST LITTLE BOYS DO NOT HAVE CREDIT 
CARDS! HAVE IT SENT UPS OVERNIGHT AIR IF YOU WISH, BECAUSE REMEMBER YOU ARE 
NOT PAYING A CENT! SOUND CONFIDENT, AND HAVE YOUR CARD IN FRONT OF YOU SO THAT 
ANY QUESTIONS CAN BE ANSWERED VERY QUICKLY. A WORD OF ADVISE, DONT POST CARDS 
ON BBS, BECAUSE FIRST IT GETS THE SYSOP IN A LOT OF TROUBLE, AND THE CARDS ARE 
SEEN BY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO SEE THEM. (THE FORMER MORE IMPORTANT 
THEN THE LATTER) 
 
           HAVE FUN, 
        BUT BE REASONABLE.... 
PS: THE INSURANCE COMPANIES PAY FOR ALL STOLEN GOODS GOTTEN BY CREDIT CARDS.
