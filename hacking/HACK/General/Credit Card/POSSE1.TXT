               PREFACE
     
     I have read many text files on the carding and I have found that none of
them really capture the full essence of the carding chain.  I found that the
majority of textfiles contain most of the same info in different words.  I have 
put my personal methods and experimenting in here along with the traditional
things.  I hope that this file helps you *LEARN* about carding. 
   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
     
                    I.  Introduction
     
     I'll skip all the bullshit and get to the facts...  Credit Card fraud is
simply using someone else's credit card to buy shit for yourself.  Enough
said!!
     There are many ways to use a cc such as ordering by mail, getting cash
from Western Union, Order and go pick it up, etc.  The possibilities are
endless.  This file concentrates on the mail order aspect of carding. 

     Before you start you should consider the risks:  Contrary to popular
belief cc fraud is relatively safe.  I'm sure you've never heard  anywhere in 
the  media that a person was caught and sent to jail because there aren't many. 
But for everyone that's caught, there are twenty people who get away with
it.  They don't publicize it because everyone would do it.  Now consider the
possibilities that there are...  Just about anything that you could want
you can get illegally.

     And for all you dudes that are scared of the *FEDS*, realize this:  Feds
have other more important things to do than waste their time trying to bust
a guy that's carding a watch a house that is targeted as a dropsite when
there are real criminals out there!
     
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
     
                    II.  Getting Card
     
     There are a couple of good ways to get cards...
     
1.   Trashing

     Trashing is simply going to a stores trash bins to get Credit card
transaction carbons.  I suggest that you hit the trash after a big holiday like
Christmas or something like that.  You can get enough in one day to last three
months.  This can get messy and I prefer to use other means of attaining card
numbers.
     
2.   Raiding Mailboxes

     The advantage you have with mail boxing is you get the cc bill with the
account number, billing address and credit limit but not the exp. date.  The
expiration date is not necessary, if you don't believe me, substitute 6/92.
Go to a condo complex or the like and walk casually to the doors and
pretend to look for a friends place while opening mailboxes.  Look for
anything with a return address of a bank (ie. Citibank, First National,
Comerica).
     
3.   Inside Link

     If you have a friend that works at a store which accepts credit cards,
ask him to write down the info before they are logged and stored in files. 
Of the three I have found mail boxing is the easiest and most
rewarding.  I have found blank checks, department store card #'s and once I
found an actual card which I put back in to ensure future jackpots.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

                    III.  Setting Up A Drop Site
     
     It is essential that you have a GOOD drop site.  This is the most crucial
point of the carding so choose wisely.  This is the only place you can be
physically caught. There are many good dropsites.
  
     Find a home where the people are out for the week or work all day.  Make
sure they will be out when they "receive" what "they" ordered.  Make sure
you find out the persons name so that the address matches up with the phone
number.

     The best place in my opinion is an apartment complex.  Go to the door
and say your a new tenant in 1D and Dad sent a package to 10D by accident. 
Ask if they could sign for it and you'll come pick it up later.  This also
works very well in old folks homes.

     Another drop site I am experimenting with now is as follows.  Go to a
street that has a vacant home or two on it.  Look around and find out if
some old dorks live on the block.  When you have found a block come back the
following Monday.  Go up to the old ass's door and tell them that you are
moving a week from Friday and you just wanted to get to know the neighbors. 
Be REALLY nice and tell them how you're moving from Germany where you're
dad was stationed.  Finally slip in the deal with the package and it would
be Swell if they would take the package for you.  This never fails, also give 
them a current address (Resident's inn or the whatever) and a bullshit phone 
number.  Tell them to call you when you it comes in.  You already know exactly
when it will come in and wait until it comes and get it 20 minutes later.
     
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
     
                    IV.  Ordering

     When ordering the merchandise, it is important to keep cool.  There are
two kinds of credit checks.  First they will verify the card credit line on
the CBI.  The CBI doesn't have the Exp. date because there are simply too
many cards in the U.S.  The second way they check is either call you at
home (if it's something like a 486 base system). But this costs a lot of
money and they will more likely call the area's information (xxx-555-1212)
and make sure that the name matches the address.

     I have found that if you want computer shit, you should buy a copy of
Byte or the like and look in the classified for small companies without an
800 order number.  These companies won't spend as much money as larger
companies.

     When you call up, ask all sorts of questions about the product like about
the warranty, reliability, compatibility, years before obsolescence, etc.  Like 
you were making a big investment.  Act like you would if you were actually 
spending your own hard earned money.  Ask about all the products' differences 
and finally say something like "I sold on that one..." or some bullshit line 
like that.  Make friends with him/her and talk to him with his first name.  When
you 'decide' what you want, order in one sentence. 

     She'll ask you what the billing address is, mailing address, daytime phone
number, who you want to ship it to, card type, name as it appears on the card,
account number, exp. date.  This is in no particular order.
     
                    Dialogue: Act mature!
     
     Salesperson: Hello, J&R MusicWorld, Jane speaking.
     You: Hello Jane, I would like some information on the Casio
     B.O.S.S. calculator, do you sell that?
     
     Salesperson: Yes we have several models in stock, which one are
     you interested in?
     You: I'm not sure, one of my co-workers has one and I was really
     impressed with it.  He referred me to this company for the lowest
     prices, payment plans, more bullshit...
     
     Salesperson: Models we have ETC.....
     You: Bullshit now in prices, value, etc.
     
     Salesperson: What model are you interested in?
     You: The 666 model... 
     
     Salesperson: How will you be paying for this purchase?
     You: Mastercard, is there any surcharge? 
     
     Salesperson: Not for MC (never for visa or MC), what's your last
     name?
     You: MY name is (card name) address is... cc# is 4000 0000,
     exp. date is 4/99, I want it sent to 666 Mark Twaine Rd. Parts
     unknown, Michigan, 48036, My daytime fone is 313-666-0000, etc
     
     Salesperson: How would you like to get this delivered?
     You: Ups overnight.
     
     Salesperson: Thank you for purchasing from J&R MusicWorld.
     You: Thank you Jane, I'll call you to tell you how I like it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
     
                    V.  Delivery
     
     There seems to be some misconceptions about Federal Express and UPS
delivery.  I will clear up the facts regarding these companies.

     Federal Express offers overnight and economy delivery service.  Both
services require signatures accepting the delivery.  The delivery men will
leave packages on the porch if there is a note with a signature on it to
accept it.

     United Parcel Service on the other hand requires a signature only for
overnight delivery, not for 2nd day delivery.  This is always my choice and
if possible, I will avoid Fed Ex only companies such as Hard Disks
International ( I tried to get a 100 megger from those bastards).  For
overnight just leave note saying that you have to work today.  Another
thing that you have to consider is:  if the delivery man thinks that it is
unsafe to leave the package, he won't because UPS would be responsible. 
Again, just leave a note.

     The overnight deliveries are guaranteed there by 10:00.  The Economy 
Service can be delivered any time in the business day (9-5).  On saturdays UPS 
now delivers for more money.  This will ensure that the regular delivery boy 
will not deliver and a sub will do the route in his place.  If you have an empty
house you can remove the for sale sign and get it delivered there.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

                    VI.  Pick-up
     
     Dress normally, the chances are greater that someone will notice you 
and remember your looks if you are wearing a sombrero and sun glasses.  It 
wouldn't be a bad idea to wear something that identifies you as a member of a
group like Boy Scouts or some shit like that.

     Go to the house early, about and hour in advance.  Watch the deliveryman
drop off the package.  Go to the door about 20 minutes later.  Carry a big
box with a smaller one in it.  Walk up to the house normally.  Pretend to
knock on the door, take the small box your carrying out of the big box and
exchange it with the carded items.  This will deter any nosy bitch neighbors.

     Try not to touch anything unnecessary like the doorknob.  Don't order it
to a place that is not highly visible... The most important thing though is
if you see ANYTHING that's vary suspicious or out of the ordinary, Do NOT
pick it up, wait and if the situation doesn't change leave immediately.

     When I started carding I knew a guy that carried mace or an electric stun 
gun with him (No really, I'm not BSin).  This seems a bit extreme, but if an
asshole wants to take you to the police station, what is better?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
     
                    VII.  Aftermath
     
     Lay Low for a while, if you were careful, the chances are that they will
not come to you.  Stash the merchandise at a friends home or in a locker
somewhere for at least a week.  Let the area cool off, the card owner will
not find out until the end of the month when he/she gets the bill.  At
first they will probably think it's a glitch and try to straighten things
out with the company while you are enjoying your new HST.

     It is always better when you sell what you card and buy the shit
legally.  And computer shit is 10 times harder to card so card shit like
two tennis racquets, or a Wizzard, or CD's or blank tapes.
  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
     
                    VIII.  Live with parents?
     
     If your parents know anything about your system then this poses a 
problem. You can over come this by telling them that a local underground BBS 
that John is on went down and he is selling his HST or whatever for 100 bux and
that you have the money saved up.  You are going to buy it and you want to let 
them know.  This usually works for me.  Or tell them that a friend is going to
Mexico for the summer to visit relatives and since he won't need it he is 
letting you have it for a while.  Or tell them that a SysOp of a PD board is the
owner of a computer store and he is having a toilet bowl (bullshit) sale which
means prices over 60% off!  He'll give you another 20% off!
    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
     
                    IX.  What to Card?
     
     The hardest thing to card is computer equipment, as a rule, just get
something else.  Your chances are doubled when you card say.. a tape deck. 
I recommend you card something that someone else needs. example... A friend
needs a new racquet but doesn't have much money, Card a couple  $200 dollar 
racquets that your "cousin" wants to sell.  That way the carded shit won't
collect dust, You make a quick $150 for two days.
     
          Things I recommend carding because of their resale value...
               1.  Blank Disk ( lots of 50, get 300)
               2.  Compact Disks ( Top 40 and Classic Rock sell VERY Well)
               3.  Porno Tapes ( Kids love them)
               4.  Sports Clothing ( Pistons Starter Jackets, etc.)
               5.  Stereo Equipment ( Tape Decks, Discmans, Walk mans)
               6.  Sports Equipment ( Tennis Racquets, Shoes)
               7.  Office Supplies ( Telephones, Fax Machines)
     
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
     
                    X.  Fucked Up?
     
     If you get caught (God forbid), just say that you found the card number
in a parking lot at so & so and hate those people.  You had no intention of
keeping the stuff and it was just a cruel, malicious "joke".  This scenario
shouldn't occur if your careful, but if it does, you didn't think that it
would work and they would just be hassled.
     
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
     
                    XI.  Miscellaneous Notes
     
     Computer equipment is the hardest thing to card.  I don't card computer
equipment and have only done it twice successfully because all the computer
geeks that get a hold of a text file will try and get a 200 megger and a HST.  
The majority of carders have nothing to do with computers.  I got started well 
before I got my modem and my first H/P/C/A access level on a BBS.

     Take that into consideration. Never keep card numbers on disk.  That way
If you get caught, they can't confiscate your computer.  Hide them in the
garage or basement.  I tape the info to the back of a poster.
