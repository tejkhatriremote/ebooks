1.  Where can I get a lock pick set?

  Try a locksmith supply house.  Look under "Locksmiths' Equipment &
Supplies" in the Yellow Pages.  Your State or the company may have
requirements, such as having to prove you are a locksmith or showing a
drivers license; call and find out.  Also look for mail order houses
in the Appendix.

2.  How can I make my own picks and tension wrenches?

  You can file or grind picks out of spring steel.  It is best to use
spring steel - sources include hacksaw blades, piano (music) wire,
clock springs, streetsweeper bristles (which can be found along the
street after the sweeper has passed), etc.  In a pinch safety pin
steel, or even a bobby pin (much worse) can be used.  When grinding,
keep the steel from getting so hot as to anneal (soften) it.  You may
have to re-harden/re-temper it.  (See a book on knife making,
gunsmithing, or machine shop practice for a discussion on heat
treating steel.)  Some people prefer a rigid tension wrench and just
bend a small screwdriver for this, but many prefer a slightly flexible
wrench and use spring steel.

The "MIT Guide to Picking Locks" and the "Eddie The Wire" books (see
below) cover making these tools.  There are many places you can buy
picks and tension wrenches.  See the appendix.

3.  Is it legal to carry lock picks?

  This depends on where you are.  In the U.S. the common case seems to
be that it is legal to carry potential "burglar tools" such as keys,
picks, crowbars, jacks, bricks, etc., but use of such tools to commit
a crime is a crime in itself.  Call your local library, district
attorney, or police department to be sure.

Places where it *is* illegal to carry lock picks:

The District of Columbia.

4.  Where can I get the "MIT Guide to Picking Locks"?

  You can't.  The guide must exist in an online form, but no one seems
to have it.  Rumor has it that (one of) the author(s) is aware of this
group and is unwilling to post the guide.

  The guide is copyrighted, so scanning it in and posting would, in
addition to violating the author's wishes, be illegal.

5. What books can I get on locksmithing?

An excellent encyclopedic reference (based on reading the 1st edition
- but people have said that the 2nd and 3rd editions carry on the
coverage)

The Complete Book of Locks & Locksmithing, 3rd Ed.
C.A. Roper and Bill Phillips   TAB Books
ISBN 0-8306-3522-X (Paper) 0-8306-?522-1 (Hard)
$18.95 (Paper) $26.95 (Hard)

also many people think highly of:

Eddie The Wire: How to Make Your Own Professional Lock Tools
"Eddie The Wire"      Loompanics Unlimited
ISBN 0-685-39143-4
4 Volumes $20

  Your local book store should be able to order these for you.  You
can find other titles under "Locksmithing" in the Books In Print
Subject Index, which any decent bookstore should have.  Also see the
Appendix.

6. What are "pick guns" or "automatic pickers" and do they work?

  A "pick gun" is a manual or powered device that uses a vibrating 
pin to try to bounce the pin tumblers so there are spaces at the shear 
line so the the plug can rotate.  They are not a panacea, aren't always
effective, and the net seems to feel that these are no substitute 
for a little skill with a pick and learning how locks work.

7. How do I open a Kryptonite lock?

    Easiest: If you registered your lock, call or write Kryptonite
    for a new key.  Or call a local locksmith, the should be able to
    pick and re-key the lock for you.

    Easy:  Get a car jack and jack it apart.

    Harder: If it doesn't have the newer brass jacket, peel back
    the plastic coating on the key end, drill out the pin that
    holds in the cylinder, remove the cylinder, open.

    Hardest: Chill the metal of the "U" with liquid Nitrogen or
    Freon, smash with hammer.

8.  How can I get keys stamped "DO NOT DUPLICATE" duplicated?

  Some locksmiths will take the Rebok approach and "Just Do It".
Some will even stamp "DO NOT DUPLICATE" on the copy for you.
If that doesn't work, label the key by sticking some tape on
the "DO NOT DUPLICATE" stamp and try again.

9.  Do Skeleton Keys Exists?

  "Skeleton Keys" are keys ground to avoid the wards in warded locks.
There is no analog with modern pin tumbler locks.  Master keys may
open a large set of locks, but this is designed in when the locks are
installed.
        
10. Should I bother with high security ("pick proof") locks for my home?

   Why not?  If you are installing locks, the better quality ones are
not much more expensive, and are physically more secure (e.g., have
hardened inserts to protect against drilling.)  However, note that
protection against picking doesn't add a large amount to your security
since burglars almost always go the brute force route.  Regardless,
you should have a deadbolt, and check your window security.

11. What should I do after I read a book?

  After some reading, then the next thing is some experience.  Go to
K-Mart, buy a deadbolt lock for around $10, and take the entire thing
apart (you'll need tools like screwdrivers, and perhaps a pair of
pliers) to see how a pin tumbler lock works.  K-Mart carries a clone
of the Kwikset which is made to be very easy to take apart.
(Key-in-knob locksets are both more expensive and harder to take
apart.)

  You then can practice picking this lock by leaving out all but one
stack of pins.  This will be exceedingly easy to pick, and will mostly
provide experience in manipulating the pick and tension wrench.  Then
put in one more pin stack and try again - feeling when one stack is
picked and then the second one will let the cylinder move.  Keep on
adding stacks.  Try picking with the curved finger, and also raking.

12. How do I continue learning about locksmithing?

  There are several things you can do to continue learning more about
locks and locksmithing.  One, of course, is to subscribe to a
locksmithing magazine.  Some years ago I compared the National
Locksmith to the Locksmith Ledger and felt that the latter was a bit
better on technical info.  Call yourself a Student Locksmith, or
perhaps a Security Consultant (surely you have given some advice to
*somebody*!).  But all this reading won't help all that much, so you
have to continue buying various types of locks, taking them apart,
figuring out everything about them, and installing, removing,
modifying them.  Buy some key blanks, make up a master key scheme, and
file the keys to fit (assuming you don't have a key machine) - filing
may take a few minutes, but it does work.  Maybe buy a re-keying kit
(kit of different size pins, with a follower) and do some re-keying
for your family or friends (the same size pins fit, I think, the
familiar Kwikset and Schlage pin tumbler locks) so that their
deadbolts can be opened with their normal front door key.  Or buy a
deadbolt installation kit (hole saw plus template - I think that Black
and Decker makes a good one, available at better building supply
places) and put in a few deadbolts for your family and friends -
charging them only for the material plus a couple of bucks towards the
installation kit - and re-key the deadbolt for them, too.  Buy or make
a pick set, and use your practice locks to practice picking.  Do you
have a good locksmith supply catalog?  If not, give a call to a local
supplier, or perhaps to Kenco of Lincoln?, Nebraska (they have an 800
number) and get their catalog - they sell lots of goodies including
most everything I've been discussing.  Help people at work who have
been locked out of their desks or filing cabinets.  Desks usually have
wafer tumbler locks which are *much* easier to pick than pin tumbler
locks.  Filing cabinets are not as easy to pick, but are pickable
(actually some are very easy to pick - they vary greatly) and also can
be opened by pushing a flexible plastic ruler past the sliding drawer
- carefully inspect some working cabinets to see what I'm talking
about.
