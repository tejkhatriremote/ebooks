Final Remarks  
 
 Lock picking is a craft, not a science. This document presents the knowledge and
 skills that are essential to lock picking, but more importantly it provides you with
 models and exercises that will help you study locks on your own. To excel at lock
 picking, you must practice and develop a style which fits you personally. Remember
 that the best technique is the one that works best for you.
