Chapter 3  
 
The Flatland Model  
 
 In order to become good at picking locks, you will need a detailed understanding
 of how locks works and what happens as it is picked. This document uses two
 models to help you understand the behavior of locks. This chapter presents a
 model that highlights interactions between pin positions. Chapter 4 uses this
 model to explain how picking works. Chapter 9 will use this model to explain
 complicated mechanical defects.
 
 The "flatland" model of a lock is shown in Figure 3.1 This is not a cross section
 of a real lock. It is a cross section of a very simple kind of lock. The purpose
 of this lock is to keep two plates of metal from sliding over each other unless
 the proper key is present. The lock is constructed by playing the two plates
 over each other and drilling holes which pass through both plates. The figure
 shows a two hole lock. Two pins are placed in each hole such that the gap between
 the pins does not line up with the gap between the plates. The bottom pin is
 called the _key pin_ because it touches the key. The top pin is called the
 _driver pin_. Often the driver and the key pins are just called the driver and
 the pin. A protrusion on the underside of the bottom plate keeps the pins from
 falling out, and a spring above the top plates pushed down on the driver pin.
 
 If the key is absent, the plates cannot slide over each other because the
 driver pins pass through both plates. See Figure 3.3. That is, the key lifts
 the key pin until its top reaches the lock's sheer line. In this configuration
 the plates can slide past each other.
 
 Figure 3.3 also illustrates one of the important features of real locks. There
 is always a sliding allowance. That is, any parts which will slide past each
 other must be separated by a gap. The gap between the top and bottom plates
 allows a range of keys to open the lock. Notice that the right key pin in
 Figure 3.3 is not raised as high as the left pin, yet the lock will still open.
