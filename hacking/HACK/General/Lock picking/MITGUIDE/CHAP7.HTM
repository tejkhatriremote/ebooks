Advanced Lock Picking  

 Simple lock picking is a trade that anyone can learn. However, advanced lock
 picking is a craft that requires mechanical sensitivity, physical dexterity,
 visual concentration and analytic thinking. If you strive to excel at lock
 picking, you will grow in many ways.
 
7.1 Mechanical Skills  
 
 Learning how to pull the pick over the pins is surprisingly difficult. The problem
 is that the mechanical skills you learned early in life involved maintaining a
 fixed position or fixed path for your hands independent of the amount of force
 required. IN lock picking, you must learn how to apply a fixed force independent
 of the position of you hand.  As you pull the pick out of the lock you want to
 apply a fixed pressure on the pins. The picks should bounce up and down in the
 keyway according to the resistance offered by each pin.
 
 To pick a lock you need feedback about the effects of your manipulations. To get
 the feedback, you must train yourself to be sensitive the sound and the feel of
 the pick passing over the pins. This is a mechanical skill that can only be learned
 with practice. The exercises will help you recognize the important information
 coming from your fingers.
 
7.2 Zen and the Art of Lock Picking  
 
 In order to excel at lock picking, you must train yourself to have a visually
 reconstructive imagination. The idea is to use information from all your senses
 to build a picture of what is happening inside the lock as you pick it. Basically,
 you want to project your senses into the lock to receive a full picture of how
 it is responding to your manipulations. Once you have learned how to build this
 picture, it is easy to choose manipulations that will open the lock.
 
 All your senses provide information about the lock. Touch and sound provide the
 most information, but the other senses can reveal critical information. For example,
 your nose can tell whether a lock has been lubricated recently. As a beginner,
 you will need to use your eyes for hand-eye coordination, but as you improve you
 will find it unnecessary to look at the lock. In fact, it is better to ignore
 your eyes to your sight to build an image of the lock based on the information you
 receive from your fingers and ears.
 
 The goal of this mental skill is to acquire a relaxed concentration on the lock.
 Don't force the concentration. Try to ignore the sensations and thoughts that are
 not related to the lock. Don't try to focus on the lock.
 
7.3 Analytic Thinking  
 
 Each lock has it's own special characteristics which make picking harder or easier.
 If you learn to recognize and exploit the "personality traits" of locks, picking
 will go much faster. Basically, you want to analyze the feedback you get from the
 lock to diagnose it's personality traits and then use your experience to decide on
 an approach to open a lock. Chapter 9 discusses a large number of common traits and
 ways to exploit or overcome them.
 
 People underestimate the analytic involved in lock picking. They think that the
 picking tool opens the lock. To them the torque wrench is a passive tool that just
 puts the lock under the desired stress. Let me propose another way to view the
 situation. The pick is just running over the pins to get information about the lock.
 Based on an analysis that information the torque is adjusted to make the pins set
 at the sheer line. It's the torque wrench that opens the lock.
 
 Varying the torque as the picks moves in and out of the keyway is a general trick
 that can be used to get around several picking problems. For example, if the middle
 pins are set, but the ends pins are not, you can increase the torque as the pick
 moves over the middle pins. This will reduce the chances of disturbing the correctly
 set pins. If some pin doesn't seem to lift up far enough as the pick passes over it,
 then try reducing the torque on the next pass.
 
 The skill of adjusting the torque while the pick is moving requires careful
 coordination between your hands, but as you become better at visualizing the
 process of picking the lock, you will become better at this important skill.
