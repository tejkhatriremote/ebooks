Chapter 9  
 
Recognizing and Exploiting Personality Traits
 
 Real locks have a wide range of mechanical features and defects that help and
 hinder lock picking. If a lock doesn't respond to scrubbing, then it probably has
 one of the traits discussed in this chapter. To open the lock, you must diagnose
 the trait and apply the recommended technique. The exercises will help you develop
 the mechanical sensitivity and dexterity necessary to recognize and exploit the
 different traits.
 
9.1  Which Way To Turn  
 
 It can be very frustrating to spend a long time picking a lock and then discover
 that you turned the plug the wrong way. If you turn a plug the wrong way it will
 rotate freely until it hits a stop, or until it rotates 180 degrees and the drivers
 enter the keyway (see section 9.11). Sections 9.11 also explains how to turn the
 plug more than 180 degrees if that is necessary to fully retract the bolt. When the
 plug is turned in the correct direction, you should feel an extra resistance when
 the plug cam engages the bolt spring.
 
 The direction to turn the plug depends on the bolt mechanism, not on the lock, but
 here are some general rules. Cheap padlocks will open if the plug is turned in
 either direction, so you can chose the direction which is best for the torque wrench.
 All padlocks made by the Master company can be opened in either direction. Padlocks
 made by Yale will only open if the plug is turned clockwise. The double plug Yale
 cylinder locks generally open by turning the bottom of the keyway (i.e., the flat
 edge of the key) away from the nearest door frame. Single plug cylinder locks also
 follow this rule. See Figure 9.1. Locks built into the doorknob usually open
 clockwise. Desk and filing cabinet locks also tend to open clockwise.
 
 When you encounter a new kind of lock mechanism, try turning the plug in both
 directions. In the correct direction, the plug will be stopped by the pins, so the
 stop will feel mushy when you use heavy torque. In the wrong direction the plug
 will be stopped by a metal tab, so the stop will feel solid.

9.2  How Far to Turn  
 
 The companion question to which way to turn a lock is how far to turn it. Desk
 and filing cabinet locks generally open with less than a quarter turn. Locks which
 are separate from the doorknob tend to require a half turn to open. Deadbolt lock
 mechanisms can require almost a full turn to open.

 Turning a lock more than 180 degrees is a difficult because the drivers enter the
 bottom of the keyway. See section 9.11.

9.3  Gravity  
 
 Picking a lock that has the springs at the top is different than picking one with
 the springs at the bottom. It should be obvious how to tell the two apart. The nice
 feature of a lock with the springs at the bottom is that gravity holds the key pins
 down once they set. With the set pins out of the way, it is easy to find and
 manipulate the remaining unset pins. It is also straight forward to test for the
 slight give of a correctly set pin. When the springs are on top, gravity will pull
 the key pins down after the driver pin catches at the sheer line. In this case, you
 can identify the set pins by noticing that the key pin is easy to lift and that it
 does not feel springy. Set pins also rattle as you draw the pick over them because
 they are not being pushed down by the driver pin.

9.4  Pins Not Setting  
 
 If you scrub a lock and pins are not setting even when you apply the torque, then
 some pin has a false set and it is keeping the rest of the pins from setting.
 Consider a lock whose pins prefer to set from back to front. If the back most pin
 false sets high or low (see Figure 9.2), then the plug cannot rotate enough to
 allow the other bins to bind. It is hard to recognize that a pin has false set
 because the springiness of the front pins makes it hard to sense the small give
 of a correctly set back pin. The main symptom of this situation is that the other
 pins will not set unless a very large torque is applied.

 When you encounter this situation, release the torque and start over by concentrating
 on the back pins. Try a light torque and moderate pressure, or heavy torque and
 heavy pressure. Try to feel for the click that happens when a pin reaches the sheer
 line and the plug rotates slightly. The click will be easier to feel if you use a
 stiff torque wrench.

9.5  Elastic Deformation  
 
 The interesting events of lock picking happen over distances measured in thousandths
 of an inch. Over such short distances, metals behave like springs. Very little force
 is necessary to deflect a piece metal over those distances, and when the force is
 removed, the metal will spring back to its original position.

 Deformation can be used to your advantage if you want to force several pins to
 bind at once. For example, picking a lock with pins that prefer to be set from
 front to back is slow because the pins set one at a time. This is particularly true
 if you only apply pressure as the pick is drawn out of the lock. Each pass of the
 pick will only set the front most pin that is binding. Numerous passes are required
 to set all the pins. IF the preference for setting is not very strong(i.e. the axis
 of the plug holes is only slightly skewed from the plug's center line), then you
 can cause additional pins to bind by applying extra torque. Basically, the torque
 puts a twist in the pug that causes the front of the plug to be deflected further
 than the back of the plug. With light torque, the back of the plug stays in its
 initial position, but with medium to heavy torque, the front pin columns bend enough
 to allow the back of the plug to rotate and thus cause the back pins to bind. With
 the extra torque, a single stroke of the pick can set several pins, and the lock
 can be opened quickly. Too much torque causes its own problems.
 
 When the torque is large, the front pins and plug holes can be deformed enough to
 prevent the pins from setting correctly. In particular, the first pin tends to false
 set low. Figure 9.2 shows how excess torque can deform the bottom of the driver pin
 and prevent the key pin from reaching the sheer line. This situation can be recognized
 by the lack of give in the first pin. Correctly set pins feel springy if they are
 pressed down slightly. A falsely set pin lacks this springiness. The solution is to
 press down hard on the first pin. You may want to reduce the torque slightly, but if
 you reduce torque too much then the other pins will unset as the first pin is being
 depressed.
 
 It is also possible to deform the top of the key pin. The key pin is scissored
 between the plug and the hull and stays fixed. When this happens, the pin is said
 to be false set high.

9.6  Loose Plug  
 
 The plug is held into the hull by being wider at the front and by having a cam
 on the back that is bigger than the hole drilled into the hull. If the cam is not
 properly installed, the plug can move in and out of the lock slightly on the outward
 stroke of the pick, the plug will move forward, and in and out of the lock slightly.
 On the outward stroke of the pick, the plug will move forward, and if you apply
 pressure on the inward stroke, the plug will be pushed back.
 
 The problem with a loose plug is that the driver pins tend to set on the back of
 the plug holes rather than on the sides of the holes. When you push the plug in,
 the drivers will unset. You can use this defect to your advantage by only applying
 pressure on the outward or inward stroke of the pick. Alternatively, you can use
 your finger or torque wrench to prevent the plug from moving forward.

<img src="fig96.gif"><br>

9.7  Pin Diameter  
 
 When the pair of pins in a particular column have different diameters, that column
 will react strangely to the pressure of the pick.
 
 The top half of Figure 9.3 shows a pin column with a driver pin that has a larger
 diameter than the key pin. As the pins are lifted, the picking pressure is resisted
 by the binding friction and the spring force. Once the driver clears the sheer
 line, the plug rotates (until some other pin binds) and the only resistance to
 motion is the spring force. If the key pin is small enough and the plug did not
 rotate very far, the key pin can enter the hull without colliding with the edge of
 the hull. Some other pin is binding, so again the only resistance to motion is the
 spring force. This relationship is graphed in the bottom half of the Figure. Basically,
 the pins feel normal at first, but then the lock clicks and the pin becomes springy.
 The narrow key pin can be pushed all the way into the hull without loosing its
 springiness, but when the picking pressure is released, the key pin will fall back
 to its initial position while the large driver catches on the edge of the plug hole.

 The problem with a large driver pin is that the key pin tends to get in the hull
 when some other pin sets. Imagine that a neighboring pin sets and the plug rotates
 enough to bind the narrow key pin. If the pick was pressing down on the narrow key
 pin at the same time as it was pressing down on the pin that set, then the narrow
 key pin will be in the hull and it will get stuck there when the plug rotates.
 
 The behavior of a large key pin is left as an exercise for the reader.

9.8  Beveled Holes and Rounded pins  
 
 Some lock manufacturers (e.g., Yale) bevel the edges of the plug holes and/or
 round off the ends of the key pins. This tends to reduce the wear on the lock and
 it can both help and hinder lock picking. You can recognize a lock with these
 features by the large give in set pins. See figure 9.4. that is, the distance between
 the height at which the driver pin catches on the edge of the plug hole and the
 height at which the driver pin catches on the edge of the plug hole and the height
 at which the key pin hits the hull is larger (sometimes as large as a sixteenth of
 an inch)  when the plug holes are beveled or the pins are rounded. While the key pin
 is moving between those two heights, the only resistance to motion will be the force
 of the spring. There won't be any binding friction. This corresponds to the dip in
 the force graph shown in Figure 5.5
 
 A lock with beveled plug holes requires more scrubbing to open than a lock without
 beveled holes because the driver pins set on the bevel instead of setting on the
 top of the plug. The plug will not turn if one of the drivers is caught on a bevel.
 The key pin must be scrubbed again to push the driver pin up and off the bevel.
 The left driver pin in Figure 9.6a is set. The driver is resting on the bevel,
 and the bottom plate has moved enough to allow the right driver to bind. Figure 9.6
 shows what happens after the right driver pin sets. The bottom plate slides further
 to the right and now the left driver pin is scissored between the bevel and the
 top plate. It is caught on the bevel. To open the lock, the left driver pin must
 be pushed up above the bevel. Once that driver is free, the bottom plate can slide
 and the right driver may bind on its bevel.
 
 If you encounter a lock with beveled plug holes, and all the pins appear to be set
 but the lock is not opening, you should reduce torque and continue scrubbing over
 the pins. The reduced torque will make it easier to push the drivers off the bevels.
 If pins unset when you reduce the torque, try increasing the torque and picking
 pressure. The problem with increasing the force is that you may jam some key pins
 into the hull.

9.9   Mushroom Driver Pins  
 
 A general trick that lock makers use to make picking harder is to modify the shape
 of the driver pin. the most popular shapes are mushroom, spool and serrated, see
 Figure 9.7. The purpose of these shapes is to cause the pins to false set low.
 These drivers stop a picking technique called vibration picking (see section 9.12),
 but they only slightly complicate scrubbing and one-pin-at-a-time picking (see
 chapter 4).
 
 If you pick a lock and the plug stops turning after a few degrees and none of the
 pins can be pushed up any further, then you known that the lock has modified
 drivers. Basically, the lip of the driver has caught at the sheer line. See the
 bottom of Figure 9.7. Mushroom and spool drivers are often found in Russwin locks,
 and locks that have several spacers for master keying.
 
 You can identify the positions with the mushroom drivers by applying a light
 torque and pushing up on each pin. The pins with mushroom drivers will exhibit a
 tendency to bring the plug back to the fully locked position. By pushing the key
 pin up you are pushing the flat top of the key pin against the tilted bottom of
 the mushroom driver. this causes the drive to straighten up which in turn causes
 the plug to unrotate. You can use this motion to identify the columns that have
 mushroom drivers. Push those pins up to sheer line; even if you lose some of the
 other pins in the process they will be easier to re-pick than the pins with
 mushroom drivers. Eventually all the pins will be correctly set at the sheer line.
 
 One way to identify all the positions with mushroom drivers is to use the flat of
 your pick to push all the pins up about halfway. This should put most of the drivers
 in their cockable position and you can feel for them.
 
 To pick a lock with modified drivers, use a lighter torque and heavier pressure.
 You want to error on the side of pushing the key pins too far into the hull. In
 fact, another way to pick these locks is to use the flat side of your pick to push
 the pins up all the way, and apply very heavy torque to hold them there. Use a
 scrubbing action to vibrate the key pins while you slowly reduce the torque. Reducing
 the torque reduces the binding friction on the pins. The vibration and spring
 force cause the key pins to slide down to the sheer line.
 
 The key to picking locks with modified drivers is recognizing incorrectly set pins.
 A mushroom driver set on its lip will not have the springy give of a correctly
 set driver. Practice recognizing the difference.

9.10 Master Keys  
 
 Many applications require keys that open only a single lock and keys that opens group
 of locks. The keys that open a single lock are called _change keys_ and the keys
 that open multiple locks are called _master keys_. To allow both the change key and
 the master key to open the same lock, a locksmith adds an extra pin called a
 _spacer_ to some of the pin columns. See Figure 9.8. The effect of the spacer is
 to create two gaps in the pin column that could be lined up with the sheer line.
 Usually the change key aligns the top of the spacer with the sheer line, and the
 master key aligns the bottom of the spacer with the sheer line (the idea is to
 prevent people from filing down a change key to get a master key.) In either case
 the plug is free to rotate.
 
 In general, spacers make a lock easier to pick. They increase the number of
 opportunities to set each pin, and they make it more likely that the lock can by
 opened by setting all the pins at about the same height. In most cases only two
 or three positions will have spacers. You can recognize a position with a spacer
 by the two clicks you feel when the pin is pushed down. If the spacer has a smaller
 diameter than the driver and key pins, then you will feel a wise springy region
 because the spacer will not bind as it passes through the sheer line. It is more
 common for the spacer to be larger than the driver pin. You can recognize this by
 an increase in friction when the spacer passes through the sheer line. Since the
 spacer is larger than the driver pin, it will also catch better on the plug. If
 you push the spacer further into the hull, you will feel a strong click when the
 bottom of the spacer clears the sheer line.
 
 Thin spacers can cause serious problems. If you apply heavy torque and the plug
 has beveled holes, the spacer can twist and jam at the sheer line. It is also
 possible for the spacer to fall into the keyway if the plug is rotated 180 degrees.
 See section 9.11 for the solution to this problem.

<img src="fig910.gif"><br>

9.11  Driver or Spacer Enters Keyway  
 
 Figure 9.9 shows how a spacer or driver pin can enter the keyway when the plug is
 rotated 180 degrees. You can prevent this by placing the flat side of your pick in
 the bottom of the keyway BEFORE you turn the plug too far. If a spacer or driver
 does enter the keyway and prevent you from turning the plug, use the flat side of
 your pick to push the spacer back into the hull. You may need to use the torque
 wrench to relieve any sheer force that is binding the spacer or driver. If that
 doesn't work try raking over the drivers with the pointed side of your pick. If a
 spacer falls into the keyway completely, the only option is to remove it. A hook
 shaped piece of spring steel works well for this, though a bent paper clip will
 work just as well unless the spacer becomes wedged.
 
9.12  Vibration Picking  
 
 Vibration picking works by creating a large gap between the key and driver pins.
 The underlying principle is familiar to anyone who has played pool. When the queue
 ball strikes another ball squarely, the queue ball stops and the other ball heads
 off with the same speed and direction as the queue ball. Now imagine a device that
 kicks the tips of all the key pins. The key pins would transfer their momentum to
 the driver pins which would fly up into the hull. If you are applying a light
 torque when this happens, the plug will rotate when all the drivers are above the
 sheer line.
 
9.13 Disk Tumblers  
 
 The inexpensive locks found on desks use metal disks instead of pins. Figure 9.10
 shows the basic workings of these locks. the disks have the same outline but differ
 in the placement of the rectangular cut.
 
 These locks are easy to pick with the right tools. Because the disks are placed close
 together a half-round pick works better than a half-diamond pick (see Figure A.1).
 You may also need a torque wrench with a narrower head. Use moderate to heavy torque.
