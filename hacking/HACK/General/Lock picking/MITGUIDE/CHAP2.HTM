Chapter 2   
 
How a Key Opens a Lock   
 
 This chapter presents the basic workings of pin tumbler locks, and the
 vocabulary used in the rest of this booklet. The terms used to describe locks
 and lock parts vary from manufacture to manufacture and from city to city, so
 even if you already understand the basic workings of locks, you should look at
 figure 2.1 for the vocabulary.
 
 Knowing how a lock works when it is opened by a key is only part of what you need
 to know. You also need to know how a lock responds to picking. Chapters 3 and 5
 present models which will help you understand a lock's response to picking.
 
 Figure 2.1 introduces the vocabulary of real locks. The key is inserted into
 the _keyway_ of the _plug_. The protrusions on the side of the keyway are
 called _wards_. Wards restrict the set of keys that can be inserted into the
 plug. The plug is a cylinder which can rotate when the proper key is fully
 inserted. The non-rotating part of the lock is called the _hull_. The first
 pin touched by the key is called pin one. The remaining pins are numbered
 increasingly toward the read of the lock.
 
 The proper key lifts each pin pair until the gap between the _key pin_ and the
 _driver pin_ reaches the _sheer line_. When all the pins are in this position,
 the plug can rotate and the lock can be opened. An incorrect key will leave some
 of the pins protruding between the hull and the plug, and these pins will prevent
 the plug from rotating.
