Chapter 1  
 
It's Easy  
 
 
 The big secret of lock picking is that it's easy. Anyone can learn how to pick locks.
 
 The theory of lock picking is the theory of exploiting mechanical defects.
 There are a few basic concept and definitions but the bulk of the material
 consist of tricks for opening locks with particular defects or characteristics.
 The organization of this manual reflects this structure. The first few chapters
 present the vocabulary and basic information about locks and lock picking.
 There is no way to learn lock picking without practicing, so one chapter
 presents a set of carefully chosen exercises that will help you learn the
 skills of lock picking. The document ends with a catalog of the mechanical
 traits and defects found in locks and the techniques used to recognize and
 exploit them. The first appendix describes how to make lock picking tools.
 The other appendix presents some of the legal issues of lock picking.
 
 The exercises are important. The only way to learn how to recognize and
 exploit the defects in a lock is to practice. This means practicing many times
 on the same lock as well as practicing on many different locks. Anyone can
 learn how to open desk and filing cabinet locks, but the ability to open most
 locks in under thirty seconds is a skill that requires practice.
 
 Before getting into the details of locks and picking, it is worth pointing out
 that lock picking is just one way to bypass a lock, though it does cause less
 damage than brute force techniques. In fact, it may be easier to bypass the bolt
 mechanism than to bypass the lock. It may also be easier to bypass some other
 part of the door or even avoid the door entirely.
 Remember: There is always another way, usually a better one.
