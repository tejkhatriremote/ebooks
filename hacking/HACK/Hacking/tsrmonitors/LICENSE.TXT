Agreement, "Licensor" shall be defined as follows: If you
have acquired a third party product or service and such

the security mechanisms implemented by the Software have
inherent limitations, and you must determine that the
Software sufficiently meets your requirements. Licensor

from the date you acquired the Software.  Licensor's sole
liability for any breach of this warranty shall be, in
Licensor's sole discretion: (i) to replace your defective
media or Software; or (ii) to advise you how to achieve
substantially the same functionality with the Software as
described in the Documentation through a procedure
different from that set forth in the Documentation; or
(iii) if the above remedies are impracticable, to refund
the license fee you paid for the Software. Repaired,
corrected, or replaced Software and Documentation shall

date (a) of delivery to you of the repaired or replaced
Software, or (b) Licensor advised you how to operate the
Software so as to achieve substantially the same
functionality described in the Documentation.

Software during the applicable warranty period and
provide evidence of the date you purchased a license to
the Software will Licensor be obligated to honor this
warranty. Licensor will use reasonable commercial efforts
to repair, replace, advise or, for individual consumers,
refund pursuant to the foregoing warranty within thirty
(30) days of being so notified.

accident, abuse, or improper use; or if you violate the
terms of this Agreement, then this warranty shall
immediately terminate.  Moreover, this warranty shall not
apply if the Software is used on or in conjunction with
hardware or software other than the unmodified version of
hardware and software with which the Software was
designed to be used as described in the Documentation.

INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION,
OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES. IN NO
EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES IN EXCESS

FROM LICENSOR'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW

MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

and is not designed, manufactured or intended for use or
resale as on-line control equipment in hazardous
environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in

life support machines, or weapons systems, in which the
failure of the Software could lead directly to death,
personal injury, or severe physical or environmental
damage ("High Risk Activities").  Accordingly, Licensor
