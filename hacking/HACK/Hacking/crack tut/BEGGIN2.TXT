In part two of this beginners cracking tutorial, I examine one of Lord Caligo's own creations; try_me.com. This file was
altogether not too difficult, and can be found on Lord Caligo's website. 

                                       And now, the cracking! 


Ok, the first thing I did was to dissassemble the program with Sourcer. The listing looks like this: 

                in      al,21h                  ; port 21h, 8259-1 int
IMR
                xor     cx,cx                   ; Zero register
                mov     bx,12Ah
                mov     dx,16Ch
                call    sub_1
                call    sub_3
                call    sub_4                   ; Sub does not return
here
loc_1:
                inc     ch
loc_2:
                int     21h                     ; DOS Services
ah=function 00h
                                                ;  terminate, cs=progm
seg prefx
                jmpn    loc_3
                db       31h, 32h, 33h
sub_1           proc    near
                or      al,2
                retn
sub_1           endp
sub_2           proc    near
                and     al,0FDh
                retn
sub_2           endp
sub_3           proc    near
                cmp     al,0AAh
                jne     loc_4                   ; Jump if not equal
                retn
loc_3:
                inc     cl
                inc     bx
                cmp   ch,3
                je      loc_5                   ; Jump if equal
                cmp     al,[bx]
                je      loc_1                   ; Jump if equal
                call    sub_5
                jmpn    loc_7
loc_4:
                mov     dx,164h
                jmpn    loc_6
loc_5:
                mov     dx,offset data_2        ; ('')
loc_6:
                mov     ah,9
                int     21h                     ; DOS Services
ah=function 09h
                                                ;  display char string at
ds:dx
loc_7:
                int     20h                     ; DOS program terminate
sub_3           endp
sub_4:
                out     21h,al                  ; port 21h, 8259-1 int
comands

sub_5           proc    near
                cmp     al,0Dh
                jne     loc_2                   ; Jump if not equal
                jmp     short loc_4
sub_5           endp

                db      0C3h
                db      0Ah, 0Dh, 'false$'
                db      ' - TRY*ME v1.00 '
copyright       db      '(c) by Lord Caligo - 

In the above code, basically we see that in loc_3, ch is compared with 3, and
if they are equal, data_2 ("right") is put into dx and then is printed, after,
the program is terminated with int 20. So, all we really have to do is change
loc_3 to read jmp loc_5 (actually, we'd have to chane loc_5 to some sort of
memory location). So.... the crack for try_me.com:

  search for:  the mnemonics for je loc_5 (7516)
replace with:  the mnemonics for jmp loc_5 (EB1C)



                                            WTF???



It seems that when we modified the program, no longer is the prompt for the
password shown; the password is automatically right, you don't have to enter
anything! Tres bizzare! (I'm not french; this is appropriate though. I am
the only American cracker I know)


                                   Why I chose to accept this crack



The reason I didn't go back and alter this crack to ask for a password is
that if you've ever downloaded a cracked password crippled game, you notice
that most of the time you don't have to enter a password anyway, the cracker
did a good job. So I thought "What the hell, no one wants to enter a password anyway".
