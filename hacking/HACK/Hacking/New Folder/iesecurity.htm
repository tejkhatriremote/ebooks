      Internet Explorer are Affected by Security Issues?</font></i></strong><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
      <b>
      All</b> versions of Internet Explorer are vulnerable
      to one or more security issues. Most of these issues are the result of
      design flaws (such as the Cybersnot, MIT, UMD problems), while some are
      bugs and others the result of third parties (such as the Java security
      problem reported by <a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,8542,00.html">C|Net</a>).
      In addition, all International versions of IE are affected. As previously
      mentioned, IE for the Macintosh is affected by the Java security issue
      discovered by <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems</a>. The Sun
      Java issues was researched by Microsoft, and they determined that Windows
      versions of IE are not affected. A patch for the Mac version is available
      at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/security/java.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/ie/security/java.htm</a>
      and it should be downloaded and installed by all IE Macintosh users.
      Again, there is a second Java security issue that affects IE3.01 users.
      For more information on the second issue (including the downloadable fix),
      see Microsoft's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/java/issue.htm">Known
      Issues in Internet Explorer Java Support</a> page.<br>
      <br>
      A partial table listing the affected versions can be found <a href="http://www.tbtf.com/resource/ms-sec-exploits.html">here</a>.<br>
      <br>
      Administrators, ISPs and others who are distributing IE via the Internet
      Explorer Administration Kit (IEAK) are also affected. To get an in-place
      update of the IEAK, visit Microsoft's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/ieak/">IEAK

      and KB article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q214/6/52.asp">Q214652</a>,
      which discuss the &quot;Word 97 Template Vulnerability.&quot;&nbsp; This
      issue was reported by Woody's Office Watch, and DavidF, one of their
      readers.&nbsp; The vulnerability allows malicious macro code to be run in
      a Word 97 document without warning a user when the document is opened.&nbsp;
      A security feature within Word 97 warns users when a document containing
      macros is opened.&nbsp; But, if the&nbsp; document doesn't contain macros,
      but rather is linked to a template that contains macros, no warning to the
      user appears.&nbsp; It is possible for someone to exploit this
      vulnerability by causing malicious macro code to run without any warning
      if a Word document attached to an email, or on a web site, is opened.&nbsp;
      This malicious macro could then possibly be used to damage or retrieve
      data on a user's system.&nbsp; Microsoft has released a <a href="http://officeupdate.microsoft.com/downloaddetails/wd97sp.htm">patch</a>
      for this issue.&nbsp; If you run Word 97, I strongly recommend that you
      install the patch.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On <b>January 28, 1999</b>, a Javascript
      vulnerability in IE 4.x was reported by <a href="mailto:guninski@hotmail.com">Georgi
      Guninski</a>.&nbsp; Mr. Guninski is credited with the discovery and
      reporting of other IE security issues, including the <strong>Cross Frame
      Navigate Vulnerability </strong>issue that was reported in September 1998.&nbsp;
      This security hole allows a malicious webmaster to read files on users'
      hard drives, if the webmaster knows the path and filename.&nbsp; Mr.
      Guninski demonstrates this vulnerability on his <a href="http://www.whitehats.com/guninski/good-read.html">web
      site</a>.&nbsp; In addition, IE is vulnerable to &quot;window
      spoofing.&quot;&nbsp; This means that a malicious webmaster can create a
      link or a page that causes the user to believe they're surfing a trusted
      site, when in fact the content originates from the hostile site.&nbsp;
      This means that any information the user enters (e.g., name, address,
      credit card, etc.) will go to the hostile site, and not to the trusted
      site that the user thinks they're surfing.&nbsp; Apparently, this
      vulnerability can be also exploited using an HTML email message.&nbsp; Mr.
      Guninski demonstrates this second vulnerability at on his <a href="http://www.whitehats.com/guninski/read4.html">web
      site</a>.&nbsp; He also has a third <a href="http://www.whitehats.com/guninski/read5.html">demonstration</a>
      that reads the local autoexec.bat file.&nbsp; Microsoft has not confirmed
      this issue as yet.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On <b>February 10, 1999</b>, <a href="mailto:cuartangojc@mx3.redestb.es">Juan
      Carlos G. Cuartango</a> reported his discovery of what he is calling the <em>&quot;new
      Clipboard vulnerability&quot;<i> </i></em>in Internet Explorer 4.0.&nbsp;
      According to Mr. Cuartango, there is a vulnerability in the Microsoft Web
      Browser ActiveX control that allows a malicious webmaster to bypass the
      normal safeguards that prevent Internet Explorer scripts from pasting the
      contents of the clipboard into an input box unless IE owns the clipboard
      content.&nbsp; This can be exploited in both a web page and an HTML mail
      message.&nbsp; This vulnerability is demonstrated at Mr. Cuartango's <a href="http://pages.whowhere.com/computers/cuartangojc/cb.html">web
      site</a>.&nbsp; Microsoft is aware of this issue and a fix for the
      vulnerability will be in the next Service Pack for IE.&nbsp; Neither IE3
      nor IE5 are affected by this issue.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> On <b>March
      10, 1999</b>, <a href="http://www.pharlap.com/">Phar Lap Software</a>
      President Richard Smith reported his discovery of a security problem with
      an ActiveX control that's installed on every Windows 98 machine.&nbsp; During the Windows98 installation process, a
      unique hardware ID and a unique &quot;Microsoft ID&quot; are generated and
      stored in the registry.&nbsp; Windows 98
      also ships with an information gathering tool and software registration
      application called the Registry Wizard (&quot;RegWiz&quot; for short).&nbsp;
      A core component of this Wizard is the RegWiz ActiveX control.&nbsp; Mr.
      Smith discovered that by implementing this ActiveX control in a web page,
      a malicious webmaster can cause Windows 98 to send some registration
      information to the web site, which includes these unique IDs.&nbsp; A
      demonstration of this security issue can be found at the Phar Lap <a href="http://security.pharlap.com/regwiz/index.htm">web
      site</a>.&nbsp; Because I've found that site slightly difficult to connect
      to, I've modified Mr. Smith's demo page and mirrored it <a href="pharlap.htm">here</a>.&nbsp;
Because this hole makes it possible for a malicious webmaster to receive private
information from within the Windows 98 registry, I would consider it a major
hole.&nbsp; Microsoft is aware of the issue and is working on a fix.&nbsp; As
soon as the fix is released it will be reported here, so keep checking the FAQ.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">  On <b>March
25, 1999</b>,&nbsp; <a href="mailto:cuartangojc@mx3.redestb.es">Juan
      Carlos G. Cuartango</a> reported his discovery of what I believe to be the
first reported IE5 security issue.&nbsp; IE5 comes with two similar ActiveX
controls.&nbsp; One is called the <i>&quot;DHTML Edit Control for IE
5.&quot;&nbsp; </i>The other is called the <i>&quot;DHTML Edit Control Safe for
Scripting for IE5.&quot;&nbsp; </i>According to Mr. Cuartango, who has himself
discovered and reported several other IE security issues, there are two security
holes within &quot;Safe for Scripting&quot; ActiveX control.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">First, there's the vulnerability that Mr. Cuartango
has dubbed the <i>&quot;DHTML Editor Clipboard vulnerability.&quot;</i>&nbsp;
This issue presents another instance where a malicious webmaster can cause the
contents of the Windows clipboard to be transmitted to their web site.&nbsp;
You'll recall that Microsoft has implemented safeguards that prevent IE scripts from pasting the
      contents of the clipboard into an input box unless IE owns the clipboard
      content.&nbsp; Using the following simple code, this protection can be
bypassed:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana">function getcb()<br>
    {<br>
    dh.DOM.body.innerHTML=&quot;&quot;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    // clear body<br>
    dh.execCommand(5032);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    // paste<br>
    S1.value = dh.DOM.body.innerText;&nbsp;&nbsp; // copy to text area<br>
    }</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You can find a demonstration of this vulnerability
on Mr. Cuartango's <a href="http://pages.whowhere.com/computers/cuartangojc/dhtmle2.html">web
site</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Second, there's the vulnerability that Mr.
Cuartango has dubbed &quot;<i>The DHTML Editor cross-frame hole.&quot;</i>&nbsp;
This hole is serious for two reasons: (1) it bypasses the rule that scripts can
only access documents in the same domain using the same protocol; and (2) it
allows transaction spoofing.&nbsp; While the &quot;Safe for Scripting&quot;
control cannot navigate, it can submit forms.&nbsp; This means that a malicious

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To make matters interesting, according to Mr.
Cuartango, even if Microsoft fixes this hole, it could exist forever.&nbsp; In
his report to NTBugTraq, Mr. Cuartango said:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;As far as I know this is
      the first time a hole is &quot;SIGNED&quot;. MS has released an &quot;dhtmed.cab&quot;
      file as an ActiveX component signed by Microsoft ,anibody can distribute
      this file and the victim will only see a message telling him that the
      component is &quot;Microsoft signed&quot;, I trust MS, everybody trust MS,
      we will accept the ActiveX. MS has invented a very clever method to sign
      software, but there is not a way to revoke the signature.</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">There is something rare in the
      CLSID.&nbsp; Whenever an HTML page references a not registered CLSID
      nothing happens, just the object is not created. The &quot;DHTML Edit
      Control&quot; CLSID (clsid:2D360201-FFF5-11d1-8D03-00A0C959BC0A) is very
      special, Internet Explorer (4 and 5) will try to download the component
      from MS even if CODEBASE is not defined for the object. Is this a
      documented feature ? You can test this behaviour, : unregister the
      component &quot;dhtmle.ocx&quot; (using regsvr32.exe) and then load the
      page <a href="http://pages.whowhere.com/computers/cuartangojc/dhtmle2.html">http://pages.whowhere.com/computers/cuartangojc/dhtmle2.html</a>
      Why the browser decides to go to MS site ? It only knows :
      clsid:2D360201-FFF5-11d1-8D03-00A0C959BC0A.&nbsp; Acoording whit MS
      documentation a CODEBASE parameter must be explicited in the OBJECT
      &quot;object&quot; to download the component.&quot;</font></i></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I wanted to take a moment
      to thank Juan Carlos for bringing these issues to Microsoft's attention
      prior to posting the issues publicly. I also wanted to post Microsoft's
      response to the issues he's discovered.</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">1) Internet Explorer has
      customizable security settings in place for users who are concerned about
      allowing certain functionality. In this particular case, concerned users
      can easily block this behavior by checking either 'disable' or 'prompt'
      under &quot;Allow paste operations via script&quot; in the custom settings
      section in security zones. Using the IEAK, admins can also adjust the
      default setting for this option before distributing Internet Explorer to
      their users. The option is set to 'enable' by default to allow enhanced
      functionality.</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">2) Upon investigation we did find
      a cross domain security violation in the DHTML edit control which we will
      revoke, fix, and release.</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">3) Internet Explorer has a
      mechanism in place which allows Microsoft to release a .reg file to block
      ActiveX controls by changing a bit in the registry.</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">4) The following information
      found on MSDN (search on CodeBaseSearchPath) addresses this concern: When
      Internet Component Download is called to download code, it traverses the
      Internet search path to look for the desired component. This path is a
      list of object store servers that will be queried every time components
      are downloaded using CoGetClassObjectFromURL. This way, even if an
      &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag in an HTML document does not specify a CODEBASE
      location to download code for an embedded OLE control, the Internet
      Component Download will still use the Internet search path to find the
      necessary code. Internet search path syntax The search path is specified
      in a string in the registry, under the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet
      Settings\CodeBaseSearchPath. The value for this key is a string in the
      following format: CodeBaseSearchPath = &lt;URL1&gt;; &lt;URL2&gt;; ...
      &lt;URLm&gt;; CODEBASE; &lt;URLm+1&gt;; ... &lt;URLn-1&gt;; &lt;URLn&gt;
      In this format, each of URL1 through URLn is an absolute URL pointing to
      HTTP servers acting as &quot;object stores&quot;. When processing a call
      to CoGetClassObjectFromURL, the Internet Component Download service will
      first try downloading the desired code from the locations URL1 through
      URLm, then try the location specified in the szCodeURL parameter
      (corresponding to the CODEBASE attribute in the &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag), and
      will finally try the locations specified in locations URLm+1 through URLn.
      Note that if the CODEBASE keyword is not included in the key, calls to
      CoGetClassObjectFromURL will never check the szCodeURL location for
      downloading code. By removing the CODEBASE keyword from the key, corporate
      intranet administrators can effectively disable Internet Component
      Download for corporate users.&quot;</font></i></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Needless to say, these are some very interesting
issues.&nbsp; Even as time passes, and browsers become more and more advanced,
there still remains many opportunities for malicious webmasters to exploit
security vulnerabilities in web browsers.&nbsp; On <b>April 21, 1999</b>,
Microsoft released a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q226/3/26.asp">patch</a>
for this issue.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">   On <b>March
26, 1999</b>, <a href="http://www.bugnet.com/">BugNet</a> issued an <a href="http://www.bugnet.com/alerts/bugalert.html">alert</a>
regarding IE5's interaction with Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP).&nbsp;
PPTP is a networking technology that supports multi-protocol virtual private
networks (VPNs).&nbsp; It allows remote users to dial into a local Internet
service provider, connect securely to their corporate network through the
Internet, and access the corporate network securely from NT Workstation, Win9x,
and other point-to-point protocol (PPP)-enabled systems.&nbsp; But according to
KeyLabs, simply enabling PPTP on an NT 4 server or workstation has the effect of
disabling web browsing with IE5.&nbsp; According to BugNet's alert, Microsoft
has not responded to repeated requests for comment on this.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On <b>March 26, 1999</b>, Microsoft release
Knowledge Base article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q223/7/80.asp">Q223780</a>
which discusses cookie support in IE5.&nbsp; Earlier versions of IE used global
cookie settings, which means they're either on or off.&nbsp; IE5 introduces
cookies on a per-zone basis.&nbsp; This enhances cookie use because it means you
can turn them off on the Internet and keep them on in your Intranet or other
trusted sites.&nbsp; The issue here is that if you have cookies turned off and
you upgrade to IE5, cookies are re-enabled during the IE5 setup process.&nbsp;

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">    On <b>March
31, 1999</b>, Georgi Guninski reported his discovery of a serious security hole
in IE5 that allows the sending of local files to a malicious web server.&nbsp;
According to Mr. Guninski, who is credited with the discovery of other IE
security problems, there is a bug in the DHTML Edit control that allows the
pasting of a file name into a file object.&nbsp; As a result, a simple
JavaScript form can be used to send the contents of a file to a remote web
server.&nbsp; The only caveat is that the path and file name must be known to
the malicious webmaster in order for them to be able to receive it.&nbsp; This
isn't too difficult given the default paths and filenames typically found on a
Windows PC.&nbsp; Mr. Guninski has posted an example of this exploit on his <a href="http://www.nat.bg/~joro/fr.html">web
site</a>.&nbsp; Mr. Guninski also thanked Juan Carlos G. Cuartango for his IE
security discoveries and indicated that they helped him make this
discovery.&nbsp; Microsoft has not yet commented on this, so the status of a fix
is unknown.&nbsp; Fortunately, there are two workarounds: (1) disable
JavaScript; or (2) go into the Tools menu, then Internet Options.&nbsp; Click on
the Security tab, then Custom Level, and set <b>Allow paste operations via
script </b>to either <b>Prompt or Disable.</b>

is an updated version of MSHTML.DLL, IE's HTML parsing engine which corrects
three unrelated problems in the engine.</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">The first vulnerability, which was originally
    reported by <a href="http://www.pharlap.com/">Phar Lap Software</a>
    President Richard M. Smith, is a privacy issue involving the processing of
    the &quot;IMG SRC&quot; tag in HTML files.&nbsp; The IMG SRC tag identifies
    and loads images that are displayed as part of a web page.&nbsp; The
    vulnerability results because the tag can be used to point to files of any
    type -- not just image files -- at which point document object model methods
    can be used to determine information about the file.&nbsp; A malicious web
    site could use this vulnerability to determine the size, date and other
    information about files on the computer of a visiting user.&nbsp; The
    malicious web site would have to know the name of each file, and it wouldn't
    be able to read, change or transmit the files.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">The second vulnerability is a the variant of the
    previously-identified cross-frame security vulnerability which was reported
    by Georgi Guninski.&nbsp; A particular malformed URL can be used to execute
    a Java scriplet in the security context of a different domain.&nbsp; This
    allows a malicious web site to execute a scriptlet on a visiting user's
    machine as though it were from a trusted site.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">The third vulnerability affects only IE 5.0, and
    is a new variant of the previously-identified untrusted scripted paste
    vulnerability, which was also reported by Georgi Guninski. The vulnerability
    allows a malicious web site to create a particular type of web page control

<p>       <font size="2" face="Verdana">       On <b>May 4, 1999</b>, Jesse Berst's AnchorDesk issued a
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/anchordesk/story/story_3351.html">report</a>
describing a security bug they discovered in IE 5.&nbsp; This report was then
followed by a ZDNet <a href="http://www.excite.com/computers_and_internet/tech_news/zdnet/?article=/news/19990504/1014586.inp">report</a>.&nbsp;
The bug, which was uncovered by AnchorDesk Technical Director Jon DeKeles&nbsp;
and confirmed by Microsoft, affects users who share the same machine for
browsing.&nbsp; If one user goes to a web site - in particular, a Unix web site
that used the .ht access method for accepting usernames and passwords - any
other user with access to the system can also access that page, without having
to enter a username or password.&nbsp; In order to view a secure page that User
A visited, User B would have to (1) enter in the URL, (2) cancel the
username/password dialog box, and (3) click the Forward button.&nbsp; The secure
page is then retrieved from the local web cache, and displayed to User B.&nbsp;
Microsoft is currently investigating this issue.&nbsp; They agree that this is a
bug, and they are determining the extent of the breach and whether or not a
patch can be issued.&nbsp; Until such time as one is issued, you can employ one
of a couple workarounds:</font></p>

      message with a 2-digit year as part of its sent date.&nbsp; Under certain
      conditions the century date may be misinterpreted.&nbsp; If the 2-digit
      year is anything other than '99', Outlook Express assumes the century
      value is the same as the current century.&nbsp; If the current year is
      2000, and a 2-digit date is received as '97', then the year date will be
      interpreted as 2097.&nbsp; However, there is one special case when
      different logic is applied. If a 2-digit year of '99 is received and the

<br>
<font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>How Can I
      Protect Myself When Using Microsoft Internet Explorer?</i></strong></font><br>
      There's obviously no better protection than abstinence. But I would never
      suggest that someone stop surfing the Web, nor would I suggest they switch
      browsers.&nbsp; But there are some things you can do to protect yourself:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Make regular backups of you hard drive(s).
        This advice should be heeded by anyone with any kind of computer, and
        not just IE users. This is especially important for Windows9x and
        Windows NT users. There is <u><strong>NO SUBSTITUTE</strong></u> for a
        good backup.<br>
        <br>
        If you are using IE 2.0, 3.0, any version of 3.x, or 4.x, you should
        upgrade to IE5. Then apply the available patches and updates.&nbsp;
        This will protect you from most of the security issues.&nbsp; You can
        download all of patches and updates at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/default.asp">Microsoft's
        IE Site</a>. If you are using the IEAK, you can also download <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/ieak.htm">software</a>
        that will perform an in-place update or your installed IEAK.<br>
        <br>
        Familiarize yourself with the security options in Internet Explorer. You
        can get a ton of information on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/default.asp">Microsoft's
        web site</a> or in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/kb">Microsoft's
        Knowledge Base</a>.&nbsp; Of course, don't forget to check out <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/default.asp">Internet
        Explorer Home Page</a>.<br>
        <br>
        Beware when surfing. Don't just click any link unless you're pretty sure
        what is going to happen. In many cases, you can see what a link will do
        by placing your mouse over it (without clicking) and looking at the IE
        status bar (which, if turned off can be turned on from the View menu in
        IE). If you want, you can almost always see the source code for a web
        page by right-clicking in the page and selecting View Source. This will
        help you determine what a link is going to do when you click it in case
        it isn't apparent from the status bar.<br>
        <br>
        Stay informed.&nbsp; Bookmark this site! IMHO, this is one of the best
        ways to keep current on security issues that affect Internet Explorer.&nbsp;
        But keep up on your own, too. Visit the sites mentioned in this FAQ,
        search the web for more information and browse the newsgroups devoted to
        IE.&nbsp; If you find anything of importance not mentioned in this FAQ,
        send it to <a href="mailto:scott_schnoll@msn.com">me</a> for inclusion
        and I'll credit you as the source of the information.<br>
