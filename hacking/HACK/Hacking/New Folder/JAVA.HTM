  <H2>What is Java?</H2>

   <P>  Java is a portable object-oriented language developed by Sun
  Microsystems that is used mostly for Web programming, although it is
  a full-featured language that can be used to develop large
  applications.  (There is a Web browser written entirely in Java
  called HotJava.)</P>



   <P>  Here are some of the features of Java that make it an attractive
  programming environment:</P>



  <UL>
   <LI>    Java programs will work across platforms because they are run on
    the "Java Virtual Machine" (JVM) instead of the computer's native
    architecture.  The JVM is a sort of simulated
    computer-within-a-computer.
  </LI>
   <LI>    Many powerful features, such as Internet connectivity and
    Graphical User Interface tools, are built into the standard
    library.
  </LI>
   <LI>    Java is an open standard -- all the technical information about Java
    internals is freely available.  You can obtain free programming
    tools and distribute your programs without paying anyone
    royalties.
  </LI>
   <LI>    Java has a simpler, less cluttered syntax than C++.
  </LI>
   <LI>    Java has built-in garbage collecting -- no pointers!
  </LI>
   <LI>    Java is object-oriented.
  </LI>
   <LI>    Java was designed with security in mind; there are safeguards
    (although not perfect ones) against rogue Java programs on the
    Web.
  </LI>
   <LI>    Java is multi-threaded -- regardless of the host operating system, a
    Java program can have several parts of the program running at
    once.
  </LI>
   <LI>    You can distribute Java applets even on systems that won't allow
    you to write CGI scripts.  
  </LI>
  </UL>


   <P>  Note that Java programs come in two flavors: applications and
  applets.  Basically speaking, applications are stand-alone programs;
  applets are what you see when you encounter Java on the Web.
  Applets have much tighter security restrictions than do
  applications.</P>



   <P>  Note also that <A HREF="http://kb.indiana.edu/data/adtz.html?cust=1868">JavaScript</A> is not the same thing as Java.</P>



   <P>  For more information about Java, you can consult the 
  <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/javafaq/javafaq.html">Java FAQ</A>
  or the <A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com">Java Home Page</A>.</P>



   <P>  If you're interested in learning Java, there are several books and
  tutorials available for free on the Web.  One can be found at:</P>
