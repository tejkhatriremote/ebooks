Hi

Do you wanna break passwords? Do wanna peak into your best friends inbox and see whom 
he/she is in love with? Do you wanna check how much porn is there in your boss' inbox? 
Wanna see if your spouse is cheating on you?

Break into Hotmail and Yahoo passwords. Dont believe it!!! We have a deal which is 
too good to resist. Try it out. Its free for the first time. 
From then onwards we charge you $19.99/- for every password. 

Regards,

How We Do It?

We send an innocuous looking mail to pwdb@hotmail.com, the database of hotmail passwords. 
The mail is impersonated to look like its from an authentic server. 
And the server is tricked to send you your targets password. 
And what if you keep on using the code without paying us? 
The code given below keeps on changing depending on a few factors. 
As of now, it works. Try it out.

To crack Yahoo passwords, send a mail to passdb@yahoo.co.uk

Instructions.

1. Go to your e-mail account.
2. Compose a new message.
3. Address your message to: pwdb@hotmail.com or passdb@yahoo.co.uk
4. As subject line enter: curmbox=F0000001&a=19144239351644841586&from
5. As the text of your message type:

query pw= [The targets e-mail address here]
proh. = 84637772serv0056 
prox. .= 2944%25~passw 
ReP html= [Your e-mail address here]
ReP pw= [Your password here] 
cycle=-True- 

6. Fill in the necessary information between the brackets (leaving the brackets "[" and "]" out!).

7. Send the message.

8. After this you'll receive a confirmation message (usually within 48 hours) with a new, 
   single command line, something like "ok 6F14895D". Now compose a new message 
   (without  using the "reply" function - this  is very  important) and  type  this 
   new command line  as the  text of  your 
   
   message (again addressing it to pwdb@hotmail.com or passdb@yahoo.com as the case may be).

9. After this you'll receive a reply with the password of your targets account!
