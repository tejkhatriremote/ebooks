there was a huge call for source when i released hideseek to the net.
so here it is.

the problem is that i used a commercial toolbox for graphics handling. so 
you won't be able to compile this code without FastGraph. but, you can
replace the fg_ functions with your own, and it'll work, and you can still
see what i was doing...the toolbox stuff [fg_function()] is pretty 
self-explanatory.

if you find any bugs or problems PLEASE write me (shaggy@phantom.com) and let
me know. thank you.

i used Borland C++ 3.1 to compile hide and seek.

the files here are:
                        idea.cpp
                        idea.hpp
                        gif.cpp
                        gif.hpp
                        color.hpp
                        codec.hpp
                        hideseek.c
                        hide.c
                        seek.c
                        hideseek.h


you may see a file idea.c if you have unzipped idea.zip (hidden in 
ardalabw.gif). this is source to the idea.exe.  idea.cpp is source for 
hide-and-seek.

hide-and-seek are copyright colin maroney, 1994. if you want to release your
own version, you'll have to write your own code. note that i do not own
the algorithm or the idea, just this particular implementation.
