can use WinU to allow employees to run only authorized software, making other programs
unavailable. WinU is also ideal for public-access computers. You can let patrons
use your computers without worrying that they might change the computer's setup or
delete important files.</P>

can encrypt individual cells in a spreadsheet or encrypt the entire spreadsheet.
PrivaSuite makes compartmentalization of information simple and fast. You can encrypt
individual clauses in a contract, encrypt the whole contract, or do both--multilayer
encryption is effortless with PrivaSuite. You can encrypt files saved on your hard
drive or on the network for &quot;eyes only&quot; access and encrypt hard-copy documents
so that only you and the intended recipient can read them. In short, if the information
is on your computer, PrivaSuite can encrypt it with just 2-3 keystrokes, and with
virtually no interruption to your workflow. The program works in Microsoft Windows
3.<I>x</I> and 95 and employs a 56-bit DES engine (wherever allowed) or 40-bit international
engine.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>Cetus StormWindows</B></FONT></H3>
<P>Cetus StormWindows&amp;tm; for Windows 95 allows authorized users to add several
types and degrees of protections to the desktop and system of a Windows 95 computer.
Intelligent use of StormWindows security measures will allow secure use of any shared
Windows 95 PC (a version for Windows NT 4 is under development). Examples of desktop
protections include

<UL>
	<LI>Hiding all desktop icons
	<LI>Hiding Start menu programs groups and links
	<LI>Preventing the saving of desktop changes
	<LI>Hiding all drives in My Computer
	<LI>Hiding the Start menu settings folders (Control Panel and printers) and taskbar
	<LI>Hiding Network Neighborhood
</UL>

<P>Some of the system protections include

<UL>
	<LI>Disabling the MS-DOS prompt and the exiting to MS-DOS mode
	<LI>Preventing warm booting (Ctrl+Alt+Del)
	<LI>Blocking the running of Registration Editor and System Policy Editor
	<LI>Preventing the merging of REG files into the Registry
	<LI>Preventing the addition or deletion of printers
	<LI>Keeping the Documents menu empty
	<LI>Hiding sensitive Control Panel pages and settings
</UL>

<P>StormWindows security schemes can be imported from and exported to other computers
by disk. StormWindows changes do not require the use of policies. StormWindows protections
would probably be most useful to someone in charge of a number of computers at a
school or business, a network manager, or a parent. Access to StormWindows is password
protected.</P>

<P>Windows Enforcer, version 4.0 (<TT>enforcer.zip</TT>) protects systems that are
accessible to many people and require a consistent configuration and a consistent
limited selection of services such as public displays or computer labs. It is also
great for child-proofing individual systems. This is accomplished by ensuring that
user-specified tasks either never run, always run, or are allowed to run. It is easy
to configure and requires little or no modifications to your current system configuration.
Optional user-specified sounds for the startup and access-denied events are also
available. Online help is provided. (Windows 3.<I>x</I> and Windows 95.)</P>

<P>SATAN recognizes several common networking-related security problems and reports
them without actually exploiting them. For each type of problem found, SATAN offers
a tutorial that explains the problem and what its impact could be. The tutorial also
explains what can be done about the problem. SATAN collects information that is available
to everyone with access to the network. With a properly configured firewall in place,
that should be near-zero information for outsiders. SATAN will inevitably find problems.
Here's the current problem list:

<UL>
	<LI>NFS file systems exported to arbitrary hosts
	<LI>NFS file systems exported to unprivileged programs
	<LI>NFS file systems exported via the portmapper
	<LI>NIS password file access from arbitrary hosts
	<LI>Old (before 8.6.10) sendmail versions
	<LI>REXD access from arbitrary hosts
	<LI>X server access control disabled
	<LI>Arbitrary files accessible via TFTP
	<LI>Remote shell access from arbitrary hosts
	<LI>Writable anonymous FTP home directory

<P>Strobe is a network/security tool that locates and describes all listening TCP
ports on a (remote) host or on many hosts in a manner that maximizes bandwidth utilization
and minimizes process resources manner. Strobe approximates a parallel finite state
machine internally. In nonlinear multihost mode, it attempts to apportion bandwidth
and sockets among the hosts very efficiently. This can reap appreciable gains in
speed for multiple distinct hosts/routes. On a machine with a reasonable number of
sockets, strobe is fast enough to port scan entire Internet subdomains. It is even
possible to survey an entire small country in a reasonable time from a fast machine
on the network backbone, provided the machine in question uses dynamic socket allocation
or has had its static socket allocation increased very appreciably (check your kernel
options). Strobe is said to be faster than ISS2.1 (a high quality commercial security
scanner by <TT>cklaus@iss.net</TT> and friends) or PingWare (also commercial). Author:

<P>SAFEsuite&amp;tm; is a family of network security assessment tools designed to
audit, monitor, and correct all aspects of network security. Internet Scanner is
the fastest, most comprehensive, proactive UNIX and Windows NT security scanner available.
It configures easily, scans quickly, and produces comprehensive reports. Internet
Scanner probes a network environment for selected security vulnerabilities, simulating
the techniques of a determined intruder. Depending on the reporting options selected,
Internet Scanner provides information about each vulnerability found: location, in-depth
description, and suggested corrective actions.</P>

<P>The following NetWare utilities are on the CD-ROM. This listing provides contact
information for each company and a description of its product.
<H3><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>SecureConsole</B></FONT></H3>
<P>SecureConsole for NetWare is a fileserver console security application that adds
a new level of control and accountability to the NetWare server. It restricts access
for individual users or NetWare security groups to specific server commands or applications.
SecureConsole also records the commands performed by each logon. SecureConsole acts
like a screen saver on the console forcing the user to identify himself with a valid
NetWare login and password. If the user is authorized to access the server, SecureConsole
unlocks the screen but continues to verify the user's actions against his list of
authorized functions and application screens. This means that different users or
groups can have different levels of access. Installation of SecureConsole is simple!
The software can be installed through the NetWare v4 product installation program
or by copying the program to the server manually. No special NetWare queues, setup
files, or license files are required, and the product is <I>not</I> serialized. This
allows for software distribution products or batch installation to multiple fileservers.</P>
