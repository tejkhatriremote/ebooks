</CENTER>
<P>More than 50 percent of all users have heard of firewalls, but only a handful
know what a firewall really is. This is because firewalls are only used by those
actively engaged in protecting networks connected to the Internet.
<H2><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>What Is a Firewall?</B></FONT></H2>
<P>A <I>firewall</I> is any device used to prevent outsiders from gaining access
to your network. This device is usually a combination of software and hardware. Firewalls
commonly implement exclusionary schemes or rules that sort out wanted and unwanted
addresses.</P>
<P>To understand how firewalls work, consider some of the subjects discussed earlier
in this book. First, most simple authentication procedures use the IP address as
an index. The IP address is the most universal identification index on the Internet.
This address can be either a static or dynamic address:

<UL>
	<LI>A static IP address is permanent; it is the address of a machine that is always
	connected to the Internet. There are many classes of static IP addresses. One class
	can be discovered by issuing a whois query; this class consists primarily of top-level
	machines in a network, such as domain name servers, Web servers, and root-level machines.
	These actually have registered hostnames within the whois database at InterNIC. Other
	classes of static IP addresses are addresses assigned to second- and third-level
	machines within networks dominated by domain name servers, root servers, Web servers,
	and so on. These also have permanent physical addresses. However, these machines
	might or might not possess a registered hostname. In any event, their addresses are
	registered as well.<BR>
	<BR>
	
	<LI>A dynamic IP address is one that is arbitrarily assigned to a different node
	each time it connects to a network. Dynamic IP is often used by ISPs for dial-up
	access--each time a node dials up, it is assigned a different IP address.
</UL>

<P>Whether your address is static or dynamic, it is used in all network traffic that
you conduct. For example, as discussed in Chapter 13, &quot;Techniques to Hide One's
Identity,&quot; a Web server records your IP address when you request a Web page.
This is not to intrude on your privacy; it is done so that the server knows how to
send you the requested data. In a similar fashion, all network services capture your
IP (either temporarily or permanently) so they can return data to your address. In
essence, it works much like the postal service: Imagine if every letter mailed had
a return address. On the Internet, things are just so. The IP is the return address.</P>
<P>When a connection is made between your machine and a remote machine, various dialogs
may ensue. I discussed some of those dialogs in Chapter 6, &quot;A Brief Primer on
TCP/IP.&quot; A common one--which you are apt to remember--is the TCP/IP three-way
handshake. At any rate, such dialogs occur, during which time your IP is known by
the target machine.</P>
<P>Under normal circumstances, where no firewall or other superseding utility (such
as TCP_Wrapper) has been installed, the dialog between your machine and the remote
machine occurs directly (see Figure 27.1).</P>
<P><A NAME="01"></A><A HREF="01-15.htm" tppabs="http://pbs.mcp.com/ebooks/1575212684/ch27/01.htm"><B>FIGURE 27.1.</B></A> <I><BR>
The route of information.</I></P>
<P>When I say that information travels directly, that is a very qualified term. As
you can see, the process (even without security measures) is complex:

<DL>
	<DD><B>1. </B>The data originates somewhere within <TT>Your Network</TT> (which,
	by the way, could refer to a machine in your home). In this case, you are connected
	to your provider's network. For our purposes, your provider's network <I>is</I> <TT>Your
	Network</TT>.<BR>
	<BR>
	<B>2. </B>Information travels from your machine to a machine on the provider's network.
	From there, the information travels through an Ethernet cable (or other means of
	transport) to the main server of <TT>Your Network</TT>.<BR>
	<BR>
	<B>3. </B>The server of <TT>Your Network</TT> passes this information to Router 1,
	which promptly pours the information through the telephone line (or other high-speed
	connection) to the Internet at large.<BR>
	<BR>
	<B>4. </B>The information travels across the Internet (passing through many routers
	and gateways along the way), ultimately reaching Router 2. Router 2 pipes the information
	into <TT>Their Server</TT>; the information is then served via Ethernet (or other
	transport) to <TT>Their Network</TT>.
</DL>

<FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>NOTE:</B></FONT><B> </B>I have greatly simplified the network
	outlay design by providing only relevant details. In practice, there might be all
	sorts of devices located between <TT>Your Network</TT> and <TT>Their Network</TT>.
	
<HR>


</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If neither side has installed security measures, the path is deemed (for all purposes)
<I>direct</I>. Router 2, for example, allows packets from any source (IP) address
to travel directly to <TT>Their Server</TT> and ultimately, to <TT>Their Network</TT>.
At no point during that travel do the packets meet an obstacle. This is a completely
insecure situation. However, for many years, this was the standard. Today, the type
of situation illustrated in Figure 27.1 is too dangerous. Over the years, network
engineers considered a wide range of solutions, including the firewall.
<H2><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>What Are the Components of a Firewall?</B></FONT></H2>
<P>The most fundamental components of a firewall exist neither in software nor hardware,
but inside the mind of the person constructing it. A firewall, at its inception,
is a concept rather than a product; it is an idea in the architect's mind of who
and what will be allowed to access the network. <I>Who</I> and <I>what</I> dramatically
influence how network traffic (both incoming and outgoing) is routed. For this reason,
constructing a firewall is part art, part common sense, part ingenuity, and part
logic.</P>
<P>Suppose the architect knows a Web server must exist on the host network. This
Web server will obviously accept connections from almost any IP address. A restricted
area, therefore, must be created for that server. In other words, in providing Web
services from the host network, the architect must ensure that the Web server does
not endanger the remaining portions of the network. Likewise, incoming mail is also
an issue.
<H3><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>Specific Components and Characteristics</B></FONT></H3>
<P>Firewalls can be composed of software, hardware, or, most commonly, both. The
software components can be either proprietary, shareware, or freeware. The hardware
can be any hardware that supports the software being used.</P>
<P>If hardware, a firewall can (and often does) consist of no more than a router.
As you will learn in Chapter 28, &quot;Spoofing Attacks,&quot; routers have advanced
security features, including the capability to screen IP addresses. This screening
process allows you to define which IP addresses are allowed to connect and which
are not.</P>
<P>Other implementations consist of both hardware and software. (These can get pretty
eclectic. I have seen people using 386 boxes with shareware firewall/bridge products
on them.)</P>
<P>In any event, all firewalls share a common attribute: the capability to discriminate
or the capability to deny access generally based on source address.
<H2><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>Types of Firewalls</B></FONT></H2>
<P>There are different kinds of firewalls, and each type has its advantages and disadvantages.
The most common type is referred to as a <I>network-level firewall</I>. Network-level
firewalls are usually router based. That is, the rules of who and what can access
your network is applied at the router level. This scheme is applied through a technique
called <I>packet filtering</I>, which is the process of examining the packets that
come to the router from the outside world.</P>
<P>In a router-based firewall implementation, the source address of each incoming
connection (that is, the address from which the packets originated) is examined.
After each IP source address has been identified, whatever rules the architect has
instituted will be enforced. For example, perhaps the architect decides that no network
traffic will be accepted from any address within Microsoft Corporation. Thus, the
router rejects any packets forwarded from <TT>microsoft.com</TT>. These packets never
reach the internal server or the network beneath it.


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>
<HR>
<FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>NOTE:</B></FONT><B> </B>Routers are about the size of a
	small printer. Generally, at the back of the router are connection points for Ethernet
	and digital telephone lines. Use these connection points to connect the telephone
	line (T1, T3, and so on) and Ethernet to your server. Routers are configured using
	special software. In most instances, the software is quite easy to use. Most newer
	implementations are controlled through a windowed interface (such as the X Window
	system, OpenWindows, and so on). Routers range in price (from used to new) from $600
	to $1800. 
<HR>


</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Router-based firewalls are fast. Because they only perform cursory checks on the
source address, there is no real demand on the router. It takes no time at all to
identify a bad or restricted address. Nevertheless, the speed comes with a price:
Router-based firewalls use the source address as an index. That means (barring controls
against such access) packets sent from forged source addresses can gain at least
some level of access to your server.</P>
<P>In fairness, many packet-filtering techniques can be employed with router-based
firewalls that shore up this weakness. The IP address header is not the only field
of a packet that can be trapped by a router. As packet-filtering technology becomes
more sophisticated, so do the schemes or rules employed by an administrator. One
can now even apply rules related to state information within packets, using indexes
such as time, protocol, ports, and so forth.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>However, these are not the only deficiencies of packet-filtering, router-based
firewalls. For example:

<DL>
	<DD>Another problem is that a number of RPC (Remote Procedure Call) services are
	very difficult to filter effectively because the associated servers listen at ports
	that are assigned randomly at system startup. A service known as portmapper maps
	initial calls to RPC services to the assigned service numbers, but there is no such
	equivalent for a packet filtering router. Since the router cannot be told which ports
	the services reside at, it isn't possible to block completely these services unless
	one blocks all UDP packets (RPC services mostly use UDP). Blocking all UDP would
	block potentially necessary services such as DNS. Thus, blocking RPC results in a
	dilemma.

<P>Wack discusses RPC as a potential problem because the ports can be assigned dynamically
at startup. However, in most cases, this type of filtering (appropriately called
<I>protocol filtering</I>) is not a problem. Very sophisticated schemes can be implemented
in protocol filtering, and these rely primarily on the port called by the remote
host.

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>Packet Filtering Tools</B></FONT></H3>
<P>Packet filtering can be implemented without instituting a complete firewall. There
are many free and commercial packet-filtering tools on the Internet. Following is
a list of several such utilities.
<H4><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>TCP_Wrappers</B></FONT></H4>
<P>TCP_Wrappers is a program written by Wietse Venema (also the co-author of the
famous scanning utility, SATAN). Arguably, no other tool more easily or efficiently
facilitates monitoring connections to your machine. The program works by replacing
system daemons and recording all connection requests, their time, and most importantly,
their origin. For these reasons, TCP_Wrappers is one of the most critical evidence-gathering
tools available. TCP_Wrappers also has the capability to screen out unwanted networks
and IP addresses, preventing users from such addresses from connecting.

<P>NetGate (developed by SmallWorks) is a rule-based packet filtering system. It
was designed for use on SPARC systems running SunOS 4.1.<I>x</I>. Like most packet
filters, NetGate can examine each and every packet it encounters and can apply various
rules, based upon the source address revealed in that examination. (NetGate also
sports some pretty strong logging capabilities.) Reportedly, the distribution can
be obtained either as a binary installation ($1500) or source ($2500). If your company
needs a product with support (as opposed to freeware), I would recommend NetGate
as a reasonable and economical alternative to other, more high-profile products.

Packet Filter has all the amenities of a finely coded, commercial application. (Reed
took particular pride in developing a package that could defeat the type of IP spoofing
attack that Kevin Mitnik purportedly launched against machines at the San Diego Supercomputer
Center.) Some interesting tidbits: Reed provided functionality not only to discard
TCP packets that were incomplete or malformed, but to do so silently (your host returns
no ICMP error). Internet Packet Filter also offers a comprehensive testing utility,
so you can ensure your rules are sound before you implement them. (The program actually
can take previous logs as input, and you can watch as the rules are applied. Very
cool.) It is available for SunOS.

<P>Nonetheless, many of these tools, although capable of examining and monitoring
packet traffic, cannot institute access-control policies. And that is the whole purpose
of a firewall. It gives the administrator the ability to finely control who can (and
cannot) access the network.
<H3><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>Application-Proxy Firewalls/Application Gateways</B></FONT></H3>
<P>Other types of firewalls exist. A common type is <I>application-proxy firewalls</I>
(sometimes referred to as <I>application gateways</I>). These work a bit differently
from packet-filtering, router-based firewalls. Application gateways are software-based.
When a remote user from the void contacts a network running an application gateway,
the gateway blocks the remote connection. Instead of passing the connection along,
the gateway examines various fields in the request. If these meet a set of predefined
rules, the gateway creates a bridge between the remote host and the internal host.
<I>Bridge</I> refers to a patch between two protocols. For example, in a typical
application gateway scheme, IP packets are not forwarded to the internal network.
Instead, a type of translation occurs, with the gateway as the conduit and interpreter.
This is sometimes referred to as the <I>man-in-the-middle configuration</I>.</P>
<P>The advantage of the application-gateway proxy model is the lack of IP forwarding.
More importantly, more controls can be placed on the patched connection. Finally,
such tools often offer very sophisticated logging facilities. Again, there is no
such thing as a free lunch. As you might expect, this gateway scheme has a cost in
terms of speed. Because each connection and all packet traffic are accepted, negotiated,
translated, and reforwarded, this implementation can be slower than router-based
packet filtering.</P>
<P><I>IP forwarding</I> occurs when a server that receives an external request from
the outside world forwards that information in IP format to the internal network.
Leaving IP forwarding enabled is a fatal error. If you allow IP forwarding to occur,
a cracker can get in from the outside and reach workstations on your internal network.</P>
<P>Another disadvantage of this scheme is that a proxy application must be created
for each networked service. Thus, one is used for FTP, another for Telnet, another
for HTTP, and so forth. As John Wack explains in his article titled &quot;Application
Gateways&quot;:

<DL>
	<DD>A disadvantage of application gateways is that, in the case of client-server
	protocols such as Telnet, two steps are required to connect inbound or outbound.
	Some application gateways require modified clients, which can be viewed as a disadvantage
	or an advantage, depending on whether the modified clients make it easier to use
	the firewall. A Telnet application gateway would not necessarily require a modified
	Telnet client, however it would require a modification in user behavior: the user
	has to connect (but not log in) to the firewall as opposed to connecting directly
	to the host. But a modified Telnet client could make the firewall transparent by
	permitting a user to specify the destination system (as opposed to the firewall)
	in the Telnet command. The firewall would serve as the route to the destination system
	and thereby intercept the connection, and then perform additional steps as necessary
	such as querying for a one-time password. User behavior stays the same, however at
	the price of requiring a modified client on each system.

<P>A typical example of an application-gateway firewall package is the Trusted Information
Systems (TIS) Firewall Tool Kit (hereinafter referred to as the <I>FWTK</I>). This
software package, early versions of which are free for noncommercial use, contains
many separate components. The majority of these components are proxy applications.
It includes proxies for the following services:

<UL>
	<LI>Telnet
	<LI>FTP
	<LI>rlogin
	<LI>sendmail
	<LI>HTTP
	<LI>The X Window system
</UL>

<P>The FWTK is a comprehensive system. Nonetheless, it does not protect your network
immediately upon installation. This is not a product that you simply install and
abandon. The TIS FWTK is a <I>tool kit</I>. After you unpack the software, you must
make certain decisions. You must also understand what you are doing. This is not
a simple configuration problem. If you make erroneous rules or decisions along the
way, your network might be unreachable from the void, even from friendly networks.
Reading the documentation is paramount.</P>
<P>The beautiful thing about the FWTK is that it has excellent access control built
into its design. For example, you can allow or deny access (connection) from a network,
a part of a network, or even a single address. In this respect, it has granular access
control.</P>

<P>It is my opinion that application-gateway systems (proxy-based firewalls) are
more secure. This is because there is no IP forwarding scheme. That means IP packets
from the void cannot reach any machine on your internal network.
<H2><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>Firewalls Generally</B></FONT></H2>
<P>One of the main ideas behind a firewall is that your network will remain theoretically
invisible (or at least unreachable) to anyone not authorized to connect. This process
works through the exclusionary schemes that one can apply using a firewall.


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>
<HR>
<FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>CAUTION:</B></FONT><B> </B>Your firewalled network will
	not be entirely invisible. At least one scanner, called <I>Jakal</I>, can scan for
	services running behind a firewall. Jakal, a stealth scanner, will scan a domain
	(behind a firewall) without leaving any trace of the scan. According to the authors,
	all alpha test sites were unable to log any activity (though it is reported that
	&quot;some firewalls did allow SYN | FIN to pass through&quot;). Refer to Chapter
	9, &quot;Scanners,&quot; for the scoop on that utility. 
<HR>


</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Theoretically, a firewall is the most stringent security measure you can implement
(barring, of course, disconnecting your system from the Internet). Nevertheless,
issues regarding this stringent security environment remain. One is that security
with a firewall can be configured so stringently that it can actually impair the
process of networking. For example, some studies suggest that the use of a firewall
is impractical in environments where users critically depend on distributed applications.
Because firewalls implement such a strict security policy, these environments become
bogged down. What they gain in security, they lose in functionality. Universities
are a perfect example of this type of environment. Research in universities is often
conducted where two or more departments (often on network segments located far from
each other) are involved in the compilation of data (and corroboration of research
efforts). In these environments, it is very difficult to work under such tight security
restraints.</P>
<P>A second issue regarding firewalls is that they lead to placing most of your eggs
in one basket. Because a firewall is your face to the void, a breach can cause your
internal network to be easily destroyed. That is, firewalls can foster a climate
in which they are the only real access control and security you have. Firewalls are
almost always described as the bottleneck of a network, where all authentication
is to be done. This seems suitable as long as firewalls are infallible. But what
if they aren't? What if a technique is discovered to crack any firewall? Networks
that rely on firewalls would be completely exposed, and odds of survival would be
slim.</P>
<P>Before you construct a firewall, you should undertake some serious research. When
you construct a firewall, you must know your network intimately. This requires true
organization. Various network segments (either on the same network or different ones)
will need to communicate with each other. These networks can communicate through
automated processes or human interaction. Automated processes might prove easy to
accommodate. Human-initiated processes, however, can differ dramatically.</P>
<P>For some organizations, a firewall is just plain impractical. ISPs are within
this class. One could quickly lose customers by instituting harsh security policies.
Indeed, some contend that firewalls are not needed. These people argue that solid
system administration practices will render the same benefit as a firewall, without
slowing the network or making connections difficult.</P>
<P>There are other problems with establishing a firewall as well. If FTP, Telnet,
Gopher, HTTP, RPC, rlogin, and NFS were the only protocols that the Internet would
ever use, a firewall would pose only limited problems with access. After all, proxies
have been written for all of these applications. The problem is, these are not the
only services; new services crop up each month. Thus, to provide your internal users
with effective Internet access, you must keep up with the applications now emerging.
Proxies for such services will generally be obtainable, but after the new service
or protocol has already been on the market for some time. Of course, <I>some time</I>
is generally only a few months, but during those months, your internal users will
fuss.
<H2><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>Building a Firewall: What You Need to Know</B></FONT></H2>
<P>The construction of a firewall is not for the faint of heart. It is for a system
administrator (or other individual) who <I>intimately</I> knows the network to be
firewalled. The process is not simple; the steps include

<DL>
	<DD><B>1. </B>Identifying topology and protocol needs<BR>
	<BR>
	<B>2.</B> Developing policies<BR>
	<BR>
	<B>3. </B>Having adequate tools<BR>
	<BR>
	<B>4.</B> Using those tools effectively<BR>
	<BR>
	<B>5. </B>Testing the configuration
</DL>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>Identifying Topology and Protocol Needs</B></FONT></H3>
<P>The first step is to understand the network in its entirety. This task might involve
more than simply looking over the machines, the logs, and so forth. It might involve
discussing these matters with individual departments. For example, in larger networks,
there might be many interactions between a specific department in one building and
a specific department in another. These buildings might be located hundreds or even
thousands of miles away from each other. You need to know what type of outgoing traffic
users require.</P>
<P>It is important to maintain your tact during this process. You will often run
into users who insist, &quot;We've been doing it this way for 10 years now.&quot;
Even though you have great authority (because security is such a serious concern),
you should work with these people as much as possible. It is not necessary that they
understand the process in full. Nevertheless, if you intend to restrict or otherwise
hamper their ability to reach out into the void, you should explain why to them.
The last thing you need is to anger (or otherwise foster resentment within) local
users. Rather, you need their support because after you finish building your firewall,
you will distribute a policy. How closely local users follow that policy will dramatically
affect the security of your network. For example, if insecure modems are located
in this or that department, this is a potential hole. If you have dealt tactfully
with local users, you will probably have nothing to fear. However, if you have issued
Draconian decrees, you can be pretty sure that local users will trip you up.


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>
<HR>
<FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>NOTE:</B></FONT><B> </B>I hear folks dispute this all the
	time. They insist that no one can simply install a modem on a machine. Why not? I
	have seen it happen in many companies. There is nothing in a policy alone that will
	prevent an employee from doing so. Furthermore, on networks with PC-based workstations,
	many machines or workstations have internal modems to begin with. I dealt with one
	client who had a Novell NetWare network from the old days. Even the client was unaware
	that some machines had modems (1200 baud, of course).

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>So, your first job is to determine what can and cannot be restricted. A list should
be made of all nonstandard protocols that are essential between this network and
any other. That done, you can begin to get a picture of how the firewall will be
built (at least, the local access policies). Determining whom (or what) not to let
in is a little less perplexing. More than likely, you will want to restrict connections
from any network known to forward unsolicited e-mail, sexual content, or other materials
not related to your business. You might also want to restrict addresses that are
known hacking or cracking havens.


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>
<HR>
<FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>NOTE:</B></FONT><B> </B>I would restrict all known hacking
	and cracking addresses. For example, a well- known hacking group recently conducted

	caused a stir in security-related mailing lists and newsgrouqa and rightly so.

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>Are Firewalls Foolproof?</B></FONT></H3>
<P>Are firewalls foolproof? Are humans foolproof? The answer to both questions is
no. Firewall products have not been proven to be flawed, but human implementation
has. Crackers have conducted various studies on breaking firewalls. The majority
of those studies point to two phases of an attack. The first is to discover what
type of firewall exists on a particular network and what type of services are running
behind it. That first task has already been encapsulated in an automated package;
the Jakal scanner can accomplish this for you.</P>
<P>The second task, finding a hole in the firewall, is a bit more difficult. Cracker
studies indicate that if there is such a hole, it exists as a result of human error
(or rather, misconfiguration on the part of the system administrator). This is not
a rare occurrence. One must recognize that no matter what platform is in use, this
is a problem. In UNIX networks, it can be at least partially attributed to the fact
that UNIX is so complex. There are hundreds of native applications, protocols, and
commands. This is before you begin to construct a firewall. Failed firewall implementation
on Microsoft platforms might occur for other reasons (for instance, because administrators
might be unfamiliar with TCP/IP). In either case, human error is a likely possibility.
For this reason, companies should be extremely selective when choosing the personnel
responsible for implementing the firewall. Some common cracker agendas include

<UL>
	<LI>Sorting out the real components from the fake ones--Many firewalls use <I>sacrificial
	hosts</I>, machines designed either as Web servers (that the owners are willing to
	part with) or decoys. <I>Decoys</I> are nothing more than traps, places where an
	inexperienced cracker's activities are captured and logged. These can employ complex
	means of veiling their bogus character. For example, they might issue responses to
	emulate a real file system or real applications. These generally are deeply entrenched
	in a chroot'd environment. The cracker's first task is to identify what viable targets
	might actually exist.

<P>Also, no firewall can effectively prevent attacks from the inside. If a cracker
can place someone (perhaps himself or herself) in your employ, it won't be long before
your network is cracked. I know someone who managed to gain employment with a well-known
oil company. That hacker collected extensive information not only about the internal
network there, but also about the firewall hosts.</P>
<P>Finally, firewalls have been bypassed or broken in the past. The Quake site at
Crack dot Com is one such example. Although relatively little information has been
distributed about how the crack was accomplished, it was reported in <I>Wired</I>
that:

<DL>
	<DD>Hackers broke into the Web server and file server of Crack dot Com, a Texas gaming

<P>One of the more interesting elements of Check Point Firewall-1 is that it includes
time object control. That is, one can assign certain times of the day to perform
certain access restrictions. Firewall-1 also has provisions to distribute process
loads among a series of workstations.</P>

<P>Sun's SunScreen is comprised of a series of products. In the SunScreen product
line, Sun has addressed one of the primary problems I mentioned previously: If your
bottleneck is broken, your network is completely exposed. Sun's new line of products
will likely revolutionize the firewall industry (certainly on the Sun platform).
The chief products include

<UL>
	<LI>SunScreen SPF 100/100G--Turnkey solution that provides non-IP-address capability.
	That is, crackers from the outside cannot reliably identify the nodes behind the
	wall. Moreover, heavy packet-filtering technology has been added.<BR>
	<BR>
	
	<LI>SunScreen<FONT SIZE="1"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> EFS--Implements heavy-duty packet
	filtering and more importantly, encryption. Special amenities include provisions
	for remote administration and administration through an HTML interface.

<P>This firewall relies not on application proxies (which can consume additional
network resources and CPU time) but instead on a secure operating system within the
hardware component itself. Special features include an HTML configuration and administration
control tool, IP concealment and non-translation, easy configuration, and support
for 16,000 instant connections.
<H2><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>Summary</B></FONT></H2>
<P>Firewalls now comprise the most commonly accepted method of protecting a network
and, for the most part, seem to be impenetrable when attacked by 95 percent of the
cracking community. Moreover, firewall technology is yet in its infancy. Nevertheless,
firewalls have been cracked in the past. It is also worth noting that some firewalls
can raise security issues themselves. For example, it was recently found that the
Gopher proxy in a Raptor product can, under certain circumstances, leave a Windows
NT server vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack. (The CPU climbs to near 100 percent
utilization.)</P>
<P>The future of firewall technology is a very interesting field indeed. However,
if you have truly sensitive data to protect (and it must be connected to the Internet),
I advise against using a firewall (commercial or otherwise) as your only means of
defense.
