= Overview =

Proactive Windows Security Explorer (PWSEX) is a password security test tool that's designed to allow Windows NT, Windows 2000, and Windows XP-based systems administrators to identify and close security holes in their networks. Proactive Windows Security Explorer helps secure networks by executing an audit of account passwords, and exposing insecure account passwords. If it is possible to recover the password within a reasonable time, the password is considered insecure. The software supports a few different methods of obtaining password hashes for further attack/audit: from dump files (generated by 3rd party tools like pwdump/pwdump2/pwdump3), Registry of local computer, binary Registry files (SAM and SYSTEM), memory of local computer, and memory of remote computers (Domain Controllers), including ones running Active Directory. It can use brute-force and dictionary attacks on LM and NTLM password hashes, effectively optimized for speed.

Unregistered (trial) version of PWSEX expires in 30 days after first use, and has some limitations (see help file for more information). After you register (look at "order.txt" for details), we will send you your personal registration code. To enter it into the program, just press the "Register" button on the program toolbar on on nag screen; the program will show the small window dialog asking you to enter the code. If the code is correct, PWSEX shows the message that it is registered now, and so since than has the full functionality and never expires.
