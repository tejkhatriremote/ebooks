<DIV>
<P class=MsoNormal>Now days, almost all networks have firewalls installed to 
protect them from the dangers of the un-trusted outside world of the Internet. 
When firewalls first came to the scene, they were nowhere near good enough to 
protect the Network completely. However, with the passage of time, the quality 
of firewalls has increased to such a level that the present day firewall systems 
make the internal trusted network almost 100% safe. </P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>They can easily be configured to allow only certain kinds of 
data to pass through and even can be used to set which ports can be accessed 
from the un-trusted network (Internet) and which ports are accessible from the 
internal trusted network. Some good ones also scan all attachments going in and 
out for viruses and ensure that no confidential data is going out of the 
company. The present day firewalls have really made life quite easier for the 
system administrating by giving more than a little protection from the Outside 
world. However, one area where the firewalls falter is if the attach is from 
within the trusted internal network or in other words, the attacker is doing 
something wrong, something which he is not supposed to do from within the 
network and not through the Internet. </P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Say for example, you have a well configured; firewall 
installed at your company&#8217;s main server and it scans all incoming email 
attachments for viruses. Now, if you get a virus attach from outside the 
internal trusted network and though the Internet, then normally the firewall 
will either delete or warn you about it. However, if the virus coder, is working 
for you and is within the internal trusted network, then a firewall would not be 
able to do anything about it and the virus will spread quite easily. </P>
<P class=MsoNormal>NOTE: The above is just an example taken to ensure that you 
understand. </P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>So, now, I hope you realize that only a Firewall is not 
sufficient for a network and it also requires something for attacks from 
internal systems.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>This is where the Kerberos comes in. Kerberos is a network 
authentication protocol, which provides for the verification of identities 
within a heterogeneous distributed networked environment. It is the de facto 
standard for authentication, which gets it name from the three-headed dog in 
Greek Mythology. </P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>For complete reference and details about Kerberos 
authentication protocol, refer to the RFC 1510</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Now, within an internal network, the greatest danger lies in 
the fact that anyone can easily pick up or sniff out confidential data like 
company plans, passwords and even credit card numbers while this data is being 
transferred from one system to another within the same network. </P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Let us take an example, to understand better. Say, you are on 
a client, which is connected to the main server, which provides services to all 
clients connected to it.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Now, when 
you connect to the server to check your mail, then your email client sends your 
Username and Password to the internal network server, so that you can be 
authenticated. You may say that this is pretty much safe and how can it possible 
harm me? Well, you are wrong. Now, when your machine sends your Username and 
Password to the server, then this information does not reach the destination 
server directly. The data has to pass through other machines and sometimes if 
your network is large, then even through other servers before it reaches the 
destination.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Now, anyone having 
access to those systems through which your data passes through, can easily sniff 
out your data and in this case can find out your Username and Password, using 
which he can check your mail. </P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>To solve all the above problems (and many more) there is the 
Kerberos. The Kerberos not only ensures that no one sniffs data out, but also 
ensures the integrity of the client and server to prevent impersonation. This 
basically means that it ensures that no one can fool the server into thinking 
that it is some other system.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Now, to understand how exactly, Kerberos proves to be as good 
as it is, let us learn how the Kerberos protocol works.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>The most popular Network Authentication providing software, 
Kerberos is constituted of 3 main parts or sections-:</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal 
style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><![if !supportLists]>1.)<SPAN 
style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN><![endif]>The Authentication Server or AS</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 
style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><![if !supportLists]>2.)<SPAN 
style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN><![endif]>The Ticket Granting Server or TGS</P>
<P class=MsoNormal 
style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><![if !supportLists]>3.)<SPAN 
style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN><![endif]>The Actual Encryption process or algorithm</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>In a Network with Kerberos installed or enabled, the 
Authentication Server or the AS acts as the head or the central unit, which 
ensures the authenticity of the client and server and also prevents data 
sniffing. </P>
<P class=MsoNormal>One good thing about the Kerberos Authentication system is 
that is a dual-authentication system, which means that it not allows the server 
to verify the identity of the client but also vise-a-versa.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>The Authentication Server acts as the secretary of both the 
client and the server. The client and the server in order to communicate with 
each other, have to have a connection with the AS. (The AS verifies identities 
of both the client and the server.) Only once the AS has verified the 
authenticity of both the client and the server, can they start to communicate 
with each other.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<H3>Kerberos: The Working</H3>
<P class=MsoNormal>So when does Kerberos jump in? Well, as soon as you want to 
login and type in your Username in the space provided. As soon as you type the 
confidential information, the Kerberos sends it to the Authentication Server or 
the AS. Then, the AS replies to the client with the session key and something 
called the Ticket Granting Ticket. Both the session key and the Ticket Granting 
ticket are encrypted by the user&#8217;s key. Now, before we go on, I think there is 
need to explain certain things involved in the above process.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Now, you must remember that the client and the Authentication 
Server and the client share an encryption key, which is used to encrypt data. 
This encrypted data is understandable (de-cryptable) by only the AS and the 
client. This encryption key is generated from the User&#8217;s Password. This means 
that, passing the User&#8217;s password through a certain predefined formula derives 
this encryption key. Similarly all Servers, which provide services to clients, 
share an encryption key with the AS.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>So this system of client-AS and server-AS encryption keys 
ensures that no one else can sniff the data.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Now, we come to the Ticket Granting Ticket, which is sent 
along with the session key[The session key is sent to the client by the AS, so 
that the client can start to communicate with the Ticket Granting Server or 
TGS.] to the client by the AS. A ticket is nothing but a certificate of 
authenticity given to the client by the AS to prevent impersonation. The ticket 
is readable only by the client system for which it is meant to be and the AS. 
The Ticket Granting Ticket also makes the Kerberos system efficient as it 
removes the need of repeating the initial process again and again.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Now, once the client receives the session key and the TG 
Ticket, it derives the client&#8217;s key from the user&#8217;s password and tries to use 
this generated key to decrypt the TG Ticket and the Ticket Granting Server key 
or the TGS key. If the client is able to decrypt these two, then the password is 
correct else wrong.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Now, say you want to then, use the POP services of the mail 
server to read your mail, then what happens is that, the client sends a request 
to The Ticket Granting Server or TGS. The client encrypts important network 
information and details about the request with the TGS key and sends this 
encrypted data to it.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>If this is found to be valid, then TGS issues a ticket to the 
client which contains the following-:</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal

<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>An important thing to note here is that, for communication 
between the client and the server to actually take place, they should share the 
same key.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>The TGS generates two copies of this session key, one 
encrypted with TGS key for the client and the other with application server key. 
Using the TGS key, the client then, decrypts the session key meant for it, and 
the session key for the application server is sent to the destination.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>When the server receives the session key, and once it is 
decrypted, it knows that this particular client is trying to contact it. The 
server too has a procedure to ensure the authenticity of the client. It sends a 
random number in plain text to the client. The client then decrypts it with the 
session key (which they both have in common) and sends it back to the server. On 
receiving this encrypted text, it can ensure that the client is not an 
impersonator, as some other client cannot perform the same encryption.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Kerberos ensures that Sniffing out data is not that easy, as 
transfer of all data, even the Keys, is done in encrypted form. The encryption 
technique used by Kerberos is Data Encryption Algorithm or DES.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>However, there is still a slight hole in the Kerberos system. 
You see, during the time when the Password is sent to the AS in the first step, 
it travels through the Network in unencrypted form. This is one time, when the 
Kerberos system can be exploited.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Windows 2000 is I think the first Operating System, which 
uses Kerberos as the standard authentication method. Anyway, now that you know 
how exactly, the Kerberos Authentication System works, let us move on to how to 
find out if your ISP is running it or not? Also, I highly recommend reading the 
RFC 1510. This is for those who want even the tiniest of details about this 
system.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<H3>How do I find out if my ISP is running Kerberos?</H3>
<P class=MsoNormal>NOTE: In this section, I am assuming that you have enabled 
the Bring Up the Post Dial Up Screen option.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Well, the router of your ISP to which you initially connect 
to, holds the key. Almost all of you must have seen the Post Dial Up Screen, 
which comes up, where you have to enter your Username and Password. Now, this 
Post Dial Up Screen is actually your ISP&#8217;s router prompt. There is a secret 
(Well, not exactly secret) router command, which will let you find out if your 
ISP has implemented the Kerberos protocol.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>The following is a log which contains my comments of what I 
did to find out whether my ISP is using Kerberos or not.</P>
