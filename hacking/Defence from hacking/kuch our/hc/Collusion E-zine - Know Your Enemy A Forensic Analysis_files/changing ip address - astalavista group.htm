<P align=center><STRONG>Changing IP Addresses</STRONG></P>
<P><BR><STRONG>I. About</STRONG><BR>This is my second submission to 
Astalavista.com, my first was an explanation of using proxies on IRC. This 
tutorial will teach teach you how to change your ip address to any other one on 
your ip range instead of having your DHCP Server pick one for you. This is very 
usefull because you can change your ip when you are getting DDoS'ed or if you 
wish to piss off someone running a webserver (or other service) on your ip 
range, it is also usefull to get around a bans as long as the ban only covered 
your ip not your whole ip range.<BR><BR>As usualy anything illegal you do while 
reading this tutorial or after reading this tutorial is not my fault, your 
actions are your own so don't blame me. I do not claim that the things I teach 
are legal, so concider that everything i mention here is illegal if you are not 
sure your self.<BR><BR><STRONG>II. Needed Information</STRONG><BR>Before you can 
change your ip you need some information. This information includes your ip 
range, subnet mask, default gateway, dhcp server, and dns servers.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><BR><U>1. Getting your IP range</U> - Getting information about your ip 
  range is not difficult, I recomend using Neo Trace on your own ip. But for our 
  test just look at your ip address, say it's 24.193.110.13 you can definetly 
  use the ip's found between 24.193.110.1 &lt; [new ip] &lt; 24.193.110.255, 
  dont use x.x.x.1 or x.x.x.255. To find your ip simply open a dos/command 
  prompt window and type ipconfig at the prompt, look for "IP Address. . . . . . 
  . . . . . . : x.x.x.x".</P>
  <P><BR><U>2. Subnet Mask, Default Gateway, DHCP Server</U> - These are very 
  easy to find, just open a dos/command prompt window and type 'ipconfig /all' 
  without the ' '. You should see something like this:<BR>Windows IP 
  Configuration</P>

<P><BR>This is all the information you will need for now, I sugest you either 
keep your dos/command prompt window open or copy &amp; paste the information 
somewhere, to copy right click the window and select text and click 
once.<BR><BR><STRONG>III. Changing your IP Address</STRONG><BR>To change your ip 
address first pick any ip you like out of your ip range and remember it or write 
it down. It is usualy a good idea to make sure the ip is dead (except for what 
we are going to do later on) so just ping it via "ping x.x.x.x" and if it times 
out then you can use it. Now go to My Computer, then Control Panel. In Control 
Panel select Network Connections and pick your active connection, probably Local 
Area Connection or your ISP name. Open that connection by double clicking on the 
icon in Network Connections, then select Properties under the General Tab. In 
the new window that pops up select Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and click 
properties, it's under the general tab. In this new window select the General 
tab and choose "Use the following IP address" and for the IP address enter the 
ip you would like to use (the one you picked from your subnet earlier) and for 
the Subnet Mask enter the subnet mask you got when your ran ipconfig /all, same 
goes for the Default Gateway. Now select "Use the following DNS server 
addresses" and enter the information you got earlier. Now just click OK. Test 
that it worked, try to refresh a website and if it works you know everything is 
okay and you are connected. To make sure the change worked type ipconfig agein 
and the ip address should have changed to your new one.<BR><BR><STRONG>IV. DDoS 
&amp; DoS Protection</STRONG><BR>If your firewall shows that you are being 
ddosed, this is usualy when you are constantly getting atempted UDP connections 
several times a second from either the same ip address or multiple ip addresses 
(ddos), you can protect your self by changing your ip address via the method i 
described above.<BR><BR><STRONG>V. Webservers &amp; Other 
Services</STRONG><BR>If you know someone on your ip range is running a webserver 
and he or she has pissed you off or you just like messing around you can "steal" 
their ip address so any dns going to that ip will show your site instead because 
you would be running a webserver your self.<BR><BR>To "steal" an ip is to 
basicaly use the changing ip address method above and picking an ip that someone 
that is running a webserver has in use. Often you will be able to keep that ip 
at least for some time, other times you wont be able to use it so just keep 
trying untill it works. You your self will need to have a web server on the same 
port with your message. You can do this with other services too. You can also 
DoS or DDoS the ip address you are trying to steal to kick him off the net, but 
I dont recomend as its pretty illegal, your isp will get pissed and feds may go 
ape-shit.</P></BODY></HTML>
