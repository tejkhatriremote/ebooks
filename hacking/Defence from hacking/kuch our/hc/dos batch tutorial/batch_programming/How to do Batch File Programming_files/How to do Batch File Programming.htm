  computer program with the BAT extension. A computer program is software. It is 
  a set of instructions for the computer to carry out. DOS recognizes three 
  types of executable computer programs by their filename extension, i.e. either 
  COM , EXE or BAT.
  <P>A batch file is a text file. It consists of a batch of instructions or 
  commands that closely resemble the English language.<BR>These commands may 
  include:<BR>
  <UL>
    <LI>any command that can be used at the DOS prompt. 
    <LI>any of the DOS internal or external commands, 
    <LI>program names with the COM or EXE extension, 
    <LI>other batch file programs.</LI></UL>
  <P>COM and EXE programs are compiled programs; whereas BAT programs are 
  interpreted programs. COMMAND.COM interprets and executes the list of commands 
  in the batch file, one after the other, until they are all executed.
  <P>Batch files let you automate all your daily chores. They provide shortcuts 
  by letting DOS remember complex commands and tasks for you. Menus and 
  repetitive tasks are good candidates for batch files. The limits to the uses 
  of batch files are found only in your imagination.
  <P>We need a text editor, not a word processor, to write a batch program. Many 
  text editors are available for creating batch files. DOS provides three text 
  editors - COPY CON, EDLIN and EDIT. Most word processors have a text editing 
  mode. For example, WordPerfect's Ctrl+F5, Text In/Out, can be used for text 
  editing. The EDIT.COM programs that come with DOS 6.0 and WIN95 work with the 
  earlier versions of DOS as well. EDIT is more than adequate for creating, 
  editing and printing batch files. You may have difficulty inserting some of 
  the control characters into your text file, because the word processor or text 
  editor interprets those characters for their own specific uses.

  Subcommands</B><BR>In addition to the normal DOS commands, which includes the 
  DOS CHOICE.COM command, batch files have their own subcommand structure. Only 
  the following eight subcommands are available. Yet, these few commands give 
  you astonishing control over your computer.
  <P><A 
  href="http://members.aol.com/rick3in1/computer/batch.htm#CHOICE">CHOICE</A> 
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Allows a batch file to detect a users choice from a lits of 
  options.<BR><A 
  href="http://members.aol.com/rick3in1/computer/batch.htm#ECHO">ECHO</A> 
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Displays messages, or turns command echoing on or off.<BR><A 
  href="http://members.aol.com/rick3in1/computer/batch.htm#CALL">CALL</A> 
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Calls one batch program from inside another.<BR>GOTO &nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Directs DOS to a labelled line in a batch program.<BR>IF 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Performs conditional 
  processing in batch programs.<BR>PAUSE &nbsp; Suspends processing of a batch 
  file and displays a message.<BR>REM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Records comments 
  (remarks) in batch files or CONFIG.SYS.<BR>SHIFT &nbsp; Shifts the position of 
  replaceable parameters in batch files.<BR>FOR..IN..DO &nbsp; This integrated 
  trio allows repeated execution of a command on a specified set of files.
  <P>Note: Most of the subcommands will even work directly at the DOS prompt. A 
  batch file might not be necessary.
  <P>An easy way to create a simple batch file is to use COPY CON. For example, 
  to create TODAY.BAT, which lets you set an environment variable named, TODAY, 
  to today's date, change to the directory where you keep your batch files. 
  Then, while in DOS, type the following command and press the Enter key: COPY 
  CON TODAY.BAT
  <P>This command tells DOS to copy what you type from the keyboard into a file 
  called TODAY.BAT. If TODAY.BAT already exists on the default directory (where 
  you keep your batch files) it will be written over (lost). Now type the 
  following lines (without the line numbers, they are there for latter 
  reference):<BR><A name=TODAY></A><BR>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;@ECHO OFF<BR>2. 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ECHO/ |DATE|FIND "C"&gt;D#T.BAT<BR>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp;ECHO SET TODAY=%%4&gt;CURRENT.BAT<BR>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CALL 
  D#T<BR>5. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DEL D#T.BAT<BR>6. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DEL 
  CURRENT.BAT<BR>To save this batch file press Ctrl+Z and then the ENTER key. 
  This tells DOS to copy these six lines into TODAY.BAT and exit.
  <P>DOS exits with the message:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1 file(s) copied
  <P>Note: When using COPY CON you can only correct typing mistakes on the line 
  being typed. If you notice you made a typing mistake on a line previously 
  typed, don't worry about it, use the EDIT command to correct it after you exit 
  COPY CON.

  <P><A name=CHOICE></A><BR>Command: CHOICE<BR>Comment: The DOS program file, 
  CHOICE.COM, requires DOS 4.0 or above. If your computer does not have a 
  subdirectory of DOS program files, look in your Windows\Command folder for a 
  copy of the program.<BR>Purpose: The CHOICE command makes it possible to 
  accept various user-responses, as defined below.

  src="How to do Batch File Programming_files/download.gif" width=203 Up>
  <P><A name=ECHO></A><BR>
  <P>Command: ECHO<BR>Purpose: Displays messages, or turns command-echoing on or 
  off.
  <P>Syntax:<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ECHO [ON | OFF]<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp;ECHO<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ECHO [message]
  <P>The latter command is used to print a message to the user. It is the usual 
  way a batch file communicates information to a user.<BR>Typing ECHO without 
  parameters, as in the second syntax command above, displays the current echo 
  setting.
  <P>Comments: ECHO is primarily used to pass information to the user by sending 
  a message to the display screen.
  <P>Normally (when ECHO is ON), the DOS commands in the batch file would show 
  on the screen as if you were typing them. When Echo is ON, if you do not want 
  a particular command to be echoed, include an at sign @ character before that 
  command line.
  <P>When ECHO is off, no part of the DOS commands will show on the screen. Only 
  the message is displayed. For this reason @ECHO OFF is the first line of most 
  batch files. When you exit a batch file ECHO is automatically turned back on. 
  If you enter ECHO OFF, when at the DOS prompt, the prompt itself disappears.
  <P>Since the normal default mode is ECHO ON, the first command line of most 
  batch files is ECHO OFF; otherwise every command in the batch file will be 
  displayed to the screen before it is run. To avoid this clutter, start each 
  batch file with the command &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @ECHO OFF
  <P>A typical use of the command is to hide the switching off of the echo 
  command; as shown in line 1 of <A 
  href="http://members.aol.com/rick3in1/computer/batch.htm#TODAY">TODAY.BAT</A> 
  above.
  <P>You can use ECHO to create a carriage return; i.e. to display a single 
  blank line. The ECHO/ command will provide this carriage return. For example, 
  it is used in line 2 of <A 
  href="http://members.aol.com/rick3in1/computer/batch.htm#TODAY">TODAY.BAT</A> 
  to pipe a carriage return to the DATE command.
  <P>ECHO is used in line 3 of <A 
  href="http://members.aol.com/rick3in1/computer/batch.htm#TODAY">TODAY.BAT</A> 
  in the ECHO [message] mode. However, instead of sending the message to the 
  display screen, it is sent to the file CURRENT.BAT
  <P>ECHO generates output. It is primarily used to pass information to the user 
  by sending a message to the display screen. The output that ECHO generates can 
  be inputted into another command. It also can be used to create a text file by 
  using <A 
  href="http://members.aol.com/rick3in1/computer/batch.htm#04">redirection 
  symbols</A>, as was done in line3 of <A 
  href="http://members.aol.com/rick3in1/computer/batch.htm#TODAY">TODAY.BAT</A>.

  <P><A name=CALL></A><BR>
  <P>Command: CALL<BR>Purpose: Calls one batch file program from within another, 
  executes it, and then returns to the original batch file. The second batch 
  file is called a nested batch file.
  <P>Syntax: CALL [drive][path]batchfile[argument]
  <P>where: Items in brackets [ ] are optional.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  batchfile is the name of batch file you want to call.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  argument is the command the called batchfile will run.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  drive refers to the name of the disk drive where batchfile is 
  located.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; path refers to the subdirectory where 
  batchfile is located.
  <P>Example: Call is used in line 4 of <A 
  href="http://members.aol.com/rick3in1/computer/batch.htm#TODAY">TODAY.BAT</A> 
  to call the batch file D#T.BAT that was created in line 2.
  <P>Comments: One batch file can call another as the last command line of the 
  first batch file without using the CALL command. However, the original file 
  will loose control of the computer to the second file. To get back to the 
  beginning of the original file, the second batch file must call it as its last 
  command. The CALL command gets around this limitation. It allows processing to 
  continue where it left off in the original file.
  <P>Notes: Do not use pipes and redirection symbols with the CALL command. This 
  command requires DOS 3.3 or higher.

  herein, is a batch file enhancement program. I wrote the program, many years 
  ago, using Debug's assembly language. It performs many useful services as 
  determined by the parameters, or switches, used on the DOS command line after 
  the command RIC.
  <P><IMG height=26 alt=free 
  src="How to do Batch File Programming_files/free2.gif" width=37 align=right 
  border=0> The program is available, upon request by E-mail, to readers of this 
  publication. You will still need a text editor to write your batch program. In 
  exchange, please let me know how you located my web site, including the search 
  words and search engine that you used. After working with the program, feed 
  back on any problems you may have encountered may be helpful. In addition I 
  would appreciate knowing from what part of the country, or world, my E-mail is 
  coming from.
  <P>Recently, a visitor to this web page reported that he could not get the 
  switch STRING command to work. Not having programmed for a long time, I 
  started my search for the error with the DOS line command -- DEBUG /? -- to 
  re-learn how to use debug.exe. Next, after navigating to the folder 
  (directory) that contained RIC.COM, I entered the command -- DEBUG RIC.COM S 
  -- and traced through the code. I discovered that, when in the past I had 
  removed the instructions from the earlier version of the COM file to a the 
  text file RIC.TXT, that I also changed the name of the environment variable 
  from STRING to VAR. Further, I noted that I had made the command non case 
  sensitive, the parameter, or switch, s, works just as well as S.
  <P>RIC.COM will request you to read the file RIC.TXT if you fail to use one of 
  the following acceptable command line parameters: 2, 4 or 6 decimal numbers; 
  Bn, C+, C-, D, H, K, M40, M80, S; /HC, /Pn, /P?, /RC, /L, /L0, /Ln, /WN, /WY 
  or /Y.

        user. Prompts the user to make a choice in a batch program. 
Syntax:
    RIC K or Key    ;inserts the value of any alpha key pressed into
		     an environment variable called KEY.
    RIC S or String ;inserts a string of valid characters (alpha,
           numeric, etc.) into an environment variable called VAR.
           MAXIMUM  String size = 118 characters. 
    RIC /Y          ;requests a Yes or No response.
    RIC /WY         ;requests a Yes or No response but defaults to a
		     Yes response after a 5 seconds delay.
    RIC /WN         ;requests a Yes or No response but defaults to a
		     No response after a 5 seconds delay.

</B></PRE>Remarks: When you use RIC K the exiting ERRORLEVEL will be set equal 
  to that of the key pressed, where A to Z, upper or lower case, equals 1 to 26. 
  If the Esc key is pressed, the exiting ERRORLEVEL will be set equal 27.
  <P>Use a temporary batch file (e.g. ##.BAT) to recover the environment 
  variable created by the command RIC K, similar to the following: <PRE><B>	 RIC KEY&gt;##.BAT
	 CALL ##.BAT
	 IF ERRORLEVEL 27 GOTO END
	 GOTO %KEY%

cls
@ECHO OFF
RIC S&gt;##.BAT
CALL ##.BAT
del ##.BAT
IF ERRORLEVEL 27 GOTO END
ECHO You entered %VAR%.
:END
</B></PRE>Use RIC /Y when a Yes or No response is desired. Using RIC /WY or 
  RIC /WN is similar to using RIC /Y, except the program will default with a Y 
  or N response, respectively, if you don't respond with your desired response 
  within 5 seconds. Similar to the DOS CHOICE.COM command, the exiting 
  ERRORLEVEL will be set equal to 1 for a Yes response, and 2 for a No 
  response.<BR><BR><A

  of services.</A> <A name=SCREEN></A><BR><B>SCREEN HANDLING:</B> <PRE><B>Purpose:  Various 
Syntax:
    RIC Bn             ;sets the border color 
    RIC M4 or M40      ;sets video mode to 40 columns
    RIC M8 or M80      ;sets video mode to 80 columns
    RIC ur uc lr lc bc fc    ;creates colored windows

Note: RIC.COM supports text modes only.
</B></PRE>Remarks: When you use RIC Bn to set the border color, n is the hex 
  value of the color from 0 to F, and the exiting ERRORLEVEL will be set equal 
  to that of the color.
  <P>RIC M40 and M80 perform many services. They clear the screen, including its 
  border, on all the pages to the default colors (normally white on black), 
  change the video mode to 40 or 80 columns, restore the normal cursor, home the 
  cursor, exit to page 0, and return an ERRORLEVEL of 1 for M40 and 3 for 
  M80.<BR><PRE><B>
For windowing use  RIC ur uc lr lc bc fc

    ur=upper row, lc=lower column,
    bc/fc=back/foreground colors.

Note: Use only 2, 4 or 6 decimal numbers.

EXAMPLE:     4 20  9 60  1 10
	    ur uc lr lc bc fc 

</B></PRE>For screen blanking, use RIC 1 1 25 80 0 0 (and RIC B0, if needed).
  <P>bc/fc are the decimal values of the back/foreground colors from 0 to 15. 
  Although there are essentially only eight colors (0 to 7), sixteen colors (0 
  to 15) can be specified. Adding 8 to a foreground color yields the intense 
  version of that color. Adding 8 to any background color causes the foreground 
  color to blink.

</B></PRE>Notes: The ERRORLEVEL will be set to the page value. EDIT.COM, and 
  many other programs, support page 0 only.
  <P>Remarks: To effectively use this page-handling service, set up a different

Syntax:
    RIC C+    ;increments COUNT.nnn
    RIC C-    ;decrements COUNT.nnn

</B></PRE>Remarks: COUNT.nnn is a zero byte file. If the file does not already 
  exist, RIC C+ or RIC C- will create COUNT.000 on the default drive. The count 
  is not lost when the computer is shut down. Test the value of the counter 
  COUNT.nnn in a Batch program with a command such as IF EXIST COUNT.006 GOTO 
  SCAN.

Syntax:
    RIC /L0   ;initializes ERRORLEVEL at 0
    RIC /L    ;increments the ERRORLEVEL value
    RIC /Ln   ;checks keyboard buffer for key press; if no key
          was pressed, increments the ERRORLEVEL value, but if a key
          was pressed sets the sum of n plus the value of the key
          press to the ERRORLEVEL.
</B></PRE>Remarks: For looping use RIC /L0 before the loop to initialize 
  ERRORLEVEL at 0, and use RIC /L within the loop to increment the ERRORLEVEL 
  count each cycle. Then, when the desired count is reached the loop can be 
  exited with an IF ERRORLEVEL test within the loop.
  <P>For continuous looping use RIC /Ln (where n is any number 0 to 9 or any 
  letter A to Z) within the loop and reset RIC /L0 each time a desired count is 
  reached. Then, when a number or letter key is pressed the program can exit 
  with another IF ERRORLEVEL test. The exiting ERRORLEVEL will be equal to the 
  sum of n and that of the key pressed, where A to Z equals 1 to 26, 
  respectively.

                     the week called DAY
                    :sets the ERRORLEVEL to 1 to 7, corresponding to
                     day of the week (Sun to Sat)

</B></PRE>You can test for the day of the week in a Batch program with an IF 
  ERRORLEVEL test; or by using a temporary batch file (e.g. ##.BAT) to recover 
  the environment variable created by the command RIC D, similar to the 
  following:<BR><PRE><B>
	 RIC DAY&gt;##.BAT
