<P>Hacking from Win95
<BR>Accessing shares via the Internet
<BR>Alpha Edition:&nbsp; Oct, 1998

<P>[Protecting Yourself]
<BR>[What can they do]
<BR>[Getting set up]
<BR>[Connecting to shares]
<BR>[Final Words]

<P>The purpose of this Guide is to show the reader how to set up
<BR>their Win95 computer to use sharing via the Internet.

<P>Readers are encouraged to explore the information provided here,
<BR>but only after obtaining permission to do so on the remote
<BR>computer.&nbsp; Get with your friends and try these techniques!

<P>The information in this Guide is meant for use by Win95 users,
<BR>as the steps that are outlined are specifically for Win95.&nbsp; This
<BR>same subject for NT has been dealt with in a previous Guide.

<P>Before we start, I should point out that I made extensive use of
<BR>a free source of information...the Microsoft KnowledgeBase.&nbsp; I
<BR>searched for a lot of information, and found a lot of good
<BR>references, by going to http://support.microsoft.com and
<BR>registering my email address.&nbsp; I will be referencing several
<BR>KnowledgeBase throughout this Guide, and you can easily go to
<BR>the Support site and print out copies of the articles...just
<BR>choose to search for a particular article, rather than by
<BR>keyword.

<P>[Protecting yourself]

<P>First, the method of protecting yourself needs to be made
<BR>perfectly clear.&nbsp; DON'T SHARE!!&nbsp; I can't stress that enough.
<BR>If you are a home user, and you are connecting a Win95 computer
<BR>to the Internet via some dial-up method, DISABLE SHARING!

<P>If you must share, use a strong password...8 characters minimum,
<BR>a mix of upper and lower case letters and numbers, change the
<BR>password every now and again.&nbsp; If you need to transmit the
<BR>password to someone, do so over the phone or by written letter.
<BR>Another method for exchanging the information is to use PGP, or
<BR>'Pretty Good Privacy' (obtaining and installing PGP was covered
<BR>in a previous Guide).&nbsp; Using PGP will not only allow you to
<BR>encrypt the information so that only your friend(s) can
<BR>decrypt it, but you can also digitally sign the file so that
<BR>your friends know that only you could have sent it.

<P>To disable sharing, click on My Computer -> Control Panel ->
<BR>Network -> File and Print Sharing.&nbsp; In the dialogue box that
<BR>appears, uncheck both boxes.&nbsp; It's that easy.&nbsp; If you are
using
<BR>NT, disable the Server service to disable sharing...click on
<BR>My Computer -> Control Panel -> Services, and disable the
<BR>Server service.

<P>[What can they do]

<P>If someone can access you hard drive via the Internet, there are
<BR>many things they can do...it all depends upon their knowledge and
<BR>their intent.&nbsp; Given correct access permissions, they could
<BR>erase your hard drive...or leave a 'hidden bomb' behind so that
<BR>your hard drive is erased the next time you boot up.&nbsp; Or they
<BR>could simply modify your system.ini file so that the next time
<BR>your computer boots up, it opens into the old Program Manager
<BR>shell from Windows 3.1, instead of the nice friendly Explorer
<BR>shell that you are used to.&nbsp; Or they could just copy your
<BR>email mailboxes, some data, and be merrily on their way.

<P>Of course, there are all sorts of pathological uses for DOS
<BR>commands like deltree and ctty, and toys like BO...

<P>[Getting set up]

<P>First of all, you need to make sure that your system is set up
<BR>correctly to access another win95 machine via the Internet.&nbsp; The
<BR>assumptions made in the following steps are that:

<P>(a) you have your win95 disks or CD, and
<BR>(b) you have a modem in your computer.

<P>By assuming that the reader has a modem, we can keep the
<BR>Guide simple, but users who are on a LAN should have no trouble
<BR>following the Guide.

<P>1.&nbsp; The first thing you need to do is make sure that you have
<BR>the latest version of DUN (Dial-Up Networking) for Win95.&nbsp; The
<BR>current version is DUN v1.3, and can be obtained by going to:

<P>http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload

<P>Choose "Windows95 Shareware and Utilities" from the "Support
<BR>Drivers, Patches and Service Packs" section, and then choose
<BR>the update from the "Networking &amp; Communications" section.

<P>NOTE:&nbsp; Feel free to gather any other updates that you may be
<BR>interested in, such as TweakUI.&nbsp; Another useful tool that you
<BR>will find here under "Resource Kits" is the Windows95 Resource
<BR>Kit Help File and Utilities.

<P>Once you have obtained and installed the DUN update, you should
<BR>be ready to begin.

<P>************************************************************
<BR>NEWBIE NOTE:&nbsp; Before you go on, you might want to look at
<BR>or print out the following Microsoft KnowledgeBase articles:

<P>Q178729:&nbsp; How to configure Win95 to dial into a RAS/RRAS
<BR>server
<BR>http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q178/7/29.asp

<P>Q145843:&nbsp; How to connect to a remote server
<BR>http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q145/8/43.asp

<P>Q183368:&nbsp; Requirements to browse network with dial-up
<BR>networking
<BR>http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q183/3/68.asp
<BR>************************************************************

<P>Let's get started...

<P>2.&nbsp; Click on Control Panel -> Network, and open the applet
<BR>to the Configuration tab.&nbsp; You should see the following entries
<BR>at a minimum:&nbsp; Client for Microsoft Networks, DialUp Adapter,
<BR>and TCP/IP.

<P>If one or more of these entries aren't there, choose Add, and
<BR>select the appropriate choice.&nbsp; Make sure that you have your
<BR>disks or CD-ROM available...just in case.

<P>**If you don't already have it, add NetBEUI to your system by
<BR>choosing Control Panel -> Network -> Add, and choose Protocol.
<BR>Select the NetBEUI protocol and install it.

<P>3.&nbsp; Select TCP/IP, and open the Properties for it.&nbsp; In the
IP
<BR>Address tab, you will most likely have the 'Obtain an IP address
<BR>automatically' choice selected.

<P>4.&nbsp; Now double click on My Computer, choose DialUp Networking,
<BR>and&nbsp; double click on icon for the connection to your ISP.&nbsp;
Under
<BR>the Server Type tab, you should have the following selections:

<P>Type of Dial-Up Server:&nbsp; PPP: Windows 95, Windows NT 3.5, Internet

<P>Advanced Options:&nbsp; 'Log on to network' and 'Enable software
<BR>compression'

<P>Allowed network protocols:&nbsp; TCP/IP

<P>5.&nbsp; Now, click the 'TCP/IP Settings...' button, and you should
see
<BR>the 'Server assigned IP address' and 'Server assigned name server
<BR>addresses' radio buttons selected.&nbsp; Both 'Use IP header
<BR>compression' and 'Use default gateway on remote network' should
<BR>be checked.

<P>[Connecting to shares]

<P>6.&nbsp; Before connecting to shares via the Internet, you need to
<BR>make sure that you machine is configured to use the 'lmhosts'
<BR>file on your computer to resolve NetBIOS names to IP addresses.
<BR>To do this, click Start -> Settings -> Control Panel ->
<BR>Network.

<P>On the Configuration tab, click 'TCP/IP', and click 'Properties'.

<P>On the WINS Configuration tab, click 'Disable WINS Resolution'.

<P>Click Ok, then Ok, again.

<P>Reboot your machine.

<P>7.&nbsp; Now we need to configure lmhosts file entries.&nbsp; You might
<BR>want to start by opening the lmhosts.sam file:

<P>***********************************************************
<BR>NEWBIE NOTE:&nbsp; The lmhosts file is similar to the hosts file
<BR>in that it is used to resolve names to IP addresses.&nbsp; WINS
<BR>and lmhosts files are the Microsoft versions of the DNS and
<BR>hosts files systems.&nbsp; DNS/hosts files are used to resolve
<BR>Internet names like "www.example.com" to IP addresses.
<BR>WINS/lmhosts files are used to resolve NetBIOS names of
<BR>machines to their IP addresses.
<BR>***********************************************************

<P>c:\windows\lmhosts.sam

<P>..in Notepad and reading through it.&nbsp; Then from the command
<BR>prompt, type:

<P>c:\windows>edit lmhosts

<P>or

<P>c:\windows>notepad lmhosts

<P>The entries in the file should look like:

<P>[IP address] [NetBIOS name]&nbsp; #PRE

<P>Each entry in the lmhosts file needs to look like this
<BR>if you are going to access shares on the machines.

<P>***********************************************************
<BR>NEWBIE NOTE:&nbsp; If you don't have the NetBIOS name of your
<BR>friend's computer, you can get it using the nbtstat command.
<BR>You have to have the IP address...type:

<P>c:\>nbtstat -A [ip_addr]
<BR>**NOTE:&nbsp; The letter "A" MUST be capitalized!

<P>You should see something similar to:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NetBIOS Remote Machine Name Table
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Status

<P>---------------------------------------------

<P>Registered Registered Registered Registered Registered

<P>MAC Address = 00-00-00-00-00-00
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>95_Box&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;00>&nbsp; UNIQUE
<BR>95_Box&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;20>&nbsp; UNIQUE
<BR>domain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;00>&nbsp; GROUP
<BR>domain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;1C>&nbsp; GROUP
<BR>domain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;1E>&nbsp; GROUP
<BR>95_Box&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;03>&nbsp; UNIQUE

<P>What you are looking for is the line with "&lt;00>
<BR>UNIQUE"...the name at the beginning of the line is
<BR>the NetBIOS name of the computer.&nbsp; This is what gets
<BR>entered in the lmhosts file.

<P>If you get the error message "Host not found", it may
<BR>mean one of several things...your friend is not logged
<BR>on, there is a firewall between the two of you, etc.
<BR>***********************************************************

<P>8.&nbsp; Now we need to refresh the NetBIOS cache for your
<BR>machine...

<P>In the DOS command window, type:

<P>c:\>nbtstat -R

<P>This command reloads the cache from the lmhosts file you just
<BR>created.

<P>Now, click on Start -> Find -> Computer, and type in the NetBIOS
<BR>name of the computer...the same one you added to the lmhosts file.
<BR>If your attempt to connect to the machine is successful, you should
<BR>be presented with a window containing an icon representing your
<BR>friend's machine.

<P>You may be presented with a password prompt window; your friend
<BR>should have given you the password, but if he didn't just try
<BR>guessing it.

<P>[Final words]

<P>Please remember that this file is for instructional purposes only
<BR>and is meant to educate the sysadmin and user alike.&nbsp; Accessing
<BR>computers via the Internet that you do not have permission to access
<BR>is a violation of federal law in the US.&nbsp; It is best to use the
<BR>information in this Guide and others to pursue the one and only
<BR>guaranteed method of gaining root on a system...become the sysadmin!!
