<P>Introduction to Computer Viruses
<BR>____________________________________________________________

<P>&nbsp;It's Saturday morning.&nbsp; You boot up your Windows 98 computer
and lo and
<BR>behold, the graphics on the desktop are a mirror image of what they
should
<BR>be.&nbsp; Congratulations, you have a computer virus!
<BR>&nbsp;According to "Virus Bulletin," the Oxfordshire, England-based
technical
<BR>journal that tracks viruses, this new virus flips any uncompressed
bitmaps
<BR>horizontally, but only on Saturdays.&nbsp; This bulletin credits GriYo
of the 29A
<BR>virus-writing group as the author of this 32-bit polymorphic Windows
virus
<BR>now known as HPS (Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome).
<BR>&nbsp;Panda Software of Spain has announced that it has the antidote
to HPS.
<BR>Meanwhile, other antivirus companies scramble to code a cure for this
<BR>Windows 98 desktop graphics virus.
<BR>&nbsp;So far HPS appears, like many viruses, to be harmless and humorous.
<BR>According to the book "Computer Viruses" by Robert Slade (Springer,
1996),
<BR>"The truth is that relatively few viral programs perform any overt
damage to
<BR>a system." However, no matter how harmless any virus may appear to
be,
<BR>people worry that it might do something else, perhaps on some Friday
the
<BR>13th or maybe, who knows Jan. 1, the year 2000.&nbsp; Even if GriYo
had the best
<BR>of intentions, people worry that a mistake buried somewhere in his
HPS code
<BR>might accidentally cause harm.
<BR>&nbsp;Let's face it.&nbsp; Turn a computer virus loose and you can
become mighty
<BR>unpopular -- regardless of how harmless, funny, or even beneficial
you
<BR>believe your virus might be. People don't like to have programs running
on
<BR>their computers unless they make the decision to put them there.

<P>****************************************************************
<BR>In this Guide you will learn:

<P>Part One:
<BR>* What is a computer virus?
<BR>* Types of computer viruses
<BR>* Why study and create viruses?
<BR>* How to catch them
<BR>* How to fight them
<BR>****************************************************************

<P>&nbsp;One of the nice things about the recent escalation in computer
crime is
<BR>that the media doesn't make such a big fuss over viruses any more.&nbsp;
Sure,
<BR>they (viruses and the media both) can be a pain.&nbsp; However, with
all those
<BR>antivirus programs we can call upon for help, and with almost everyone
now
<BR>understanding the importance of frequent backups, viruses are no big
deal,
<BR>right?

<P>&nbsp;"Computer viruses are no big deal." Famous last words?&nbsp; Digital
viruses may
<BR>be the first stages of artificial life.&nbsp; Think about it -- are
we ready yet
<BR>to share the planet with artificial life?&nbsp; Will we find some means
of
<BR>friendly coexistence, just as we have learned to safely enjoy cheetahs,
<BR>lions and wolves?&nbsp; Will viruses perhaps even evolve into helpful
life forms
<BR>that will end poverty and war, help us understand the meaning of life
itself
<BR>and even shed light on the nature of God?&nbsp; Or will some computer
virus
<BR>designer create code that evolves into something that destroys the
human
<BR>race? Or ... maybe you readers will get fed up with me hyping viruses
and
<BR>flame war me into hiding!

<P>What is a Computer Virus?

<P>&nbsp;In 1988 the Internet was shut down by the "Morris Worm," a self-replicating
<BR>program coded by Robert Tappan Morris of the Chaos Computer Club.&nbsp;
It used
<BR>sendmail and finger exploits to break into and propagate from one Unix
<BR>computer to another.&nbsp; By the time it had infected some 10% of
the computers
<BR>on the Internet, it was clogging essential Internet communications
lines as
<BR>the worm shipped around ever more copies of itself.
<BR>&nbsp;Yet many computer scientists say we shouldn't call the Morris
Worm a
<BR>computer virus.
<BR>&nbsp;Before the first computer virus was ever coded, in 1984, Dr.
Fred Cohen
<BR>wrote his doctoral thesis on the topic (published in his book "Computer
<BR>Viruses," ASP Press, 1986).&nbsp; As a result, Cohen is credited by
many with
<BR>being the first to conceive of their existence.&nbsp; It is important
to remember
<BR>-- Cohen is AGAINST computer viruses. He didn't invent them, but was
the
<BR>first to prove they could be created, and to foresee the damage they
could
<BR>cause.&nbsp; Purists hold by the definition of virus that appeared
in Cohen's
<BR>doctoral thesis: a computer virus is code that, when active, attaches
itself
<BR>to other programs.
<BR>&nbsp;However, long before Dr. Cohen detailed the characteristics of
viruses,
<BR>mathematician John von Neumann proved that a Turing machine (a mathematical
<BR>construct representing a single-processor computer) is capable of containing
<BR>a "universal constructor" which, if provided with a program containing
its
<BR>own description, is able to reproduce itself.&nbsp; Von Neumann's "universal
<BR>constructor" proof covers not only Cohen's definition of a computer
virus,
<BR>but also self-replicating programs such as the Morris Worm.
<BR>&nbsp;Are these definitions making you dizzy?&nbsp; Me, too. So I decided
in this
<BR>Guide to use the definition proposed by virus researcher Dr. Mark Ludwig.
<BR>He defines a computer virus as "a program that reproduces.&nbsp; When
executed,
<BR>it simply makes more copies of itself.&nbsp; Those copies may later
be executed
<BR>to create still more copies, ad infinitum."&nbsp; This definition is
broad enough
<BR>to include the Morris Worm.

<P>********************************************************************
<BR>Newbie note:&nbsp; To "execute" a program means to make it run.&nbsp;
As long as a
<BR>program is merely a file, it is doing nothing.&nbsp; However, when
something is
<BR>done to feed the information of a file into the central processing
unit of a
<BR>computer in such a way as to command it to do something, we say the
program
<BR>has been "executed."
<BR>********************************************************************

<P>&nbsp;Each virus program must consist of at least two parts.&nbsp; It
must contain a
<BR>search routine which helps it find new files, disks or host computers
on
<BR>which to replicate.&nbsp; It also must have a routine that copies itself
to these
<BR>new computers that its search routine discovers.
<BR>&nbsp;Many viruses also contain self-defense features that allow them
to hide
<BR>from or even fight back against anti-virus programs.
<BR>&nbsp;Some also, like HPS, contain a harmless message or prank.&nbsp;
The Stoned virus
<BR>carries the message "Your computer is now stoned" along with an occasional
<BR>plea to legalize marijuana.
<BR>&nbsp;Unfortunately, a few viruses do something harmful.&nbsp; Often
the harm is
<BR>accidental, as few virus coders wish to harm anyone.&nbsp; Robert Tappan
Morris
<BR>had no intention of crashing the Internet with his Worm.&nbsp; Each
individual
<BR>worm was harmless. The trouble came because they multiplied far faster
than
<BR>he had expected.
<BR>&nbsp;Also, there are a few -- very few -- people who willfully misuse
their
<BR>programming talents to unleash destructive viruses on the world.

<P>Types of Viruses

<P>&nbsp;There are several major types of viruses.
<BR>* Boot sector infectors, which can live even on a blank DOS/Windows
disk by
<BR>taking advantage of the little-known program which tells your computer
how
<BR>to read the disk.
<BR>* Program file infectors (this includes MS Word document macro viruses)
<BR>* Worms (such as the Morris Worm) which use other programs to replicate
but
<BR>do not attach themselves to programs.
<BR>&nbsp;Currently the most common type of virus is the macro virus.&nbsp;
A recent
<BR>example of a macro virus is WM/PolyPoster.&nbsp; This virus will wait
until you
<BR>go online and post your infected document(s) to alt.sex.stories and
other
<BR>popular Usenet news groups under the title "Important Monica Lewinsky
Info".

<P>Why Study -- and Create -- Viruses?

<P>&nbsp;"The Giant Black Book of Computer Viruses" by Ludwig (American
Eagle Press,
<BR>1995) argues "Should we not be a Socrates, who ... sought Truth and
Wisdom
<BR>... the question that really matters is not how computers can make
us
<BR>wealthy or give us power over others, but how they might make us wise.&nbsp;
What
<BR>can we learn about ourselves? about our world? and yes, maybe even
about
<BR>God?&nbsp; Might we not understand life a little better if we can create
<BR>something similar, and study it, and try to understand it?"
<BR>&nbsp;Some researchers seek to figure out new ways to defeat antivirus
programs
<BR>because they believe it is the best way to design them to stay one
jump
<BR>ahead of the tiny minority of virus writers who release damaging code.&nbsp;
Do
<BR>you really want to rely on a commercial antivirus program to be your
only
<BR>defense?&nbsp; Yes, these programs can be really helpful.&nbsp; However,
if you are a
<BR>serious hacker who downloads and tests lots of Windows programs (almost
all
<BR>viruses attack Windows), you had better be prepared to fight viruses
that
<BR>the antivirus companies have never even heard of.
<BR>&nbsp;Other people research viruses because they could become potent
weapons in
<BR>time of war.&nbsp; The story of a computer virus being unleashed against
Iraq
<BR>during the Desert Storm War is a April Fool's Day hoax that got out
of hand.
<BR>But the day is coming when they will be used in wartime.
<BR>&nbsp;If you live in a country where the government is run by a dictatorship
or
<BR>is occupied by an invader's troops, viruses may be the guerrilla warrior's
<BR>best friend.
<BR>&nbsp;Some virus designers want to create artificial life forms that
will, for
<BR>good or evil, revolutionize history.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>How to Catch Them

<P>&nbsp;Have you ever gotten an email from a friend that reads something
like this?

<P>Internet Virus&nbsp; !!!!Warning!!!!
<BR>Hello;
<BR>Please Broadcast this message.

<P>Mails CCMAIL or E-MAIL name's JOINT THE CREW &amp; PENPALS GREETINGS
<BR>should destroy all datas on your hard disk when you open them.
<BR>These virus call CHEVAL TROYEN make infection on boot sector.
<BR>These can be autoduplicator.

<P>You should destroy them, DO NOT OPEN THEM.....

<P>&nbsp;After a week or so you are probably are getting the same message
again and
<BR>again, each time slightly mutated:

<P>VIRUS&nbsp; WARNING !!!!!!
<BR>If you receive an email titled "JOIN THE CREW" DO NOT open it.&nbsp;
It
<BR>will erase everything on your hard drive.

<P>Forward this letter out to as many people as you can. This is a new,
very
<BR>malicious virus and not many people know about it. This
<BR>information was announced yesterday morning from IBM; please share
it with
<BR>everyone that might access the internet...

<P>&nbsp;This "join the crew" virus warning is yet another example of the
kind of
<BR>message that first warned of an email virus entitled "Good Times."&nbsp;
In
<BR>1994-5 that first emailed virus warning flashed across the Internet
with
<BR>amazing speed and persistence.&nbsp; Soon people were getting Good
Times warnings
<BR>every day.&nbsp; Even reputable sysadmins broadcast the warning to
all their users.
<BR>&nbsp;Good Times was a hoax. It is impossible to catch a virus from
merely
<BR>reading email.&nbsp; You must run a program to catch a virus.
<BR>&nbsp;True, there are macro viruses such as those that infest Microsoft
Word (MS
<BR>Word) documents.&nbsp; They replicate when you merely read a file in
MS Word.
<BR>However, macros are programs which are executed when you read a text
file --
<BR>but only when you read it in MS Word.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this "feature"
of MS
<BR>Word has the consequence that macro viruses are now the most common
of viruses.
<BR>&nbsp;However, email is structured so that macros cannot, absolutely
cannot, be
<BR>embedded in it.&nbsp; If someone wants to email a macro to you, it
will always be
<BR>in a file attached to email.&nbsp; As long as you refuse to load email
<BR>attachments into programs that run macros such as MS Word, you are
safe.
<BR>&nbsp;Some people have argued that phony email virus warnings are in
themselves
<BR>computer viruses.&nbsp; They have a search routine -- the plea to email
them to
<BR>everyone you know.&nbsp; Their copy mechanism is you -- if you are
dumb enough to
<BR>command your email program to send these warnings on to other people.
<BR>&nbsp;So how does a computer get infected by a computer virus?&nbsp;
You must always
<BR>run a vulnerable program in association with the virus code in order
to
<BR>catch one.&nbsp; In the case of the Morris Worm, all you needed to
do was hook up
<BR>your computer as an Internet host.&nbsp; The sendmail and finger daemons,
which
<BR>run quietly in the background all the time, were the active programs
that
<BR>spread the Worm.&nbsp; In the case of MS Word macros, the act of reading
an MS
<BR>Word text file activates a macro which replicates the virus.&nbsp;
In the case of
<BR>a boot sector virus, simply putting a floppy disk into a drive and
giving a
<BR>command to see what is on the disk propagates the virus.

<P>How to Fight Them

<P>&nbsp;Maybe you are one of those people who greet each new uninvited
program with
<BR>the shout "Get that !@#$@#$% virus OUT of my COMPUTER!"&nbsp; If so,
what is the
<BR>best way to avoid infection?&nbsp; Once infected, how do you get that
!@#$@#$%
<BR>virus OUT?
<BR>&nbsp;There are a number of commercial antivirus programs that automatically
scan
<BR>for viruses very day at a certain time, as well as every time you start
your
<BR>computer.&nbsp; They also scan every floppy disk for boot sector viruses
every
<BR>time you load one in a disk drive and try to read it.&nbsp; I use Norton
<BR>Antivirus with good results; many others say McAffee works well.&nbsp;
Dr. Ludwig
<BR>reports that all commercial antivirus software works about equally
poorly.
<BR>Of course, he's always testing them against the most amazing, exotic,
tricky
<BR>viruses in the world, half of which he has written himself.&nbsp; So
it's
<BR>understandable that he's not impressed.
<BR>&nbsp;I learned the hard way that a really bad way to get antivirus
software was
<BR>from a floppy given to me by a friend.&nbsp; I tried that once and
caught a new
<BR>virus from his floppy instead of getting rid of an old one!&nbsp; That
disk was
<BR>infected with a boot sector infector.&nbsp;&nbsp; So before I could
even run it on my
<BR>friend's program, the instant my computer tried to read the directory
on the
<BR>disk, it got infected.&nbsp; This new virus had the cute side effect
of disabling
<BR>the antivirus program.
<BR>&nbsp;Because of this problem, commercial antivirus software comes
complete with
<BR>instructions on how to bootstrap your computer back to health.&nbsp;
If you don't
<BR>follow those instructions exactly, you may end up like me, giving your
<BR>computer a virus instead of eradicating one.
<BR>&nbsp;Since, according to Ludwig, there are many viruses out there
for which
<BR>there are no antivirus programs, this should motivate us to try to
avoid
<BR>catching them in the first place.&nbsp; What are some precautions even
those of
<BR>us who run commercial antivirus programs should take?&nbsp; Here are
my top
<BR>recommendations.

<P>1) Use the Unix operating system. There are few Unix viruses or worms.&nbsp;
I
<BR>like to think that is because it is a superior operating systems.&nbsp;
However,
<BR>it may also be largely because Windows computers are common and cheap
and
<BR>the kind of people who code malicious viruses are so lame that they
can't
<BR>figure out how to code for Unix systems.&nbsp; However, be warned --
the second
<BR>part of this Guide includes the source code for a Unix virus!

<P>2) See that kewl warez d00dz site? Wouldn't it be nice to get thousands
of
<BR>dollars worth of commercial software from them for free?&nbsp; Watch
out!&nbsp; The
<BR>kind of guys who pirate software might also be the kind of guys who
get a
<BR>chuckle out of reformatting your hard drive by giving you viruses hidden
in
<BR>their archives.&nbsp; Also, some people fight warez sites by secretly
<BR>booby-trapping them with viruses.

<P>3) See that lovely haxor dOOdz site full animated flames, spinning skulls
<BR>and creepy organ music?&nbsp; See all those programs on that site that
promise to
<BR>empower you to mail bomb people, crash their computers and break into
the
<BR>Pentagon?&nbsp; Now, is it just possible that the kind of people who
want to help
<BR>other people raise heck -- gosh -- could they also be the kind of people
who
<BR>would slip a virus or two into those programs you download?

<P>4) See that email with an attached file?&nbsp; The sender says it is
a really
<BR>kewl program.&nbsp; A new game, better than Quake or Barbie Fashion
Designer.
<BR>Wait, why is a stranger sending you a free game program?&nbsp; Maybe
he's up to
<BR>no good.&nbsp; Or -- maybe it is an attached file sent to you by a
friend.&nbsp; Wait!
<BR>How do you know that email is really from your friend?&nbsp; Does it
have his or
<BR>her PGP signature?&nbsp; Have you phoned your friend to ask whether
he or she
<BR>really sent you that program?&nbsp; Don't run a new program unless
you are
<BR>certain it comes from a trustworthy source.

<P>5) Upgrade Microsoft Office (or Microsoft Word) to Office 97 (Word 97).
<BR>This disables all the old macro viruses.&nbsp; It also checks for macros
in any
<BR>new file you open.&nbsp; If it finds them, it prompts you to decide
whether you
<BR>want to disable these macros.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it is even easier
to write
<BR>macro viruses for Office 97, which uses Visual basic for its macro
language.
<BR>So if you want to be really safe, simply refuse to let any macros whatsoever
<BR>run on this office suite.&nbsp; Better yet, use some other office suite
such as
<BR>Corel.&nbsp; Only Microsoft programs are vulnerable to macro viruses.

<P>6) Disable Java on your Web browser.&nbsp; Haven't heard about Java
viruses yet?
<BR>In part two of this Guide you will get source code for a Java virus
that
<BR>infects Unix computers that run the Bourne shell.&nbsp; Java can also
transmit
<BR>viruses that will infect Windows computers.

<P>7) Do or don't do all the other stuff I forgot to put in this list.&nbsp;
What
<BR>this really means is, don't trust me or anyone to be the last word
on
<BR>viruses.&nbsp; Good books to study which include source code to viruses
are "It's
<BR>Alive" by Dr. Fred Cohen, (Wiley, New York, 1994) and "The Giant Black
Book
<BR>of Computer Viruses" by Dr. Mark Ludwig (American Eagle, Show Low AZ,
1998).
