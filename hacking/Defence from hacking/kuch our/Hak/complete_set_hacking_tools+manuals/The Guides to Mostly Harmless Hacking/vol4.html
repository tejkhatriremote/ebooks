<P>Vol. 4: Information Warfare Series



<BR>No. 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="Hacker Wars: Fighting the Cybernazis"></A>Hacker



Wars: Fighting the Cybernazis



<BR>__________________________________________________________







<P>&nbsp;There is a war underway in cyberspace. It is a war between the



forces of repression and those of us who treasure freedom. On the side



of repression are governments who fear the untrammeled freedom of speech



that is today's Internet -- and several bands of computer criminals who



have the nerve to call themselves hackers.







<P>&nbsp;I prefer to call them cybernazis. They are the spiritual descendants



of the Nazis of the Germany of the 1930s, who burned books in their campaign



to keep the German people ignorant.







<P>&nbsp;The tactics of today’s cybernazis are to shut down people’s email



accounts, deface Web pages, and to use terror tactics to get people kicked



of their Internet service providers. In some cases cybernazis also target



their victims with massive credit card fraud, death threats, and worse.







<P>&nbsp;So far, the cybernazis have been far more successful than governments



in shutting down Web sites with which they disagree, blocking email, and



getting people whose ideas they dislike kicked off Internet service providers.







<P>&nbsp;It’s a war that has targeted this Happy Hacker email list ever



since we started it in August 1996. The cybernazis have felt we merit a



wide range of attacks, not only digital but including blackmail and threats



against those who have been courageous enough to be part of Happy Hacker.







<P>**********************************************************



<BR>In this Guide, the first of the Information Warfare Volume, you will



learn:



<BR>&middot; what are hacker wars



<BR>&middot; Web page hacking



<BR>&middot; denial of service



<BR>&middot; sniffing



<BR>&middot; social engineering



<BR>&middot; ISP hostage taking



<BR>&middot; the damage hacker warriors may do to bystanders



<BR>&middot; why you may get hit someday



<BR>&middot; how to get into a hacker war (some people want to!)



<BR>&middot; how to keep from getting caught -- NOT!



<BR>&middot; defense techniques that don’t break the law



<BR>**********************************************************







<P>&nbsp;The most serious battle in these wars took place Oct. 4-21, 1997.



It targeted Bronc Buster. During the course of this battle, jericho and



Modify sent me many email messages that made it clear that Bronc was being



hit because of his high quality Web site (hope you can find it still up



at http://showdown.org) and his association with Happy Hacker.







<P>&nbsp;This war escalated beyond an initial spate of forgeries beginning



Oct. 4, 1997 that attempted to make it look like Bronc was a self-confessed



pedophile, into scorched-core warfare that shut down the Succeed.net ISP



repeatedly. They attacked Succeed.net because it was providing Bronc with



a shell account.







<P>&nbsp;I helped muster both the FBI and volunteer technical help from



an Internet backbone provider to aid Succeed.net in its struggle against



these vindictive computer criminals. If you, too, get hit by the cybernazis,



too, tell me about it. I will be delighted to help you fight them.







<P>************************************************************



<BR>I don't want to get sued disclaimer: Just because jericho and Modify



acted as spokesmen for the attackers, and in the case of jericho claimed



considerable knowledge of technical details of the attacks, does not mean



they are guilty of anything. Nosirree. I am not saying they did it.



<BR>************************************************************







<P>&nbsp;So, do you want to join us in our battle against those cybernazis,



against those who are trying to wipe out freedom on the Internet? Want



to enlist in the good guy side of information warfare? One way is to learn



and practice defensive skills against hacker war criminals.







<P>&nbsp;In this GTMHH No.1 of the Information Warfare Volume we will cover



hacker war only. But an understanding of hacker war will prepare you for



No. 2, which will help you protect yourself from far broader attacks which



can even lead to your ‘digital death,” and No. 3, which will lay the foundation



for becoming an international information warfare fighter.







<P>What Exactly Are Hacker Wars?







<P>&nbsp;Hacker wars are attempts to damage people or organizations using



cyberspace. There are several types of hacker war tactics. In this Guide



we will discuss some of the more common attacks.







<P>Web Page Hacking







<P>&nbsp;Lots of people ask me, “How do I hack a Web page?” Alas, gentle



reader, the first step in this process ought to be physiologically impossible



and unsuitable for description in a family publication.







<P>&nbsp;The typical Web page hack begins with getting write permission



to the hypertext files on the Web server that has been targeted. Amazingly,



some Web sites accidentally offer write permission to anyone (world writable)!



If so, all the hacker warrior need do is create a bogus Web page, give



it the same name as the desired page on the Web site to be hit, and then



transfer it via ftp.







<P>&nbsp;Otherwise it is usually necessary to first break into the Web



server computer and gain root or administrative control.







<P>&nbsp;Hacked web pages usually consist of dirty pictures and bad language.



I have hunted down many hacked Web sites. Wise political analysis, witty



repartee and trenchant satire have been absent from every one I have ever



seen -- with the single exception of one hack in Indonesia by the East



Timor freedom fighter group. Perhaps because they risked their lives to



have their say, they made their hack count.







<P>&nbsp;But maybe my standards are too high. Judge for yourself. Parental



discretion and antinausea medicine advised. Collections of hacked Web pages



may be found at



<BR>http://www.skeeve.net/



<BR>http://www.2600.com/hacked_pages







<P>&nbsp;However, even if someone’s cause is good and their commentary



trenchant, messing up Web sites is a pitiful way to get across a message.



They are quickly fixed. One has to hack a really famous Web site to make



it into an archive.







<P>&nbsp;If you believe in freedom enough to respect the integrity of other



people's Web sites, and are serious about making a political statement



on the Web, the legal and effective way is to get a domain name that is



so similar to the site you oppose that lots of people will go there by



accident. For example, http://clinton96.org was hilarious, clean, effective,



and legal. http://dole96.org was also taken by parody makers. They are



both down now. But they were widely reported. Many political sites linked



to them!







<P>&nbsp;To get your web spoof domain name, go to http://internic.net.



You will save a lot of money by purchasing it directly from them instead



of through an intermediary. In fact, all you need to do is promise to buy



a domain name. If you get tired of your parody Web site before you pay



for it, people have told me they have just given the name back to Internic



and no one demanded payment.







<P>***********************************************************



<BR>You can get punched in the nose by a giant corporation warning: If



you get a parody domain name so you can put up a Web site that makes fun



of a big corporation, even though you are not breaking the law, you may



get sued. Even if you win the lawsuit, you could spend a lot of money in



self defense. But you may be able to get lots of good publicity by alerting



reporters to your plight before taking down your Web site. So in the end,



especially if you get sued, you may make your views known to even more



people than if you had hacked their Web site.



<BR>***********************************************************







<P>&nbsp;If you want to keep your Web site from being attacked, I recommend



using a company that does nothing but host Web pages. This makes it easier



to avoid being hacked. This is because the more services an Internet service



provider offers, the more vulnerabilities it exposes. For example, my http://techbroker.com



is hosted by a Silicon Graphics box that does nothing but run a Web server.



My @techbroker.com email, by contrast, is hosted on a machine that does



nothing but host a POP (post office protocol) server. For sending out email,



I use yet another computer.







<P>DOS Attacks







<P>&nbsp;A second type of hacker war is denial of service (DOS)attacks.



Because they harm many people other than the direct targets, DOS may well



be the most serious type of hacker war.







<P>&nbsp;Spammers are a favorite target of DOS warriors. Spammers also,



if my sources are telling the truth, fight back. The weapon of choice on



both sides is the mail bomb.







<P>&nbsp;Recently (June-Oct. 1997), hackers fought a massive war against



spammer kingdom Cyber Promotions, Inc. with the AGIS Internet backbone



provider caught in the middle. Cyberpromo went to court to force AGIS to



give it Internet access (AGIS eventually won and kicked off Cyberpromo).



But in the meantime it was seriously hurt by a barrage of computer vandalism.







<P>&nbsp;While the vandals who attacked AGIS probably think they have a



good cause, they have been doing more damage than any hacker war in history,



and harming a lot of innocent people and companies in the process.







<P>&nbsp;According one source on the AGIS attacks, “The person who really



did it 'owned' all of their machines, their routers, and everything else



inbetween (sic).” So, although the attacks on AGIS apparently consisted



of computer break-ins, the use of the break-ins was to deny service to



users of AGIS.







<P>********************************************************



<BR>Newbie note: An Internet backbone is a super high capacity communications



network. It may include fiber optics and satellites and new protocols such



as Asynchronous Transfer Mode. An outage in a backbone provider may affect



millions of Internet users.



<BR>********************************************************



<BR>********************************************************



<BR>You can go to jail warning: Attacking an Internet backbone provider



is an especially easy way to get a long, long stay in prison.



<BR>********************************************************







<P>&nbsp;Other DOS attacks include the ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)



attacks so familiar to IRC warriors; and an amazing range of attacks on



Windows NT systems. http://www.dhp.com/~fyodor/ has a good list of these



NT DOS vulnerabilities, while Bronc Buster’s http://showdown.org is great



for Unix DOS attacks. Please note: we are pointing these out so you can



study them or test your own computer or computers that you have permission



to test.







<P>While Windows NT is in general harder for criminals to break into, it



is generally much easier to carry out DOS attacks against them.







<P>********************************************************



<BR>You can go to jail, get fired and/or get punched in the nose warning:



DOS attacks in general are pathetically easy to launch but in some cases



hard to defend against. So not only can one get into all sorts of trouble



for DOS attacks -- people will also laugh at those who get caught at it.



“Code kiddie! Lamer!”



<BR>********************************************************







<P>Sniffing







<P>&nbsp;Sniffing is observing the activity of one’s victim on a network



(usually the Internet). This can include grabbing passwords, reading email,



and observing telnet sessions.







<P>&nbsp;Sniffer programs can only be installed if one is root on that



computer. But it isn’t enough to make sure that your Internet host computers



are free of sniffers. Your email, telnet, ftp, Web surfing -- and any passwords



you may use -- may go through 20 or more computers on their way to a final



destination. That’s a lot of places where a sniffer might be installed.



If you really, seriously don’t want some cybernazi watching everything



you do online, there are several solutions.







<P>&nbsp;The Eudora Pro program will allow you to use the APOP protocol



to protect your password when you download email. However, this will not



protect the email itself from snoopers.







<P>&nbsp;If you have a shell account, Secure Shell (ssh) from Datafellows



will encrypt everything that passes between your home and shell account



computers. You can also set up an encrypted tunnel from one computer on



which you have a shell account to a second shell account on another computer



-- if both are running Secure Shell.







<P>&nbsp;You may download a free ssh server program for Unix at ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/packages/security/ssh/ssh-1.2.20.tar.gz,



or check out http://www.cs.hut.fi/ssh/#ftp-sites.







<P>&nbsp;If you are a sysadmin or owner of an ISP, get ssh now! Within



a few years, all ISPs that have a clue will require ssh logins to shell



accounts.







<P>&nbsp;For a client version that will run on your Windows, Mac or any



version of Unix computer, see the DataFellows site at http://www.datafellows.com/.



But remember, your shell account must be running the ssh server program



in order for your Windows ssh client to work.







<P>&nbsp;To get on the ssh discussion list, email majordomo@clinet.fi with



message "subscribe ssh."







<P>&nbsp;But ssh, like APOP will not protect your email. The solution?



Encryption. PGP is popular and can be purchased at http://pgp.com. I recommend



using the RSA option. It is a stronger algorithm than the default Diffie-Hellman



offered by PGP.







<P>************************************************************



<BR>Newbie note: Encryption is scrambling up a message so that it is very



hard for anyone to unscramble it unless they have the right key, in which



case it becomes easy to unscramble.



<BR>************************************************************



<BR>&nbsp;



<BR>************************************************************



<BR>Evil genius tip: While the RSA algorithm is the best one known, an



encryption program may implement it in an insecure manner. Worst of all,



RSA depends upon the unprovable mathematical hypothesis that there is no



polynomial time bounded algorithm for factoring numbers. That’s a good



reason to keep up on math news!



<BR>&nbsp;The key plot element of the movie “Sneakers” was a fictional



discovery of a fast algorithm to factor numbers. Way to go, Sneakers writer/producer



Larry Lasker!



<BR>************************************************************







<P>************************************************************



<BR>You can go to jail warning: In many countries there are legal restrictions



on encryption. In the US, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations



forbids export of any encryption software good enough to be worth using.



If we are serious about freedom of speech, we must find ways to keep our



communications private. So fighting controls on encryption is a key part



of winning the battle against repression on the Internet.



<BR>************************************************************







<P>Social Engineering







<P>&nbsp;As we saw in the GTMHH on how to break into computers, social



engineering usually consists of telling lies that are poorly thought through.



But a skilled social engineer can convince you that he or she is doing



you a big favor while getting you to give away the store. A really skilled



social engineer can get almost any information out of you without even



telling a lie.







<P>&nbsp;For example, one hacker posted his home phone number on the bulletin



board of a large company, telling the employees to call him for technical



support. He provided great tech support. In exchange, he got lots of passwords.



If he had been smart, he would have gotten a real tech support job, but



then I can never figure out some of these haxor types.







<P>ISP Hostage Taking







<P>&nbsp;A favorite ploy of the aggressor in a hacker war is to attack



the victim’s Internet account. Then they trumpet around about how this



proves the victim is a lamer.







<P>&nbsp;But none of us is responsible for managing the security at the



ISPs we use. Of course, you may get a domain name, set up a computer with



lots of security and hook it directly to an Internet backbone provider



with a 24 hr phone connection. Then, checking account depleted, you could



take responsibility for your own Internet host. But as we learned from



the AGIS attacks, even Internet backbones can get taken down.







<P>&nbsp;If you point this out, that you are not the guy running security



on the ISP you use, bad guy hackers will insult you by claiming that if



you really knew something, you would get a “secure” ISP. Yeah, right. Here’s



why it is always easy to break into your account on an ISP, and almost



impossible for your ISP to keep hackers out.







<P>&nbsp;While it is hard to break into almost any computer system from



the outside, there are vastly more exploits that will get you superuser



(root) control from inside a shell account. So all your attacker needs



to do is buy an account, or even use the limited time trial account many



ISPs offer, and the bad guy is ready to run rampant.



<BR>&nbsp;



<BR>&nbsp;You can increase your security by using an ISP that only offers



PPP (point to point) accounts. This is one reason that it is getting difficult



to get a shell account. Thanks, cybernazis, for ruining the Internet for



the rest of us.







<P>&nbsp;But even an ISP that just offers PPP accounts is more vulnerable



than the typical computer system you will find in a large corporation,



for the simple reason that your ISP needs to make it easy to use.



<BR>&nbsp;



<BR>********************************************************



<BR>Newbie note: A shell account lets you give Unix commands to the computer



you are on. A PPP account is used to see pretty pictures while you surf



the Web but in itself will not let you give Unix commands to the computer



you are logged into.



<BR>********************************************************







<P>&nbsp;Because it is easy to break into almost any ISP, haxor d00d cybernazis



think it is kewl to take an ISP hostage by repeatedly breaking in and vandalizing



it until the owner surrenders by kicking the victim of the attacks off.



This was the objective in the assaults on Succeed.net in Oct. 1997.







<P>*******************************************************



<BR>You can go to jail warning: I usually fubar the names of ISPs in these



guides because so many haxor types attack any computer system I write about.



Succeed.net is a real name. If you want to attack it, fine. Just remember



that we have boobytrapped the heck out of it. So if you attack, men in



suits bearing Miranda cards will pay you a visit.



<BR>*******************************************************







<P>Why Should I Give a Darn? -- Ways Bystanders Get Hurt







<P>&nbsp;To most people, hacker wars are Legion of Doom vs. Masters of



Deception stuff. Interesting, but like reading science fiction. But what



does it have to do with your life? You may figure that if you never do



anything that gets some computer dweeb who thinks he’s a haxor mad, you



won’t have a problem.







<P>&nbsp;Yet chances are that you may already have been brushed by hacker



war. Have you ever tried to login to your online provider and couldn’t



make a connection? Did you call tech support and they told you they were



“down for maintenance”? Tried to send email and gotten a message “cannot



send mail now. Please try again later”? Sent email that disappeared into



cyberspace without a trace? Gotten email back with a “User unknown” or



worse yet, “host unknown” message? Been unable to surf to your favorite



Web site?







<P>&nbsp;It could have been technical error (cough, cough). But it may



have been more. A cardinal rule of online services is to never, ever admit



in public to being hacked. Only if a reporter “outs” them first will they



reluctantly admit to the attack. This is because there are cybernazi gangs



that, when they hear of an online service under attack, join in the attack.



<BR>&nbsp;



<BR>&nbsp;Why cybernazis do this is not clear. However, what they accomplish



is to make it hard for small companies to compete with giants such as America



Online. The giant online services can afford a large staff of computer



security experts. So with the cybernazis rampaging against the little Internet



service providers, it is not surprising that so many of them are selling



out to the giants.







<P>&nbsp;I don’t have any evidence that the cybernazis are in the pay of



giants such as AOL. In fact, I suspect cybernazis are trying to drive the



small competitors out of business solely on the general principle that



they hate freedom of anything.







<P>&nbsp;It is common for hacker wars that start as a private disagreement



to spill over and affect thousands or even millions of bystanders.







<P>&nbsp;For example, in Sept. 1996, syn flood attackers shut down the



Panix ISP for several days. In Oct. 1997 the ISP Succeed.net was shut down



by a team of hackers that deleted not just Bronc's but also over 800 user



accounts. Many other ISPs have suffered shutdowns from hacker wars, often



because the attackers object to political views expressed on their Web



pages.



<BR>&nbsp;



<BR>&nbsp;On June 4, 1997, hacker wars made yet another quantum leap, shutting



down the Internet backbone service provider AGIS in retaliation for it



allowing Cyberpromo and several other spam empires to be customers.







<P>&nbsp;Tomorrow these skirmishes could pit nation against nation: power



grids that serve hundreds of millions failing in the dead of winter; air



traffic control systems going awry with planes crashing; hundreds of billions,



trillions of dollars in banking systems disappearing without a trace. Pearl



Harbor. Digital Pearl Harbor. Famine. Years before we could climb out of



an economic collapse as bad as the Great Depression.







<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You think this is a ridiculous



exaggeration? Those of use who have been in the bullseye of the cybernazis



find this future easy to believe.







<P>&nbsp;Winn Schwartau has been warning the world of this coming disaster



since June of 1991. Someone must be listening, because in September 1997



an industry group, formed in the wake of hearings by the US Senate’s Permanent



Subcommittee on Investigations, appointed Schwartau team leader, Manhattan



Cyber Project Information Warfare/Electronic Civil Defense (see http://www.warroomresearch.com/mcp/



and http://www.infowar.com).







<P>&nbsp;Schwartau, in his book Information Warfare, tells us about some



of the attacks the cybernazis have made on his family. These attacks have



included massive credit card fraud, tampering with his credit rating, turning



off his home power and phone, and even tampering with the local emergency



services dispatch system so that all ambulance, fire and police calls were



directed to his home instead of to those who called 911 for emergency help.







<P>&nbsp;Those of us on the front lines of cyberwar have seen these attacks



first hand. The cybernazis, as Schwartau discovered, were willing to even



risk the lives of people who had nothing to do with him.







<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we know hacker wars



do to us, and we know what it does to you bystanders.







<P>Why You May Get Hit







<P>&nbsp;Hacker war happens to other people, right? Spammers get hacked.



Hacker gangs pick fights with each other. But if you behave politely around



computer criminals, you are safe, right? OK, as long as you don’t live



in the neighborhood of one of us Internet freedom fighters like Schwartau



or me you are safe.







<P>&nbsp;Wrong. Dead wrong.







<P>&nbsp;Let’s look at an example of a hacker war, one that doesn’t seem



to have any motivation at all. We’re talking the Internet Chess Club. Not



exactly controversial.



<BR>In mid Sept. 1996 it was shut down by a syn flood attack in the aftermath



of daemon9 publishing a program to implement the attack in the ezine Phrack.







<P>&nbsp;There have bene many bystanders hit with the wars against this



Happy Hacker list. It all started with cybernazis who wanted stop you from



getting email from me. For example, on Dec. 6, 1996, someone had written



to the dc-stuff hackers email list (subscribe by emailing majordomo@dis.org



with message "subscribe dc-stuff) saying “I think they (or maybe 'we')



will survive, Carolyn's book.” Rogue Agent replied:



<UL>I'm just doing my part to make sure that it doesn't happen.&nbsp; Ask



not what the network can do for you, ask what you can do for the network.&nbsp;



We shall fight them in the routers, we shall fight them in the fiber, we



shall fight them in the vaxen... I'm an activist, and I won't stop my activism



just because I know others will take it too far.</UL>



&nbsp;On Dec 20 Rogue Agent wrote to me:



<UL>Ask Netta Gilboa; her magazine's in shambles and her boyfriend's in



prison, while she lives in fear.&nbsp; Ask Josh Quittner (author of&nbsp;



<U>Masters of Deception</U>); for a while there, he had to change his (unlisted)



phone number literally every two weeks because of the nightly anonymous



calls he was getting. Somehow they always got the new number.&nbsp; Ask



John Markoff (coauthor of the hacker best-seller Takedown); he can't even



let people know what his email account is or he gets spammed the next day.







<P>This is not a threat... All I'm doing is telling you what's coming...



you're playing with fire. There is a darker element in my culture, and



you're going to meet it if you keep going.</UL>



&nbsp;“This is not a threat.” Yeah, right. That’s what most of the guys



who threaten us say.







<P>&nbsp;Five days later, while it was still dark on Christmas morning,



the owner of the Southwest Cyberport ISP where I had an account was woken



by an alarm. His mail server was down. No one using that ISP could get



email any more. They had been hit by a massive mailbombing by someone styling



himself johnny xchaotic. jericho surfaced as the public spokesman for the



attacker, claiming intimate knowledge of his techniques and motivations.



<BR>&nbsp;



<BR>&nbsp;The evening of Dec. 28, someone cracked the dedicated box that



Cibola Communications had been providing us at no cost to run the Happy



Hacker majordomo. The intruder erased the system files and sent email to



the owners threatening worse mayhem if they didn’t cave in and boot us



off. The attackers also wiped the system files from a computer at the University



of Texas at El Paso that I was using for research, and sent threats to



all email addresses on that box. The attacker called himself GALF. It was



not the first or last time that GALF has struck Happy Hacker.







<P>&nbsp;Damaged computers, threats, extortion, blackmail. That's life



around here. After awhile it gets kinda boring, yawn -- just kidding.







<P>*********************************************************



<BR>Newbie note: In case you are wondering whether you can get killed in



one of these battles, I have found no reports, not even rumors, of any



hacker war murders. These guys only kill people by accident as a side effect



of their digital mayhem. Like sending an ambulance that could save a dying



child to the home of an Internet freedom fighter instead. However, if someone



should threaten to kill you, you should report it and any associated computer



attacks. Despite what you may hear, those of us hackers who are not computer



criminals cooperate enthusiastically with law enforcement.



<BR>*********************************************************







<P>How to Get into a Hacker War







<P>&nbsp;“I want to fight in a hacker war. How do I get in?”







<P>&nbsp;I get email like this all the time. Many newbie hackers long for



my frequent experiences of being attacked by a talented gang of computer



criminals. The excitement! The opportunity to go mano a mano with bad dudes



and prove you are better than them!







<P>&nbsp;There is some truth to this view. To be honest, I get a thrill



fighting those criminals -- using legal tactics, of course. Believe me,



if we catch the Succeed.net attackers, you will hear about it. But before



you make the decision to join us freedom fighters, count up the cost. It



isn't always fun.







<P>&nbsp;But I’ve stood up to them. And, shoot, I’m just an old lady. So



if you want to attract a hacker war, and believe you are as tough or tougher



than me, be my guest. But before you start provoking attacks, please wait



for me to get out the next two parts of this Information Warfare series,



so you can learn how to repair your credit rating and recover from other



digital disasters. You’ll find plenty of things in the next Guides in this



series that will help you survive even the most determined hacker war.



Even the kind of war that attempts to steal all you own, wipe out your



identity, and threaten the lives of your family.







<P>&nbsp;So just how do you get into a hacker war? The easiest way is to



attend a hacker convention. There are all sorts of twisted people at these



things, kind of like the bar scene in Star Wars. “He said, he doesn’t like



the way you look.” If you fail to grovel and suck up to those d00dz, or,



worse yet, tell them firmly that you favor freedom of speech, or even worse



yet, make fun of them for being cybernazis, you can be in for lots of excitement.







<P>How to Keep from Getting Caught -- NOT!







<P>&nbsp;So you want to be the attacker in a hacker war? So you think you



can keep from getting caught? According to jericho, writing in his “F***ed



Up College Kids” ezine, “You have media whores like Carolyn Meinel trying



to teach people to hack, writing guides to hacking full of f***ups. Telling



these people what to do, but not giving them enough information to adequately



protect themselves.”







<P>&nbsp;I agree with jericho, if you decide to become a computer criminal



in a hacker war, I’m not talented enough to teach you how to keep from



getting caught.







<P>&nbsp;In fact, no one can teach you how to keep from getting caught.



I’ll tell you exactly why, too.







<P>&nbsp;At a Def Con V panel I hosted (Las Vegas, July 1997), jericho



boasted “When I break in, I close the doors behind me.” He makes a big



deal about how hackers can keep from getting busted by deleting or modifying



log files. Yeah. Right. Not!







<P>&nbsp;Let me tell you the REAL story about what happens when hackers



think they are covering their tracks. Sure, an ordinary sysadmin can’t



restore a deleted file on a Unix system. But there are people out there



with the technology to restore deleted files -- even files that have been



overwritten hundred of times. They can restore them regardless of operating



system. There are people out there who can extract everything that has



been on a hard disk for the last several months -- or years. I know those



people. I arrange for them to read those hard disks. Guess who’s toast:):):)







<P>&nbsp;Then there is surveillance. Some 31337 haxor is sitting at his



box raising hell and “closing doors after him.” What he doesn’t know is



that thanks to a court order inspired by his boasts, someone is sitting



in a van a hundred yards away -- picking up every keystroke. Van Eck radiation,



luser. Or picking up the signals that run down the power cord of your computer.



Ever heard of Tempest?







<P>&nbsp;Even if the cybercrime detective doesn’t have all this high-tech



hardware on hand, the history of hacker crime shows that criminals will



talk in exchange for lenient sentencing. Commit one easy-to-prove federal



felony, let’s say posting someone’s stolen email on one’s public ftp server



(who do we know who has done this?), and the Feds have lots of bargaining



power against him.







<P>&nbsp;So even if I wanted to help people become ubercriminals, I can’t.



Not because I don’t know how. Because there is no way. The 31337 d00dz



who tell you otherwise are seriously ignorant.







<P>&nbsp;I predict the Succeed.net attackers are will wind up in jail.



Soon. Perhaps not for that crime. But their days of freedom are numbered.



It is only a matter of picking which of their many crimes will hold up



best in court, and who will give evidence against whom. Time to study game



theory -- can you say “prisoners’ dilemma,” wannabe ubercriminals? Who’s



the narc?







<P>&nbsp;“But, but,” I can hear the Super Duper computer criminals sputtering.



“My buddies and I break the law all the time and we’ve never been busted.



OK, OK, my other buddy got busted, but he was lame.”







<P>&nbsp;It’s just a matter of time. They need to go straight before their



number is up. Or make the decision to obtain their “get out of jail free”



cards by informing on their gang before their day of doom comes up. They



have much better bargaining power if they make a deal before arrest.

<P>How to Protect yourself in a Hacker War







<P>&nbsp;What, you don’t find getting caught up in a hacker war immensely



entertaining? You don’t want to be the innocent bystander caught in the



crossfire of an rm command? Here are a few rules that can help you. But



remember, these are only the most basic of protections. We’ll cover the



industrial-strength techniques in later Guides in this series, as well



as how to catch the culprits.







<P>Top Ten Beginner Defenses in Hacker Wars







<P>10) Backup, backup, backup.



<BR>9) Assume anything is being sniffed, unless protected by strong encryption.



<BR>8) Assume your phone is tapped.



<BR>7) Never, never, ever telnet into your shell account. Use Secure Shell



instead.



<BR>6) Pick a good password. It should be long, not a name or a word from



a dictionary, and should include numbers and/or characters such as !@#$%^&amp;*.



If you use a computer where others have physical access to it, don’t write



your password on anything.



<BR>5) This applies to shell accounts: assume your attacker will get root



control anyhow, so your password won’t do you any good. That means you



should encrypt any files you don’t want to have passed around, and send



your shell history files to /dev/null each time you log out.



<BR>4) Do you use the Pine or Elm email programs? Don’t keep email addresses



in your shell account. Your saved mail files are a good place for cybernazis



to find email addresses and send out threatening and obscene messages to



them. GALF specializes in this tactic.



<BR>3) Regularly patrol your Web site. You never know when it may sprout



rude body parts or naughty words. Preferably use a Web server hosted on



a computer system dedicated to nothing but Web sites. Best of all, use



a MacOS web server.



<BR>2)Disable Java on your Web browser. Don’t even *think* of using ActiveX



or Internet Explorer.







<P>And, the number one defense:







<P>1) Join us Internet freedom fighters. It will take many of us to win



the battle against those who want to pick and choose whose voices will



be heard on the Internet.
