Guide to (mostly) Harmless Hacking



Vol. 6 Real Hackers



No. 1: Eric S. Raymond

_________________________________________________________

	"Hackers built the Internet. Hackers made the UNIX operating system what

it is today. Hackers run Usenet. Hackers make the World Wide Web work. If

you are part of this culture, if you have contributed to it and other

people in it know who you are and call you a hacker, you're a hacker... 

	

	"There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, but

aren't. These are people (mainly adolescent males) who get a kick out of

breaking into computers and phreaking the phone system. Real hackers call

these people `crackers' and want nothing to do with them. Real hackers

mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not very bright, and

object that being able to break security doesn't make you a hacker any more

than being able to hotwire cars makes you an automotive engineer.

Unfortunately, many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the

word `hacker' to describe crackers; this irritates real hackers no end. 

	

	"The basic difference is this: 

		hackers build things, crackers break them... 



	Hackerdom's most revered demigods are people who have written large,

capable programs that met a widespread need and given them away, so that now

everyone uses them.



	"If you want to be a hacker, keep reading. If you want to be a cracker, go

read the alt.2600 newsgroup and get ready to do five to ten in the slammer

after finding out you aren't as smart as you think you are. And that's all

I'm going to say about crackers." -- Eric S. Raymond,

	Who are the real hackers? Who are the people we can admire and model our

lives upon? The Real Hackers series of these Guides introduces these people. 



	We start with Eric S. Raymond. He is well known in the hacker world. He

epitomizes all that a real hacker should be. He has wide ranging

programming experience: C, LISP, Pascal, APL, FORTRAN, Forth, Perl, and

Python; and is proficient in assembly language for the Z80, 80x86, and 680xx

CPUs. He also knows French, Spanish and Italian.

 	Raymond is one of the core developers of Linux, and a major force in the

ongoing evolution of the EMACS Lisp language. He maintains fetchmail, a

freeware utility for retrieving and forwarding mail from POP2/POP3/IMAP

mailservers.	



	But Raymond is perhaps most famous among real hackers as the man who

maintains the hacker jargon file. You can read it at

			<A HREF="http://www.ccil.org/jargon">http://www.ccil.org/jargon</A>. 



	He also maintains numerous other well-regarded FAQ and HOWTO documents,

including the "Java-On-Linux HOWTO," the "Linux Distributions HOWTO," the

"PC-Clone UNIX Hardware Buyer's Guide," the "So You Want To Be A UNIX

Wizard? FAQ" (aka The Loginataka), and the "How To Become A Hacker FAQ" --

	see <A HREF="http://locke.ccil.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">http://locke.ccil.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html</A> (quoted above). 

	

	Raymond also founded and runs the Chester County InterLink. This is a

501(c)3 nonprofit organization that gives free InterNet access to the

residents of Chester County, Pennsylvania. At last count, it had over two

thousand users and was gaining about fifty a week.



	Raymond also has written the funniest hacker humor ever: "Unix Wars,"

which builds upon the really, really ancient hacker humor article, "DEC

Wars." You may read it at <A HREF="http://www.devnull.net/docs/unixwars.html">http://www.devnull.net/docs/unixwars.html</A>.



	Raymond is the author of many books. They include "The New Hackers

Dictionary," now in its 3rd edition (MIT Press 1996, ISBN 0-262-68092-0),

and "Learning GNU Emacs," (2nd edition, O'Reilly Associates, ISBN

0-937175-84-6). He was the principal researcher and author of "Portable C

and UNIX Systems Programming," (Prentice-Hall ISBN 0-13-686494-5) (the name

"J. E. Lapin" appearing on the cover was a corporate fiction). The advent of

the September 1996 third edition of "Portable C..." led to interviews with

Raymond in Wired magazine (August 1996) and People magazine (October 1996).

	"Wait, wait!" you say. "I'm on hacker IRC channels and hacker mail lists

all the time and I have never heard of Raymond! Why, he doesn't even have a

kewl handle like Mauve Knight or Ei8ht or DisordeR. Sheesh, Raymond isn't

even a member of some 31337 gang with a name like K-rad Doomsters of the

Apocalypse."

	

	Welcome to the world of real hackers. As Raymond points out in his "How To

Become A Hacker FAQ," there are two kinds of hackers: real hackers who

aspire to learn and create, and the phonies who think crashing or breaking

into a computer proves they are geniuses. 



	Guess which kind you usually meet at 2600 meetings, on IRC channels with

names like #hack, on news groups such as alt.2600 and alt.hacker, and mail

lists with names like DC-stuff and HH-Chat? That is not to say that every

single person you will meet there is a lamer and a poser. But few real

hackers will put up with the flames, criminal mentality and ignorance of the

majority of folks you encounter there.



	Where do you meet real hackers like Raymond? You might encounter a few of

them at the annual Def Con or Hope on Planet Earth conferences. (Raymond,

however, asserts this is "not likely.") You will, however, find real hackers

by the hundreds at the Usenix conferences 

		(see <A HREF="http://www.usenix.org/events/">http://www.usenix.org/events/</A>), or by the thousands in the free

software movement. 



*********************************************************

Newbie note: How can you get involved in the free software movement and get

to know the hacker demigods? For starters, try GNU. GNU stands for "Gnu's

Not UN-IX." The GNU project is an international effort that is being run by

the Free Software Foundation. See <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org">http://www.gnu.org</A> for more information.

Are you wondering, "Gnu's Not UN-IX? Whaddaya mean?" Be warned, real hackers

have a twisted sense of humor. GNU is a recursive acronym. When the mere

thought of a recursive acronym can throw you into gales of laughter, you

will know you are turning into a real hacker.

*********************************************************



	"The free software movement?" you ask. "How come no one ever, ever talks

about coding operating system kernels or new scripting languages on

alt.2600 or dc-stuff?" Yup, you guessed it, it's because the majority of

those folks just want to f*** things up. Real hackers aspire to create

software. Not just exploit code for f***ing up computers. But to create

serious, big time software.



	The free software movement is where Raymond and his friends -- folks such

as Linus Torvalds (the fellow who launched and ran the Linux project that

created the operating system most widely used by hackers) and Larry Wall

(creator of Perl, one of the top two programming languages used by hackers)

work together. 



	Much of the software these hacker demigods write is copylefted. A copyleft

is -- yes, you are right, a copyleft is another example of twisted hacker

humor. But basically a copyleft says you have the right to reuse copylefted

code in your own software, and even sell it, and make money on it, with

only one condition. You must make the source code to your software

available for anyone else who may wish to use it in writing their own

software.



	Want to hang out with the hacker demigods? Have you learned to program

pretty well yet? If so, you may discover a warm welcome from the GNU folks

and others in the free software movement.



	How did Raymond become one of the tribal elders of the hacker world? It

all started, he remembers, in 1968 when he was only 11. "My father worked

for Sperry Univac. On days off he would take me in to play with the 1108.

It was worth about $8 million -- in 1968 dollars!" Raymond remembers it

being a

gigantic computer housed in an air-conditioned room. 



	Back then it was a major feat for anyone to get their hands on a computer.

 Back then they were primitive, expensive and fragile. Raymond remembers

reading the ACM journal in 1974 and dreaming about how wonderful it would

be if he could ever get his hands on that new operating system they were

creating -- Unix. While in high school he did manage to get access -- via

teletype -- to a TTY (a verrry primitive terminal) at Ursinus College

(located in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania). With that TTY he was able to use

the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System computer. But it was mostly just good for

playing games.



	Raymond began college as a math and philosophy major. But in 1976 he got

his hands on an account with a DEC PDP-10 -- and a connection to ARPAnet,

the early form of today's Internet. "I was seduced by the computing side."

Raymond soon switched to computer science.



	While on ARPAnet, visiting a computer at MIT, Raymond discovered the

Hacker Jargon File. Raymond was hooked. He decided he would become a

hacker. A real hacker.	



	In 1983 Raymond printed out the jargon file, bound it as a book, titled it

"Understanding Your Hacker," and presented it to his boss. His boss loved it.



	Back in 1983, few people were afraid of those who called themselves

hackers. Back then people were aware that hackers were odd and brilliant

characters. But that was before crowds of vandals and criminals started

claiming they, too, were hackers. Journalists, at a loss as to what to call

that new breed of digital gang bangers, started calling them hackers, too. 



	Meanwhile, Raymond came to the realization that he not only had a talent

for programming -- he could write texts really well, too. In 1987 he

updated "DEC Wars" to create the immortal "Unix Wars," which will finally

see print for the first time in Carolyn Meinel's "Happy Hacker" book

(American Eagle Publications, in press, due out in late Feb. 1998). 



        In 1990 Raymond decided to spend a weekend updating the Hacker

Jargon File. When Monday morning rolled around, he had quadrupled the size

of the file. He contacted the folks who maintained it, who were delighted to

let him take it over. Not long afterward, he published it as "The New

Hacker's Dictionary."



	So what is Raymond doing today? "I do most of my programming in C," he

tells us, "but I still think in Lisp."  He works "the odd consulting job,

technical reviews of books for publishers like O'Reilly." Adds Raymond,

laughing, "They know I know where all the bodies are buried." 



	Where does Raymond see the hacker culture going? "It used to be hard to

acculturate, hard to find the hacker community. But now it's expanding

tremendously, thanks to the Linux phenomenon. Linux really made a

difference. Now we have a common goal, and a universal platform for people's

software projects. Perl has had a similar effect, providing us with a

cross-platform tool kit."



	Raymond sees some hope even in the fast-growing, yet incredibly

destructive "cracker" scene (crackers are people who break into computers).

"People in  the cracker community play awhile, then eventually the bright

ones end up  coming over to the free software culture. Many of them write

to me." Raymond says he has communicated with many people who have gone

through a digital vandal stage, only to eventually wake up and realize they

wanted to feel good about themselves by making the world a better place.



	So, how many future hacker demigods are reading this Guide? Maybe quite a

few. May the Source Code be with you if you should choose to quest for

hacker fame the Raymond way!
