<P>Vol. 5 Programmers' Series

<P>No. 4: A nice 'n' easy introduction into the bash shell
<BR>_________________________________________________________

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By idle (<A HREF="mailto:idle@mailexcite.com">idle@mailexcite.com</A>)
<BR>with a little help from his friends (Meino :) (Carolyn Meinel)
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;The first in the Programmers' Series introduced you to some of
the very
<BR>basics of writing shell scripts. Creating files, executing commands
and so
<BR>on.&nbsp; This Guide will introduce you to additional important concepts,
but
<BR>this time using the bash shell.

<P>&nbsp;Why is shell programming important for hacking?&nbsp; Let's say
you are trying
<BR>to get root control of a Hacker Wargame computer (see
<BR><A HREF="http://www.happyhacker.org">http://www.happyhacker.org</A>
for latest information on what computers are
<BR>legal to break into).&nbsp; You find an exploit shell script at some
place such
<BR>as <A HREF="http://www.rootshell.com">http://www.rootshell.com</A>
that looks ideal for doing the job -- but it
<BR>doesn't work!&nbsp; Maybe your problem was not with the exploit script,
but with
<BR>what shell you are using or how your shell is set up.&nbsp; This Guide
will help
<BR>you understand more about what makes the bash shell work and how to
make it
<BR>do what you want it to do.

<P>******************************************************************
<BR>In this Guide you will learn about:
<BR>* The shell "environment"
<BR>* variables
<BR>* processes (parent and child processes)
<BR>* the bash prompt -- how to customize it
<BR>* tilde expansion
<BR>* aliases
<BR>* creating your bash startup (profile) file
<BR>* how to write scripts in bash
<BR>******************************************************************

<P>******************************************************************
<BR>Newbie note: Bash is a Unix shell program.&nbsp; It takes all your
commands and
<BR>turns them into something a Unix type operating system can understand.&nbsp;
I
<BR>(Carolyn Meinel) recommend the tcsh shell, but if you can't use tcsh
right
<BR>now, bash is my second favorite shell.&nbsp; Bash stands for "Bourne
Again
<BR>Shell," a word play on the Bourne Shell, from which the bash shell
was
<BR>adapted.&nbsp; To find out whether you are currently using the bash
shell, in
<BR>your shell account give the command "env".&nbsp; It will include an
entry
<BR>"SHELL:bash" if you are already using it.&nbsp; If&nbsp; it shows a
different shell,
<BR>give the command "bash".&nbsp; If it gives an error message, you don't
have bash.
<BR>******************************************************************

<P>&nbsp; You'll soon see that even your most basic shell in any kind of
Unix is
<BR>more powerful than DOS, and if you are short of ideas for scripts to
write,
<BR>hopefully this will open your mind a little.

<P>Environment Variables

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have any programming experience at all, or
you have been reading
<BR>the Guides like a good little hacker, then you will know about Variables.
<BR>Think of these as named pieces of your computer's memory which hold
values.
<BR>Depending upon the variables in question, you may or may not have immediate
<BR>control of their contents.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another concept is your environment, which is what you
find when you give
<BR>the "env" command. Much like the real world you live in, your environment
in
<BR>your shell stores information such as the operating system you are
running,
<BR>the version, your home directory, a list of directories to look at
when you
<BR>want to run a program, and so on.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the more common bash environment variables that
you will want to
<BR>know a bit about are:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; PATH
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is a colon-separated list of directories
which bash uses to
<BR>search for commands. eg:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/newstuff/progs

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; HOME
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the current users home directory, eg:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /home/bob

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; CDPATH
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a colon-seperated list of directories
to search when you issue the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd command, eg:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /home:/usr/local/etc:/usr/local/games
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if you had a directory under /usr/local/etc
called myGreatProg,&nbsp; you
<BR>could issue a cd myGreatProg on the command line and you would be taken
to
<BR>the first occurrence of myGreatProg in CDPATH. In this case,
<BR>/usr/local/etc/myGreatProg. When it comes down to it, this is not necessary,
<BR>it's just a nicety which can confuse you at times. Use with care!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; MAILPATH
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a colon-separated list of spool files
which bash checks periodically
<BR>for new mail, eg:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/spool/mail/bob:/var/spool/bob

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; PS1 &amp; PS2
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; primary and secondary prompt strings.
The primary prompt is used at
<BR>your standard interactive shell. ie; when you log in or you run bash.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The secondary prompt is used when bash
needs more input to complete a
<BR>command. for example, at the prompt, type:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd
\

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bash will change the prompt to ">" or
whatever your PS2 is set to,
<BR>indicating that you need to type more before it can execute your
<BR>instruction. Try typing:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and after you press ENTER, the complete
command will have been "cd ~".
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This takes you to your home directory.
The backslash "\" indicated
<BR>that the command continues on the next line. This can be used in your
<BR>scripts as well for long lines that you don't want to get too messy.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; RANDOM
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a nice variable which you can
call upon to give you a random
<BR>number. Assigning a number to this will allow you to generate a seed.
This
<BR>is a nifty idea, but unfortunately, it is not entirely random. After
<BR>executing this a few times, I noticed a pattern, so if you are going
to use
<BR>It, take care. Mind you, if you were going to write some really flash
crypto
<BR>routine, then you'd probably be using a programming language as opposed
to a
<BR>scripting language :)

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To set variables, you can use the set command, eg:

<P>set TEMP_VAR=cheese

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this will not export it into the environment
in bash. to do that,
<BR>you must use export, eg:

<P>xport TEMP_VAR

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can, however, just use export, thus:

<P>export TEMP_VAR=cheese

<P>Processes

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concept of the environment now comes into full
effect. When you are
<BR>in your bash shell and you execute a command or script, that command
<BR>INHERITS it's parent process's environment. The shell in this case
is the
<BR>parent process, and the command or script you run is the child process.
This
<BR>child process can in turn start a child process of it's own. The concept
of
<BR>child and parent is relative to which process you are talking about.
Any
<BR>process that starts a child becomes that child's parent. Much like
in real
<BR>life. You are a child, but may eventually become a parent as well.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Init is the Mother Of All Processes. Think of it
as god if you are
<BR>religious.&nbsp; If you're not religious, think of it as a The Big
Bang. Or
<BR>anything else that pleases you.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To see how your children and their parents are doing,
use the command
<BR>'pstree', or if you don't have that, 'ps -f' to get a list of every
process
<BR>running and how it relates to init.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are we going off on a tangent? Probably...anyway,
when you type a
<BR>command, you will notice a variable called $_ is being set. We'll see
soon
<BR>what this is actually doing.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's try an example. Type this:

<P>set hi_temp="Hi, this is TEMP"
<BR>set | less

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: if you don't have less, use more. ;)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will see at this point, no variable called $hi_temp.
but at the
<BR>bottom, you should see

<P>=hi_temp=Hi, This is TEMP

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then type:

<P>set hi_test="Hi, this is TEST"
<BR>set | less

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take note there is now no reference to "hi_temp".
But one of the last
<BR>lines should read "_=hi_test=Hi, this is TEST."

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The variable $_ is actually just a reminder of the
last command you
<BR>typed, not a place to remember set commands. You will find very quickly
that
<BR>unless you explicitly use export in the first instance in the shell
(not in
<BR>a script file), you will not be able to export to the environment.
This is
<BR>because the set command runs as a child process which eats it's own
variables.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can prove this to yourself by doing the following:

<P>set hi_test="Hi, this is TEST"
<BR>ls
<BR>set| grep "hi_test"

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will have nothing returned back. Whereas if you
had done:

<P>export hi_test="Hi, this is TEST"
<BR>ls
<BR>set | grep "hi_test"

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bash will return:

<P>hi_test=Hi, this is TEST

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the variable is in the environment, it can be
accessed by the child
<BR>processes. Note that the parent process will not inherit any variables
from
<BR>the children. This is very dangerous.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In scripts, if you are setting variables to be used locally
in the
<BR>script, you won't have to export. But if you wish for those processes
your
<BR>script calls, ie, another script, then you will have to export.

<P>More on Variables

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To reference variables on the command line or in
your scripts, you will
<BR>have to prepend the variable name with the String symbol, or the dollar
sign
<BR>($). Take the following simple example entered at the command line

<P>export HI=hello
<BR>echo "$HI"

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The output after the echo command is:

<P>hello

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you had just typed 'echo "HI"' as your last command,
what do you
<BR>think would have been displayed? All those who replied 'HI' get to
buy
<BR>themselves a chocolate fish. Note that after the echo command, no matter
<BR>whether we are using variables or not, I use quote marks (") before
and
<BR>after the string to be echoed. This is best shown by example. Type
the
<BR>following at the prompt:

<P>export HI="*"
<BR>echo $HI

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will get the equivalent of the current directory's
listing dumped
<BR>out. But if you go:

<P>echo "$HI"

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bash will display

<P>*

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which is what you wanted. IE; the CONTENTS of the
variable. bash likes
<BR>to substitute commands before executing. Remember when to use quotes
and you
<BR>will be fine.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To display a variable already set in place, you just
use echo, eg:

<P>echo "$PS1"

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will probably give you:

<P>&nbsp;\h:\w\$

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't worry if yours is slightly different. Now you
can create and
<BR>reference variables.

<P>The Bashg Prompt

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the equivalent to using the DOS PROMPT command
or the tcsh
<BR>set prompt= command. In bash, the variable that stores what your prompt
<BR>is to display is $PS1.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To change this you simply need to do something basic like:

<P>export PS1="this is my computer: "

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And next time you look, your prompt will read:

<P>this is my computer:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This prompt will wait for you to enter a command.
You will notice that
<BR>this is now set. Press ENTER, type "ls", it stays. Great! But that
is a
<BR>little boring.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What you want it to do is display your user name
and/or the current
<BR>directory you are in so that you don't have to use pwd (the command
to show
<BR>your directory) constantly.&nbsp; Bash allows you to use switches (as
seen when
<BR>we did an echo $PS1 earlier) to display lots of useful info. Here is
a list
<BR>of the main ones:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; \d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; date (format: ddd mmm dd - eg: Sat
Mar 12)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; \h&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; display your computers hostname
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; newline
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; \s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shell name (ie: bash)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; \t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time (24 hour format: hh:mm:ss -
eg: 16:22:08)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; \u&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; current user
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; \w&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; working directory (this changes on
the fly to the directory
<BR>that you change to).
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; \$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; display $ character
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; \\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; display \ character

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are others, but these will be the most useful
to you. Play around
<BR>and see what others you can find.

<P>Tilde Expansion

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another neat thing that bash provides is what is
called Tilde Expansion.
<BR>The tilde key (~) on it's own is expanded out to the user's home directory,
<BR>for example. You can see this by issuing a 'cd ~' on your command line.
Here
<BR>is a list of expansions that bash will give you:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expands to
$HOME
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~bob&nbsp; expands to bob's home directory
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $PWD
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $OLDPWD

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; These expansions basically replace themselves on the command
line with
<BR>the contents of the second column above. Once the command has been
expanded,
<BR>bash executes it.

<P>Aliases

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the things I could not do without is the alias
command. If you
<BR>enter any aliases, bash will fill out the text of the alias name with
<BR>whatever the alias contents is before executing the command.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, when I use ls, I like to see my directory
listing in a
<BR>certain way. Colors, for example, are good. I also like slashes (/)
at the
<BR>end of directory names just to show they are directories, and I also
like to
<BR>view all files starting with a full stop (.) in my listings.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; So instead of typing 'ls -Aop' every single time I want
a dir listing, I
<BR>just use an alias so that -Aop becomes my default. I enter the command:

<P>alias ls='ls -Aop'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And from then on, bash uses that alias as my default
command. Whenever I
<BR>enter the alias name (in this case 'ls'), bash expands that out to
'ls
<BR>-Aop'automatically for me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I want to remove the alias, I use 'unalias ls'.
Alternatively, I can
<BR>opt to type 'unalias -a' to remove all aliases I have set.

<P>Bash Startup File

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have read the previous guides, you will know
that bash provides
<BR>you with some startup files which get run whenever you log into a bash
<BR>shell. The file I am talking about is your profile. This can be called
<BR>.bash_profile, .bash_login, or .profile and is located in your home
directory.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't have this file, then just create it in your
favorite text
<BR>editor. Then you can insert any alias commands you want, and next time
you
<BR>log in, they will all be active.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, you can write the file now and use the 'source'
command to execute
<BR>your profile without logging out:

<P>source .profile

<P>(or substitute for ".profile" whatever your profile is called.)

<P>**********************************************************************
<BR>&nbsp; You can kill your account -- warning!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;Adding things to .profile should be tested ONLY with the "source
<BR>.profile"&nbsp; command!!! And only if you are satisfied with the result,
log out
<BR>and login again!!!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Reason: Imagine you wrote an "exit" at the wrong place
(i.e. not
<BR>preceding it with a comment-sign), you will never be able to login!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; A solution is to login twice, one shell is good for testing
the other one
<BR>for recovering from errors!!!&nbsp; You can login twice with the command
"telnet
<BR>localhost". Then if you mess up in this second shell you will wind
up back
<BR>in your first shell and can delete the profile file before it kills&nbsp;&nbsp;
your
<BR>shell again.&nbsp; This saves the embarrassment of having to call tech
support
<BR>and confess to having made a big mess of your account.
<BR>**********************************************************************

<P>Let's Script!

<P>&nbsp;So now that we've got all that basic stuff out of the way, let's
get into
<BR>some serious shell scripting.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know how to string commands together by now;
you just create a text
<BR>file, start listing any commands you want to execute, save the file,
change
<BR>its permissions (chmod +x &lt;filename>) and viola, you have a shell
script.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what if you want to do something more? What if
you want to pass
<BR>parameters on the command line? What if you want to check for files
<BR>existence before executing a command? What if you want to compare the
values
<BR>of two variables?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What indeed? You will need to know a bit about Loop
Constructs and
<BR>Conditional Constructs.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Loop constructs are:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Conditional constructs are:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will list the syntaxes of each and give basic real
life examples to
<BR>help you along your way. None of these are exhaustive, but they will
give
<BR>you a good foothold to allow you to further research bash and learn
how to
<BR>kick serious butt.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing to remember with the following constructs
is that they are not
<BR>like most other languages you may be used to. When you do a test, you
are
<BR>actually executing commands. Whether these are commands built-in to
bash, or
<BR>whether they are other commands it doesn't matter, but you can't get
away
<BR>with direct comparisons of variables. You'll see in the examples. Also,
all
<BR>semi-colons (;) can be replaced with newlines.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; ********************************************************************
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; IMPORTANT NOTE:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; bash is VERY space sensitive. Unless you copy any example
scripts
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; EXACTLY, you will most likely encounter problems.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; ********************************************************************

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; UNTIL
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Syntax:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
until &lt;test>; do &lt;commandlist>; done
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Description:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;commandlist> will continue to be executed until &lt;test>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
has an exit status which is not zero (ie; until it's not
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
false)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example script:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --------
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#!/bin/bash
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
counter=1
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
until [ "$counter" = "10" ]
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
do
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
echo $counter
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
let counter+=1
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
done
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
--------

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This script is very simple. It sets a variable called
"counter" and
<BR>initializes it to a value of 1. (We don't need to export it as it doesn't
<BR>need to be in the environment. Only this script will be using it.)

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then we want to echo a list from 1 to 10, so we do
the comparison. We
<BR>put the test arguments into square brackets so that bash knows we are
doing
<BR>a comparison. It will keep looping until the variable counter reaches
a
<BR>value of "10".

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The line "let counter+=1" is saying "take the contents
of the variable
<BR>counter, add 1 to it, and save the value back into counter. We could
have
<BR>also typed:

<P>let counter=$counter+1

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Note where you use the $ preceding the variable names and
when you don't.
<BR>When we want to display the actual value in the variable we use $variable.
<BR>When we want to reference the variable for the reasons of changing
it, we
<BR>just use variable.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 'let' command allows you to do mathematical equations.
<BR>Alternatively, you can wrap the equation in $[]. For the example above,
it
<BR>would be:

<P>$[counter+=1]

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is know as Arithmetic Expansion, and I have
found it to be less
<BR>reliable than using the let command. Also, using let makes your scripts
that
<BR>much more readable in the future.

<P>Mathematical Operators:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; So you know what sort of mathematical operators you can
use, here is a list:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unary
minus and plus

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ! ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; logical
and bitwise negation

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * / %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; multiplication,
division, remainder

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; addition,
subtraction

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;&lt; >>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; left and
right bitwise shifts

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;= >= &lt; >&nbsp; comparison

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; == !=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equality and
inequality

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bitwise AND

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bitwise exclusive OR

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bitwise OR

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
logical AND

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ||&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
logical OR

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = *= /= %= += -= &lt;&lt;= >>= &amp;=
^= |=
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
assignment operators

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; WHILE
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Syntax:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
while &lt;test>; do &lt;commandlist>; done
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Description:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
do &lt;commandlist> while &lt;test> has an exit status
<BR>of zero. (ie; true)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example Script:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --------
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #!/bin/bash
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; counter=1
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while [ "$counter"
!= "11" ]
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
echo $counter
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
let counter+=1
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; done
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --------

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We use the same script here using a different method
of testing. This
<BR>script will continue to loop while the variable $counter is not 11.
This
<BR>means that it will happily process the commandlist until $counter equals
11.
<BR>Note that this is a string comparison, not an integer (numerical) comparison.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; FOR
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Syntax:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
for &lt;var> [in &lt;list>]; do &lt;commandlist>; done
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Description:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This will execute &lt;commandlist> for each item in
<BR>&lt;list>.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If the optional [in &lt;list>] is left out, bash
<BR>will replace this with $@.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example Script:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --------
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #!/bin/bash
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for i in cheese comics
"computers which don't suck" motorbikes
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
echo "I like $i"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; done
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --------

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will display:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like cheese
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like comics
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like computers which don't suck
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like motorbikes

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, each word is treated as a separate
parameter unless you
<BR>use quotes to block a group of words.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; IF
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Syntax:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
if &lt;test>; then
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;commandlist>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
elif &lt;test2>; then
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;commandlist>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
elif &lt;test...>; then
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;commandlist>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
else
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;commandlist>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
fi

<P>Description:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This command is rather more
complex in nature. Using elif,
<BR>you can include as many tests as you like. If the
<BR>script fails to find a match in any of the tests, it
<BR>will default to executing the commandlist under else.

<P>The &lt;test> has an extensive list of parameters you can
<BR>pass which allow you to test for various things
<BR>including whether files exist on your hard drive,
<BR>comparing 2 variables, etc.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example script:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --------
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #!/bin/bash
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if [ -z $1 ]
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
echo "enter your favorite band name"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
exit
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fi

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if [ "$1" = "manowar"
]
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
echo "the greatest band on the planet!"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elif [ "$1" = "DIO"
]
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
echo "awesome! they rock!"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elif [ "$1" = "KISS"
]
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
echo "ah. that's taking me back..."
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
echo "never heard of $1"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fi
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --------

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, if you don't know it already, $1 indicated
the first parameter on
<BR>a command line. For example, if you enter 'cd /home/me', "/home/me"
is the
<BR>first parameter that you have entered. Inside the script, or the cd
command,
<BR>it could be referred to as $1. $2 is second, $3 is the third, etc.
One nice
<BR>ability is to use $0, which refers to the calling command - in this
case
<BR>"cd." Even batter is $* which stores all command line parameters, except
$0.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK, next we introduce two kinds of tests in the if
construct. -z checks
<BR>to see if the user has entered any parameters, and promptly informs
them
<BR>when they forget to do so.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next one which is used in the rest of the script
compares two
<BR>variables. Both are wrapped in quote marks to avoid bash trying to
execute
<BR>them as commands.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another point to note is make sure to separate the
square brackets,
<BR>otherwise bash will get confused.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other useful if lines:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if [ -f ~/.profile ]
<BR>(checks to see if you have a .profile file in you current home dir.
<BR>If so, the test will pass TRUE)

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if [ ! -f ~/.profile ]
<BR>(checks to see if ~/.profile is NOT there and return TRUE if the
<BR>file is NOT there.)

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take note, this only checks for the existence of
files, not directories.
<BR>Can you figure out how to make it check for the existence of directories?
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; CASE
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Syntax:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
case &lt;var> in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
pattern [| pattern]) &lt;commandlist> ;;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
pattern [| pattern]) &lt;commandlist> ;;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
esac
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Description:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The case command firstly expands whatever is in
<BR>&lt;var> and compares it to all the patterns listed. If it finds a
match, it
<BR>will execute the appropriate &lt;commandlist>.&nbsp; More than one
pattern can be
<BR>included per line by separating them with a pipe (|) symbol.

<P>&nbsp;Also, you can use the pattern * to include everything else. Example
script:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --------
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #!/bin/bash
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case $1 in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
cheese | bread | meat)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
echo "food!" ;;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
viper | stingray | transam)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
echo "car!" ;;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
echo "I don't know what it is!" ;;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; esac
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ---------

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is fairly straight forward once you get to grips
with it. It pulls
<BR>in a parameter that you enter on the command line and tries to figure
out
<BR>what it is. If you enter "cheese", "bread" or "meat", our clever script
will
<BR>recognize this as a type of food and will tell you so.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you enter "viper", "stingray" or "transam", it
will recognize it as a
<BR>car! Anything else leaves our poor program clueless.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also a command called select which was stolen
from the korn
<BR>shell. The syntax for this is very similar to case. See if you can
figure it
<BR>out and get it working. HINT - read "man bash".

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many more features of bash, I have not
covered a great
<BR>portion, but that is part of the fun. Now go read the man page (this
text
<BR>should help you make sense out of it!) and see what other nifty little
<BR>features bash has.

<P>&nbsp;I wrote this tutorial using bash version 1.14.7(1). I am about
to upgrade
<BR>to 2.02.01 or whatever the latest is to see what differences that gives
me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get the latest bash version via ftp at prep.ai.mit.edu
or one of its
<BR>mirror sites. This is a good time to brush up your search engine skills
;)
