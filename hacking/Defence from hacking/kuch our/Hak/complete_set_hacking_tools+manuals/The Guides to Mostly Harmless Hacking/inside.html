<P>Hurray for Netmask!

<P>&nbsp;For months many haxors have tried to prove how elite they are
by attempting
<BR>to vandalize Rt66 Internet.&nbsp; However, last week Netmask (netmask@303.org)
<BR>showed those haxors what the ethic of a real hacker is.&nbsp; He found
a security
<BR>flaw in chili.rt66.com -- someone had forgotten to upgrade Secure Shell
on
<BR>that computer after a remote root exploit had been found for it.&nbsp;
Netmask
<BR>could have used his knowledge to sneak in and vandalize chili to prove
how
<BR>31337 he is.&nbsp; However, instead he emailed a Rt66 sysadmin about
the problem.
<BR>As a result, Netmask made new friends who honored him by praising him
in the
<BR>logon message for all Rt66 shell account users.
<BR>&nbsp;Netmask is sysadmin of a web site (<A HREF="http://www.303.org">http://www.303.org</A>)
that is not exactly
<BR>complimentary to me (Carolyn Meinel).&nbsp; Despite that, I now have
to admit he
<BR>is a real hacker.&nbsp; Way to go, Netmask!

<P>Hacker Wargame Recent History

<P>&nbsp;We had a lot of fun with the first Wargame computer,
<BR>cryptotek.happyhacker.org.&nbsp; Spagheti was the first winner.&nbsp;
He made me
<BR>promise not to reveal his true identity, but he sure was fun to play
with!
<BR>&nbsp;When we launched this game, I assumed that any player would want
to hog
<BR>root all to his or herself.&nbsp; I was wrong.&nbsp; At times as many
as three people
<BR>were sharing root, and working together in a friendly way, monitoring
<BR>cryptotek almost around the clock in shifts.
<BR>&nbsp;One day I was sniffing the goings on with the IP-Watcher sniffer
program
<BR>(available from <A HREF="http://www.engarde.com">http://www.engarde.com</A>)
while one fellow was trying to patch
<BR>cryptotek.&nbsp; This fellow was having a hard time, so suddenly someone
else
<BR>su'ed into a root shell and used that power to start typing instructions
on
<BR>how to do it right on the other fellow's screen.
<BR>&nbsp;The most exciting day was May 8, 1998.&nbsp; Someone who had
root on cryptotek
<BR>was taking advantage of it to try to break into the Rt66 domain name
server.
<BR>We later learned he had told the fellow who runs Antionline
<BR>(<A HREF="http://antionline.com">http://antionline.com</A>) that he
planned to tamper with the Rt66 DNS server
<BR>so that anyone pointing their Web browser at <A HREF="http://www.happyhacker.org">http://www.happyhacker.org</A>
<BR>would instead go to his fake Web page that he had set up on cyptotek.
<BR>&nbsp;Since attacking a Rt66 computer was against the rules of the
game, one of
<BR>the other guys with root blew the culprit entirely off cryptotek.
<BR>&nbsp;Moral of this story is that if you play politely, the Uberhackers
who hang
<BR>out on our Wargame will lend you a hand and even share root with you.&nbsp;
Those
<BR>who fight dirty will be history.&nbsp; Those who brag in advance that
they will
<BR>hack the Happy Hacker Web site or mess with Rt66 will probably end
up
<BR>looking like lamers.
<BR>&nbsp;What I really liked about the game is that some Uberhackers proved
that
<BR>they are generous, kind and powerful enemies of computer criminals.&nbsp;
it was
<BR>a real privilege to watch them at play.&nbsp; Of course, these guys
deny being
<BR>Uberhackers, but that only tells me that the best hackers are also
modest.

<P>The Wargame Is Up Again

<P>&nbsp;The Hacker Wargame is up again: koan.happyhacker.org.&nbsp; Actually
it has been
<BR>up since July 1.&nbsp; We wanted to see how long it would take for
people to
<BR>realize it is up.&nbsp; If you were one of the early birds, you would
have
<BR>discovered it when it was a mere newbie challenge.&nbsp; However, no
one broke in
<BR>during those first few days when it was super vulnerable.&nbsp; Now
it has been
<BR>upgraded to an intermediate challenge.
<BR>&nbsp;By intermediate we mean it is easy to hack, but not by exploits
that you
<BR>can download at any hacker websites (that we know of).&nbsp; You will
have to use
<BR>your ingenuity.&nbsp; Yes, it soon will be vulnerable to some remote
exploits, so
<BR>you don't need a shell account on it to be able to seize control.&nbsp;
For more
<BR>details on rules of the game and how to break in, see
<BR><A HREF="http://koan.happyhacker.org/">http://koan.happyhacker.org/</A>.
<BR>&nbsp;Violators of the rules will suddenly discover that the game is
run by
<BR>people who are better hackers than they are -- and who have console
<BR>access:):)&nbsp; Remember the fate of the May 8 hacker!;^)
<BR>&nbsp;Koan's sysadmin is Satori, a recent graduate of an Albuquerque
area high
<BR>school and a sysadmin at Sandia National Laboratories.&nbsp; The hardware,
a 486,
<BR>is on loan from the infamous blips, with ethernet card provided by
the Happy
<BR>Hacker Grand Pooh-bah (me).
<BR>&nbsp;Koan is lots of fun.&nbsp; I just logged into my shell there
and got the message
<BR>"Troubled day for virgins over 16 who are beautiful and wealthy and
live in
<BR>eucalyptus trees."&nbsp; If you think my sense of humor is bad, try
breaking into
<BR>koan and see how Satori messes with your head!

<P>How to Tell When a Wargame Box Goes Online

<P>&nbsp;By now you are probably realizing that if you had spotted koan
the first
<BR>day it was up, it might have been a mere newbie challenge and you would
<BR>probably have root on it by now.&nbsp; Now quit all that moaning about
why didn't
<BR>we let you know right away when it was up! If you want a chance at
a newbie
<BR>box, you have to patiently keep on scanning our network for warboxes.&nbsp;
The
<BR>minute a new one pops up -- have phun!
<BR>&nbsp;How do you know when a computer is available for you to legally
attack?
<BR>Our rule is that anything in the happyhacker.org domain is OK to attack.
<BR>&nbsp;So how do you identify when something is up in the happyhacker.org
domain?
<BR>You need the nslookup program.&nbsp; It is available on almost Unix
computers.
<BR>There are also nslookup programs for Windows, but I'm not going to
tell you
<BR>where to get them because it should be impossible to break into any
of our
<BR>wargame computers using programs that run on Windows.&nbsp; So please
don't waste
<BR>your time hacking this game from Windows.
<BR>&nbsp;Don't have a shell account?&nbsp; You can find ISPs that sell
shell accounts at
<BR><A HREF="http://www.celestin.com/pocia">http://www.celestin.com/pocia</A>.&nbsp;
Netcom provides shell accounts with local
<BR>dialup numbers in most parts of the US.
<BR>&nbsp;If you live where there are no dial-up shell accounts, you can
get one on a
<BR>distant ISP and telnet in.&nbsp; See <A HREF="http://www.happyhacker.org">http://www.happyhacker.org</A>
for more
<BR>instructions.&nbsp; Don't email me about how to get a shell account,
you can find
<BR>lots of answers to your questions in recent Digests and the GTMHHs
on shell
<BR>accounts.
<BR>&nbsp;Or -- best of all -- run some form of Unix on your home computer.&nbsp;
If you
<BR>are a newbie, probably the easiest to install is Red Hat Linux
<BR>(<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com">http://www.redhat.com</A>).&nbsp;
Most powerful, IMHO, is Slackware Linux.&nbsp; Most
<BR>secure is, in the experience of our Wargame, either OpenBSD or FreeBSD.
<BR>Most compatible is, IMHO, Debian Linux (<A HREF="http://www.debian.com">http://www.debian.com</A>).&nbsp;
If you have
<BR>a Power PC, check out the Apple Web site for Mach 10, a Unix for Macs
that
<BR>Hacker Wargame director Mark Schmitz swears by.
<BR>&nbsp;Assuming you have a shell account (an account on a Unix computer
that
<BR>allows you to give Unix commands), here's how to see whatever is in
the
<BR>Happy Hacker domain (stuff after the ">"s are the commands you will
give):

<P>~ > nslookup
<BR>Default Server:&nbsp; mack.rt66.com
<BR>Address:&nbsp; 198.59.999.1

<P>> ls happyhacker.org
<BR>[mack.rt66.com]
<BR>&nbsp;happyhacker.org.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
server = mack.rt66.com
<BR>&nbsp;happyhacker.org.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
server = chili.rt66.com
<BR>&nbsp;fantasia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
198.59.118.50
<BR>&nbsp;sparc1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
198.59.118.52
<BR>&nbsp;koan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
198.59.118.51
<BR>&nbsp;mail&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
198.59.118.53

<P>&nbsp;The computers mack and chili are NOT available for hacking.&nbsp;
They come
<BR>after the word "server".&nbsp; That just means they carry information
about what
<BR>computers are in the Happy Hacker domain.&nbsp; Only the computers
which have
<BR>numbers after them are in the Happy Hacker domain.
<BR>&nbsp;Now before you get all excited and think we have four computers
available
<BR>to try to break into, there is one more step you need to take.&nbsp;
These are
<BR>merely IP addresses we have assigned.&nbsp; There may not be a live
computer
<BR>behind each of these numbers.&nbsp; Your next step is to ping these
numbers to
<BR>see if anything answers back.&nbsp; In your shell account, or in Win
95 or Win 98
<BR>MS-DOS while online, give the command:

<P>~ > ping 198.59.118.52
<BR>PING 198.59.118.52 (198.59.118.52): 56 data bytes
<BR>ping: sendto: Host is down

<P>&nbsp;This is how ping works on koan.&nbsp; On MS-DOS you may get:

<P>C:\WINDOWS>ping 198.59.118.52

<P>Pinging 198.59.118.52 with 32 bytes of data:

<P>Request timed out.

<P>What Not to Attack

<P>&nbsp;You probably figured out that our ISP, Rt66.com, is NOT OK to
attack.&nbsp; If
<BR>you try to break into Rt66 you are breaking the law.
<BR>&nbsp;The Happy Hacker website also is not OK to attack.&nbsp; Despite
its name, it is
<BR>NOT in the Happy Hacker domain.&nbsp; Here's an easy way you can tell.

<P>~ > ftp www.happyhacker.org
<BR>Connected to zlliks.505.org.
<BR>220 zlliks FTP server (Version 5.60) ready.

<P>&nbsp;As you can see, ftp discovers that www.happyhacker.org is on
<BR>zlliks.505.org, which is NOT a happyhacker.org computer.&nbsp; All
505.org
<BR>computers belong to the 505 gang.&nbsp; While they are kind enough
to volunteer
<BR>lots of help for Happy Hacker, they are really grouchy about people
trying
<BR>to break into their computers.&nbsp; I have gotten ever so many anguished
emails
<BR>from people who tried to break into zlliks.505.org and lost their Internet
<BR>accounts.&nbsp; This is because minor attacks, really lame stuff like
phf
<BR>attacks, cause an automatic program to email the ISP from which the
attack
<BR>came alerting its sysadmins that someone tried to break in, and sends
a log
<BR>of the attack.&nbsp; From this log the ISP is able to tell who was
the culprit
<BR>and will often kick him or her off.
<BR>&nbsp;People who try more sophisticated illegal attacks get even more
interesting
<BR>responses.&nbsp; I suggest you NOT experiment with riling up 505.
<BR>&nbsp;Just to be sure you don't accidentally attack a 505 gang computer,
here is
<BR>how to tell which belong to them:

<P>~ > nslookup
<BR>Default Server:&nbsp; mack.rt66.com
<BR>Address:&nbsp; 198.59.162.1

<P>> ls 505.org
<BR>[mack.rt66.com]
<BR>&nbsp;505.org.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
server = mack.rt66.com
<BR>&nbsp;505.org.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
server = chili.rt66.com
<BR>&nbsp;505.org.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
198.59.118.49
<BR>&nbsp;knight&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
198.59.118.62
<BR>&nbsp;zlliks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
198.59.118.49

<P>Cryptik will Be Back

<P>&nbsp;Those of you who miss Cryptik and his Wargame box,
<BR>cryptotek.happyhacker.org, will be glad to hear he will soon be back
in the
<BR>game.&nbsp; He recently moved from Albuquerque to Sunnyvale where he
has been
<BR>busy finishing high school a year early, taking a college course in
advanced
<BR>shell programming, and also working in a place that builds motherboards.
<BR>Nevertheless he has taken the time to replace the 486 that used to
host
<BR>cryptotek.happyhacker.org with -- an ULTRASPARC2!&nbsp; We expect this
new,
<BR>muscular version of cryptotek to swagger back into the Wargame soon.&nbsp;
Way to
<BR>go, Cryptik!

<P>Help, I'm a Newbie, Teach Me Step by Step How to Hack

<P>&nbsp;I get email asking me this all the time.&nbsp; Here's what I tell
all these
<BR>guys.&nbsp; Buy "The Happy Hacker" book.&nbsp; It is NOT a printed
version of the
<BR>GTMHHs.&nbsp; It is all new writing, and has lots of screen shots.&nbsp;
It takes you
<BR>step by step, chapter by chapter, all the way from being a pure beginner
to
<BR>where you can do some lots of really fun stuff such as playing the
hacker
<BR>wargame.&nbsp; In fact, three of the editors of The Happy Hacker book
are helping
<BR>run the Hacker Wargame.&nbsp; When you get good enough to master everything
in
<BR>the book, it has lots of URLs to point you to places where you can
begin
<BR>advanced study and even tells how to win a mentor who will help you
make it
<BR>to the top if you work hard and buy him or her lots of pizza and chocolate
<BR>covered strawberries and mint condition Crow comic books.&nbsp; Spagheti
is
<BR>especially partial to Crow comics.
<BR>&nbsp;How do you get "The Happy Hacker"?&nbsp; I've gotten a number
of complaints
<BR>about it being hard to get.&nbsp; Here are the best I've found:

<P>1) Cheap: get it from your local bookstore for $29.95 plus any local
sales
<BR>tax.&nbsp; They probably won't have it on their shelf, but can usually
order it.
<BR>Barnes and Noble has it in their warehouse.&nbsp; If your local bookstore
doesn't
<BR>have it, tell them they can get it from American Eagle, 800-719-4957
<BR>(outside the US dial US country code plus 520-367-1621).
<BR>2) Cheapest: get together with some friends and talk American Eagle
<BR>(800-719-4957) into selling a bunch of the books to you wholesale.
<BR>3) Buy it with a credit card on the Web at either http://www.amazon.com
or
<BR>http://www.infowar.com.&nbsp; The Infowar site also sells a lot of
rare computer
<BR>security books.
<BR>4) Fastest: In the US, buy it directly from me (Carolyn Meinel) by
sending a
<BR>check for $34.95 (That's $29.95 plus $5 shipping and handling).&nbsp;
This gets
<BR>it to you by 2nd day priority US mail.&nbsp; By contract I'm not allowed
to sell
<BR>it for less than other folks such as Infowar, which also charges $34.95
for
<BR>shipment by priority mail.&nbsp; But I have the book in stock all the
time, and
<BR>sometimes Infowar runs out.
<BR>5) Buy it directly over the phone with a credit card at American Eagle,
<BR>800-719-4957 (outside the US dial US country code plus 520-367-1621).
<BR>&nbsp;If you have ordered the Happy Hacker book and not gotten it after
several
<BR>weeks, please let me know.&nbsp; I can help find the problem faster
if you tell
<BR>me who you bought the book from and where and when your check was deposited.
<BR>Important note: if you made the check out to "Happy Hacker," guess
what,
<BR>more than one person has sold it under that name.&nbsp; Be sure to
tell me the
<BR>mail or email address to which you sent your money.
<BR>&nbsp;We have not had any problems with American Eagle, Amazon.com
or
<BR>Infowar.com.&nbsp; They are all well established companies with good
reputations.

<P>Hacking Lessons

<P>&nbsp;Want someone to hold your hand on IRC while you learn to hack?&nbsp;
You are out
<BR>of luck.&nbsp; However, if you want to learn Unix well enough so you
can have a
<BR>chance of winning the Hacker Wargame, email Joshua Fritsch
<BR>&lt;<A HREF="mailto:derr@idworld.net">derr@idworld.net</A>> and he
will notify you of his next IRC Unix lesson.

<P>What's in a Name?

<P>&nbsp;Speaking of more than one person getting people to write out checks
to
<BR>Happy Hacker and depositing them in their personal checking accounts
--
<BR>guess what, this name isn't trademarked.&nbsp; Anyone can call themselves
Happy
<BR>Hacker.&nbsp; The only way you can tell us from the others is that
we have a
<BR>better sense of humor and own happyhacker.org.
<BR>&nbsp;For example, if you go to http://www.happyhacker.com, you will
discover
<BR>they call themselves "HappyHacker, Inc."&nbsp; Their site, last time
I visited,
<BR>had nothing to do with either happy or hacking, but sure had an X-rated
<BR>simulation of Bill Clinton and Monica doing, um, er, something.&nbsp;
We have
<BR>nothing to do with those guys!
<BR>&nbsp;A fellow named Brian Martin, who also uses the handles jericho,
DisordeR,
<BR>Damien Sorder and dis, owns the domain name <A HREF="http://www.happy-hacker.org">happy-hacker.org</A>.&nbsp;
He also has
<BR>no role in our Happy Hacker.
<BR>&nbsp;However, when he isn't flaming me he often asks me to please
let him be an
<BR>editor of my upcoming GTMHHs.&nbsp; I actually kind of like Brian when
I'm not
<BR>flaming him, and a long time ago he helped with two of the GTMHHs.
Recently
<BR>he turned up on one of Josh Fritsch's Unix lessons on IRC and was quite
<BR>helpful.&nbsp; So who knows, Brian might someday become a Happy Hacker
regular
<BR>volunteer.&nbsp; But he isn't one yet:)

<P>&nbsp;That's all for now.&nbsp; Have fun and hack happy!&nbsp; Just
don't rile 505, OK?
