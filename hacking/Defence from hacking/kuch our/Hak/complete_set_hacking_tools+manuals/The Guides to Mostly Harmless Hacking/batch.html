Hacking with Win95/NT:  Batch File Programming</B>

____________________________________________________________



<B>by KeyDet89</B>



I figured that, after all of the Happy Hacker Digests

and Guides To (mostly) Harmless Hacking that have

dealt with shell programming, something for Win95 and

NT needed to be addressed.



***************************************************

Newbie Note:  A good resource for batch files is to go to

you local library and look up back issues of PC Magazine.

The older editions, even those published after Win95 came

out, list several useful batch files that you can use

or modify for your own use.  WindowsNT Magazine has had 

several good articles on scripting languages for NT.



Other excellent sources of information include books from

the library and used bookstores.



Also, visit the alt.msdos.batch newsgroup.  If you can't

access newsgroups from your ISP, use your browser to

visit DejaNews at <A HREF="http://www.dejanews.com">http://www.dejanews.com</A>.  Or visit

any of the sites listed at the end of this file.

***************************************************



Let's get started.  First, keep in mind that batch files 

are just series of programs that you would like executed.

The files are made up of commands that already reside on

your machine.  If you have several commands that type over

and over, each with specific switches and parameters, you 

may want to put them into a batch file.  Batch files can

also be used the way aliases are on Un*x...written properly,

you can launch a program from the command line without 

having to type it out each time.



A word about editors:  You already have two suitable text 

editors on your computer...DOS edit, and Notepad.  Edit

is fairly simple to use, but you may not be used to it.  

Notepad is also easy to use, just remember to save your files

with the correct ".bat" extension so that they will be 

recognized as batch files by the command processor.



***************************************************

Newbie Note:  Most of the commands that you will want

to run from batch files will be command line programs.

Check out your windows\command directory to see what

is available.  Don't hesitate to look for DOS or Win95

command line programs on the Internet.

***************************************************



STEP 1 -- "Hello, World"

The first program we will write is the obligatory "Hello World"

program that accompanies every programming language.  Simply 

save a file called "hello.bat" with the following text:



echo Hello, World!



Now, if you type "hello" at the prompt, you will see the "echo"

line printed at the prompt, then the line "Hello, World!" on the

line below it.  To suppress the commands at the prompt, add the

line:



@echo off



as the first line of the file.  Now rerun the file.



STEP 2 -- Arguments

Now, let's personalize our program a bit.  Change the second line

to:



echo Hello, %1



and run the program by typing:



c:\&gt;hello Johnny



Now we've added arguments, as denoted by the "%1".  This refers to

the first argument that is sent to the file.  We can send multiple

arguments.  To demonstrate, open a file called "args.bat" and type

in the following lines:



@echo off

echo ARGS: %1 %2 %3 %4

echo REV: %4 %3 %2 %1

echo MIXED: %2 %1 %4 %3



Now run the file with at least two arguments (you can use more and

examine the output):



c:\&gt;args hello steve dog rain



STEP 3 -- Redirection

When programming in most languages, there are three references that

you need to be aware of:  standard input (STDIN - usually the 

keyboard), standard output (STDOUT - the screen), and standard

error (STDERR - also the screen).  However, you may not want the 

output to go to the screen, you may want it stored in a file.  Well,

we can do this fairly easily with something called redirection.



How does this work?  Well, when you type in something like:



c:\&gt;attrib /?



to find out what the attrib (attribute) command does, and how

it is used, you see a lot of information on the screen.  Try doing

the same thing with the "net" command under Win95, and the info

seems to disappear off the screen!  So to send the output of the 

command to a file, simply add the greater-than sign and a file

name to the command:



c:\&gt;net /? &gt; net.txt



If you want to add or append information to an already existing

file, use the double-greater-than symbol:



c:\&gt;net view /? &gt;&gt; net.txt



****************************************************

Cool Trick To Try:  I won't be covering HTML programming here,

but here is something to try.  There are basic commands that

every web page has...these are the tags that are that are used

to designate the header, title, change colors or fonts, etc.

Write a batch file that takes the output of series of commands,

such as "net", "net view", "net use", "net user", and "net time"

and puts them in an HTML file.  That way, you can post it on

the web.  You may even go so far as to include links to examples,

etc.

****************************************************



STEP 4 -- Autoexec.bat

Now is a good time for a word on the King of All Batch Files,

the autoexec.bat file.  This is the file that is used by DOS

at boot up, and exists for DOS and Win95 (Win3.1 runs on top of

DOS, and is called from the autoexec.bat file).  Use the 

autoexec.bat file "to set the characteristics of your devices, 

customize the information that MS-DOS displays, and start 

memory-resident programs and other applications" (from the

MS-DOS User Guide).  Really?  Well, given that, you can do all

sorts of interesting things with this file...or any other batch

file.



Note on NT:  NT does not use the autoexec.bat file, but there

is a registry key that when set, will enable the parsing of 

the autoexec.bat file, reportedly for environment variables.

Gee, I wonder what else it will do...



*****************************************************

Evil Genius Tip:  Take a look at the prompt command by typing:



c:\&gt;prompt /?



Play around with different settings.  Typing the command to 

change the prompt at the current command prompt will change 

it for that session...adding the command to the autoexec.bat

file will change if for all sessions.

*****************************************************



STEP 5 -- Aliases

You'll notice that when you type:



c:\&gt;notepad somefile.txt



Notepad opens with the file, and in the DOS window, you get

you command prompt back.  So if you want a quick way to open

the text files, create a small batch file called "np.bat", with

the lines:



@echo off

notepad %1 



Now all you have to do is type "np" and the file name. 



****************************************************

Evil Genius Trick:  Here's a handy little way to create a

mini-syslog daemon of your very own...or someone elses.

Create a file called "file.log", or whatever, on the

target computer, in the Windows directory.  



HINT:  Investigate the "attrib" command, paying particular

attention to the "h" option.



Now, create a batch file that will make entries to file.log.

You might want to have something printed, or just the file

that was opened.

Next, click Start -&gt; Help, and type in "associating" and 

display the help on "file types with programs".  Change 

the associations for ".txt" files to point to your batch

file, and make sure that the last line reads:



notepad %1



If your friend uses Microsoft Word a lot, make the 

appropriate changes there, too.

**************************************************** 



****************************************************

Neat Trick Tip:  If you like the Un*x commands, but don't

want to fool with downloading them, write you own.  Create

a batch file called "ls.bat" and use the "dir" commands to

customize the display.  Start with:



@echo off

dir %1



Make sure to see what switches are available for the dir 

command...

****************************************************



STEP 6 -- Information Gathering

There are several commands that can be used to gather

information, especially on a networked computer.  These 

commands can be used to gather information for diagnostic

purposes, as well as being used for other insidious 

purposes (no Evil Genius Tips here, I'll leave it up to

your imagination).  Start by running the following commands

on your machine while connected to a network or to the

Internet:



nbtstat -c

nbtstat -n

netstat -an

net user (NT only)

net use/config/time/view

arp -a



When you begin to see the type of information that is

available, tailor the commands to your needs, and put

them in a batch file, redirecting the output to a log file

of some sort.



STEP 7 -- More Stuff

I have gathered together some sites that provide more

detailed information on batch file programming.  These sources

range all the way from examples to tutorials to post-graduate

theses...so take a look...

Microsoft-only version Number 3

Hacking with Win95/NT:  Batch File Programming
____________________________________________________________

by Nezah

        We've learned what a batch file is and how to write them. Now it's
time to get all that batch files can bring us. Lets start.

        1.- The IF command
        It's easy to find out what it is for. The if command evaluates an
a condition and, in case of true result, it executes a command. There are
three ways to use IF. The different sintax are these:
        IF [NOT] EXIST file command
        IF [NOT] string1==string2 command
        IF [NOT] ERRORLEVEL number command
        Where command is the order (only one) you want to execute. The
NOT word is optional, and it makes the condition inverese. Lets see one
by one.

        **IF [NOT] EXIST file command.
        What it does is to find out if there is or not a file. If the file
exist (or not, if the NOT word is typed) then the command is executed.
Otherwise, the command is ignored.

=========================================================
TIP: Maybe you don't want to verify a file, but a drive or a directory. In
        this case, you have to look for the "file" NULL, that is present in
        any directory. For example, if you want to verify the c:\nezah
        directory, type this:
                IF EXIST C:\NEZAH\NULL command
        To test if a disquette is in, type this:
                IF EXIST A:\NULL command
=========================================================

        **IF [NOT] string1==string2 command
        Compares the two strings string1 and string2. In case that every
character is equal in both (case sensitive and blank spaces ignored), the
command is executed.
        It is useful to play with the parameters (read GTmHH Micro$oft 2).
Note now that, when a parameter call is found (for example, %1), DOS replaces
it for the text of the parameter, no matter where it is. For example, if %1
is Happy, when DOS finds:
                00%100
        replaces it for:
                00Happy00
        The same with   "%1"    ---&gt    "Happy"
                        " %1 "  ---&gt    " Happy "

============================================================================
NOTE: If a parameter does not exist, DOS replaces it with a blank space or
        just with nothing (in W95 OSR2 is nothing). To avoid lose control of
        the program, is useful to put every string into quotes. So, for example,
        if you want to see if a parameter is present, type:
                IF "%1"==" " command    ---&gt    DOS 6.x
                IF "%1"=="" command     ---&gt    In W95 is empty string ""
        In any other cases, quotes are not needed and strings are compared
        normally.
=======================================================

        **IF [NOT] ERRORLEVEL number command
        This evaluates the last errorlevel number present. Errorlevels are
generated by programs to inform about the way they finished their execution.
For example, format returns errorlevel 3 when is Ctrl-C is pressed, and
errorlevel 0 when it finish normally. Not all the programs return errorlevels,
and errorlevels are lost when another program is runned.
        This is the most useful feature of IF command. We'll explain it later,
with the CHOICE command.

        2.- Labels and GOTO command.
        Labels are used to identify a line of the batch file. The way to
put a label inside a .bat progam is simply to put : before the label name.
For example, to create the "example" label, do this:
                :example
        And that's all.
        Labels get useful when you use the order GOTO. GOTO simply goes to
the labeled line you want. For example, to go to the :example label just type:
                GOTO :example 
        That makes the execution of the .bat file continue above that line,
no matter if it was far below the current line or before it.

======================================================
NOTE: The label does not defines a function (like in programming languajes).
        It makes the execution continue below the :label line.
        When, in normal execution, a :label line is found, it is ignored. The
        only use of lables is with the order GOTO.
======================================================

======================================================
TIP: You can create a :end label at the end of the file, so that, whenever
        you want to finish the program, you just have to type "GOTO :end". 
======================================================

======================================================
TIP: Remember that, in the IF sentence, only was allowed one command.
        This sucks, I know. But now, you can create a label and make this
        only one command be GOTO :label. Then, in this :label you can have
        as many commands as you want, and finish the execution or return to
        the program point you wanted with :end or :new_label
======================================================

        3.- CHOICE
        Now we're ready to get the maximum power from the choice command.
We saw before that errorlevels are some kind'a number that programs returned
and so on. That was not very useful, I know, but for the choice program.
        The choice program takes a letter from the keyboard and returns an
errorlevel in consecuence of the key pressed. The sintax is:
                CHOICE [text] [/C[:]keys] [/S] [/N] [/T[:]key,secs]

        Text is no more than the text to show when choice is runned.
        /C:keys Defines the possibles keys to be pressed. If no option is
                present, Y/N are the keys. For example:
                        CHOICE /C:ABCD
                Defines A,B,C,D as possible keys.
                If you press a not defined key, you'll hear a beep and will
                continue as if nothing was pressed.
        /S  Makes CHOICE case sensitive. By default, Z is equal to z for
                choice. With /S flag present, Z and z are different.
        /N  Choice shows the possible keys into brackets when is called.
                With the /N flag present, it does not, so that only the text
                you typed (if so) is shown.
        /T:key,secs  defines a key that is taken as default when secs seconds
                are passed. For example:
                        CHOICE  Chose drive /C:AC /T:C,5
                Shows the message "Chose drive [A,C]" (without quotes) and,
                if no key pressed, passed 5 seconds, choses C.

        **Way it works
        Now we know how to make the CHOICE sentence. Lets see what happens
when CHOICE runs. It returns an errorlevel number corresponding to the key
position in the /C flag. What???. Well, lets se an example:

                CHOICE /C:ABCD
                          |||L____&gt    D gives errorlevel 5
                          ||L_____&gt    C gives errorlevel 4
                          |L______&gt    B gives errorlevel 3
                          L_______&gt    A gives errorlevel 1

        Now you see that the errorlevel number depends on nothing but the
position of the key that you gave to CHOICE. That is, when you type
                CHOICE /C:2567
        Pressing 2, CHOICE will give us errorlevel 1, 5 will give
errorlevel 2, 6 errorlevel 3 and 7 errorlevel 4.

        Lets see now what to do with errorlevel. If you remember the IF
section, there was an:
                IF [NOT] ERRORLEVEL number command
        This evaluates the current errorlevel number. If condition is true
the command is executed.

===================================================
IMPORTANT NOTE: The evaluation of an errorlevel is true when the current
        errorlevel is equal OR HIGHER than the number compared. That means
        that, in:
                IF ERRORLEVEL 3 GOTO :label
        The condition is true for errorlevel 3, 4, 5... and every errorlevel
        equal or greater than 3.
===================================================

        To clarify this, read the next example.

                @ECHO OFF
                ECHO.
                ECHO 1.- Runs Windoze 3.11
                ECHO 2.- Runs Dosshell
                ECHO 3.- Runs Quake
                ECHO X.- Exit program
                ECHO.
                CHOICE "Choose your option " /C:123x /N
                IF ERRORLEVEL 4 GOTO end
                IF ERRORLEVEL 3 c:\quake\quake -listen 16
                IF ERRORLEVEL 2 dosshell
                IF ERRORLEVEL 1 win
                :end

        This is a complete batch program. Lets analyze it.
        First line turns ECHO off: the command lines inside the program will
not be shown.
        Second line prints an empty line (like pressing RETURN).
        Lines 3 to 7 prints the messages for the program.
        Line 8 is choice. This will show you only the text (because of the
/N flag) and will only allow you to press 1,2,3,4 or x key. It is case
unsensitive (no /S flag given). Note that the text is into quotes. This is
to make CHOICE respect the blank space at the end. Quotes will not be shown,
and are not required. If you unuse quotes, CHOICE will not print the blank
spaces of the begining or the end of the text.
        Lines 9 to 12 evaluates the errorlevel. Note that:
                Only numbers are evaluated. No X letter is writen.
                It is in decreasing order. That is because the evaluation is
                        true if the current errorlevel is equal or higher. So
                        if I start with errorlevel 1, and errorlevel 4 (an
                        X) is pressed, I will execute the command anyway.
                The execution of the batch file continues after the program
                        you called is runned. So, if the program returns
                        errorlevels, you may get an error. Commands CLS,
                        CD and DIR doesn't reset the current errorlevel, and
                        other DOS commands returns their own errorlevels. So,
                        when you call a DOS order, is better to make a GOTO
                        anyway, to avoid stupid errors.
                In the first IF ERRORLEVEL... the goto order does not have
                        : before the label name. This is because they are
                        not required in the goto call.
        Line 13 is the label end. When you call it, the programs finish.

        4.- The command FOR
        Now we'll se how to make a batch file smaller. The for order is not
very useful, but sometimes is exactly what you need. So lets see it.
        The FOR command makes a "variable" change it's value between the
posibilities you gave it, and executes a command every time it changes. The
sintax is that:
                FOR %%A IN (list of values) DO command
        Here %%A is the name of the variable. (list of values) is just
the list of values (easy, uh?) between which will change the variable %%A.
The different values are separed by a blank space, and are only considered
as strings.

=======================================================
Programes NOTE: The variables are not true variables. They are only valid
        in the FOR command, and will lose any meaning after FOR is finished.
=======================================================

        Lets see an example to explain it:

                FOR %%B IN (Hello Happy Hacker) DO ECHO %%B

        This will make the variable %%B change it's value. First time will
be Hello. Second time Happy, and third Hacker. Every time the %%B value is
changed, the command after the DO word (ECHO %%B in our example) is executed.
So this line in a batch file will print in our screns:

                Hello Happy Hacker

        There is something more to say about FOR. I have never tried it, but
I read that: when you give FOR a wildcard, it will take care to substitute it
for every existing filename that fits the wildcard. That is that, if you have
                FOR %%A in (AUTO*.BAT) DO copy %%A c:\backup
the copy command will recive every time complete file names and no wildcards.
This will execute, for example:
                copy AUTOEXEC.BAT c:\backup
                copy AUTODOS.BAT c:\backup
                copy AUTODOS7.BAT c:\backup
        And not something like:
                copy AUTO*.BAT c:\backup.
        This may be useful with programs with no wildcards alowed, like the
expand command, that expand a compressed file.

        5.- Other orders.
        **REM and the commets.
        To comment a complete line, you should use REM at the begining of it.
You can also use : before tha line. But this will make the line a label, I
conseder this quite rough. It's up to you.

========================================================
Newbie note: A comment is something ignored in the execution of the program.
        Every programming language has at least one way to make comments.
        This is extremely useful to make your program easier to read to other
        people and to yourself in future.
========================================================

        **CALL
        When you call an .exe of a .com or a DOS command inside a batch file,
after the execution of this program, the .bat file will continue at the point
it was before. But this is not this way when you call a .bat file. I you run
another .bat file inside another, the second one will take control and won't
return it after is finished. To run a .bat file inside another and after
continue the program that called the second, we have to use the order CALL.
That's what CALL does: execute a .bat file and return to ours after it is
finished.

        **PAUSE
        PAUSE is used to stop the execution till a key is pressed. It gives
a message ("Pulse una tecla para continuar" in Spain), and there is no way
to change it. I you want to insert you own message, the best way is to
redirect the text of pause to NULL (NULL is some kind'a black hole). This
will make pause with no message, and you can now insert yours:
                ECHO This is my message. Press a key.
                PAUSE &gt NULL
        Another way to do this is with the CHOICE order, but this limits
the valid keys to be pressed.

        **SHIFT
        If you notice, you can only use 9 parameters: from %1 to %9. In most
of cases this it more than enough. But, if you need to use more than 9
parameters in your program, you can use the order SHIFT. SHIFT makes the
parameters lose their current value and will give them the value of the next
numbered parameters. Quite confusing, I know. Lets see it.
        If you give the order SHIFT, %1 lose it's value and, from now, has
second parameter as content. The same with %2, that now refers to the third
parameter... and so on till the %9 parameter. Now, the %9 values the 10th
parameter, that was unaccesible before.
        You can execute SHIFT as many times as you want. But note that the
maximun DOS order width is 255 characters, so you don't make a program that
needs 50 parameters because you won't be able to type all of them.

        Well, that's all I know about batch files. I hope you've enjoyed it
and excuse my spelling, my grammar... my English in general.
