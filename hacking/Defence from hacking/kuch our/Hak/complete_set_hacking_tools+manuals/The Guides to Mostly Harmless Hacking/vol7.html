<p>Vol. 7 No. 1

<p><b><font size=+1>Introduction to Hacker Wargaming</font></b>

<br>____________________________________________________________

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we began running the Hacker Wargame in

March 1988, so far (Oct. 1998)

<br>we have just two winners (blips and spagheti -- GALF doesn't count

because

<br>they committed a felony to get in) -- and lots of questions about how

to

<br>become a winner. "Please explain keystroke by keystroke," people ask

again

<br>and again.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry, I can't do that for you.&nbsp; The

problem is, when we made the Wargame

<br>easy to win, certain script kiddies came in and repeatedly erased key

parts

<br>of the operating system of the Wargame computer -- which is a pain

to fix.

<br>So we decided to set up the Wargame so it was harder to use script

kiddie

<br>programs.&nbsp; The result, sad to say, was that winners became rare.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's pretty boring when only two people are

able to not just break into but

<br>maintain control of one of our Wargame computers.&nbsp; (You aren't

a winner

<br>unless you can maintain control.) So this Wargaming series is intended

to

<br>teach you, the aspiring Uberhacker, how to rise above the level of

the

<br>script kiddie.&nbsp; If this series is successful, you will learn how

hackers

<br>such as blips and spagheti have become computer security experts instead

of

<br>mere script kiddies.&nbsp; You will have the opportunity to follow

in their

<br>footsteps by learning how to discover new computer vulnerabilities,

and

<br>learning how to fix them yourself, without being told "keystroke by

keystroke."

<p>************************************************************

<br>In this GTMHH you will learn:

<p>* What are script kiddies and why they are lame

<br>* Why setting up your own LAN (local area network) is the best way

to become

<br>an Uberhacker

<br>* What kind of hardware you will need

<br>* How to get hardware cheap

<br>* How to get operating system software cheap

<p><b><font size=+1>What Are Script Kiddies, and Why they Are Lame</font></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Want to know exactly what a script kiddie is?

The Web site

<br><a href="http://www.antionline.com">http://www.antionline.com</a> carries

some of the best news about computer

<br>break-ins.&nbsp; Its owner, John Vranesevich &lt;<a href="mailto:jp@antionline.com">jp@antionline.com</a>>

is a

<br>self-described hacker, and has interviewed and listened to thousands

of

<br>hackers. With his permission, here we reprint his recent editorial

"Facing

<br>the Age of the Script Kiddies"

<br>&nbsp;

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past, a hacker was an individual

who literally had to spend&nbsp; years

<br>to learn the inner workings of computer technology,&nbsp; programming,

and

<br>hardware. Only then could he begin to explore&nbsp; possible vulnerabilities,

and

<br>develop, for himself, ways to&nbsp; exploit those vulnerabilities,

and more

<br>importantly, ways to patch&nbsp; them. Through out these years of learning,

the

<br>hacker would&nbsp; develop a certain respect for the technology that

he was

<br>studying,&nbsp; and a certain level of maturity would inherently develop

as well.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in present day society, with point

and click utilities&nbsp; abound, a

<br>younger, less mature, less knowledgeable, and less respectful, generation

of "hackers" have come to life. Individuals&nbsp; who haven't had to go

through the years of learning, and study.&nbsp; Individuals, who because

of the lack of experiencing this&nbsp; "learning process" have not developed

the traits which once went&nbsp; hand in hand with the persona of

<br>"hacker". Kids who are at that&nbsp; age, where they have very little

self

<br>respect, and even less&nbsp; respect for others. Kids who are insecure,

and have

<br>a strong&nbsp; desire to feel that sense of belonging. The sense of

being

<br>accepted as part of a group, and respected among their peers. The&nbsp;

same

<br>emotional state which once led inner city youth to gangs, is&nbsp;

now leading

<br>them to "hacking". Individuals who feel the ultimate&nbsp; sense of

power in

<br>"hacking a webpage". Their words being read by&nbsp; thousands of others.

Their

<br>ability to control something. The&nbsp; technology is not a love, but

a tool to

<br>accomplish something much&nbsp; more in their eyes. A tool that can

be used to

<br>gain them&nbsp; acceptance, a feeling of empowerment, belonging, and

control. A

<br>tool to allow them to escape the ridicule of the kids on the bus,&nbsp;

or the

<br>back of their parent's hand.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, and I can hear people screaming

"stereotyping" right&nbsp; now. Well, call

<br>it what you may. I've talked to literally&nbsp; thousands of these

so called

<br>"hackers" over the past 5 or 6 years.&nbsp; You'd be surprised at how

clear of a

<br>mold many of them come from.&nbsp; I am really sick of hearing "we

hacked that

<br>page to get a message&nbsp; out". Perhaps, in some very, very, rare

cases, that

<br>is true. But,&nbsp; I submit to you, the vast majority of time a hack

is done

<br>first,&nbsp; and a political agenda is developed after hand to help

rationalize

<br>the crime. On top of that, one hardly has to "hack a webpage" to&nbsp;

get their

<br>point of view told.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the wonder of the Internet. Everyone

is an equal.&nbsp; Everyone has the

<br>opportunity to post their views, and share their&nbsp; thoughts. Once

again,

<br>these so called "hackers" avoid the&nbsp; developmental process. They

don't want

<br>to spend the time and&nbsp; energy necessary to create a successful

website of

<br>their own. So,&nbsp; they maliciously exploit the work of others that

have. I'm

<br>19&nbsp; years old right now. I know what it is like being upset about

something, and feeling that there's no way to share that with&nbsp; others.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's one of the reasons that I made AntiOnline.

It's my&nbsp; forum. My way of

<br>expressing my views on things. To think of me, a&nbsp; 19 year old

college drop

<br>out. Yet, my&nbsp; work is viewed millions&nbsp; of times every month.

That, my little

<br>"hacker" friends, is power.&nbsp; That is what the Internet is about.

That's why

<br>it works. That's&nbsp; why it's growing.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless you change your ways soon, you

will never be truly&nbsp; experiencing

<br>the wonder that technology is. To truly love&nbsp; technology, love

how it is

<br>changing our society, bringing mankind&nbsp; together in a way never

before

<br>experienced in the history of the&nbsp; human race. You'll never truly

be

<br>experiencing the very thing that&nbsp; you feel you have ultimate control

over. A

<br>true irony indeed.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, as with all things, there

is hope. There are&nbsp; people out their

<br>hanging on tightly to the ways of old, and the&nbsp; true hacker identity.

There

<br>are groups like L0pht, the&nbsp; distributed.net bovine group, and

the kids down

<br>at your local high&nbsp; school learning visual basic.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those are the true hackers. A desire

to learn, a desire to&nbsp; be the first

<br>to discover something new. A true hacker mentality is&nbsp; something

that

<br>shouldn't be thought of as a dark, mischievous&nbsp; thing, but perhaps,

more

<br>like that of a scientist. Study, learn,&nbsp; experiment, and share

what you've

<br>found with others......

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Yours In CyberSpace,

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><br><b><font size=+1>Why Setting up your own LAN Is the Best Way to

become an Uberhacker</font></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK, so you want to become more than a script

kiddie?&nbsp; So do I.&nbsp; Here's what

<br>the best hackers I know say was their route to the top: wargaming on

their

<br>own and friends' LANs (local area networks).&nbsp; This is a study

technique used

<br>by the kind of people who can slide through computer systems like ghosts

<br>wafting through walls.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait! Wait!" some of you are saying.&nbsp;

"I thought hackers learn by

<br>illegally breaking into the computers of strangers!" True, plenty of

people

<br>you meet on hacker mailing lists and on IRC make out like they are

computer

<br>security experts by day and computer criminals by night.&nbsp; There

even are

<br>people who have been convicted of computer crimes who work as security

<br>experts.&nbsp; These guys probably are telling you the truth when they

say they

<br>were foolish enough to learn their trade by committing crime.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, crime often leads to prison, and

prison is no fun.&nbsp; Guess what

<br>happens when bad breath cellmate "Bubba" decides you're cute?&nbsp;

Guess what

<br>happens when your name is Kevin Mitnik and Hollywood makes a movie

full of

<br>lies about you? Besides, when you break into a computer illegally,

you miss

<br>out on the most fun part, which is being the guy who is fighting back!

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So ... are you ready to learn about breaking

into and defending computers

<br>the way the Uberhackers do it? Ready to learn how to run your own hacker

<br>wargames?

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can get started with newbie wargaming

by reading the GTMHHs on "How to

<br>Break into Windows 95 from the Internet."&nbsp; (See <a href="http://www.happyhacker.org">http://www.happyhacker.org</a>)

<br>These show you how to set up your Win95 box so you and your friends

can

<br>practice breaking into each others' computers over the Internet.&nbsp;

This will

<br>give you a good start.&nbsp; But this approach has some problems --

such as you

<br>only learn newbie stuff, and strangers might find your purposely vulnerable

<br>Win95 or Win98 box connected to the Internet -- and do terrible things

to it.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want a wargaming technique that will

take you all the way to the

<br>top, you need to set up a local area network in your home, and get

your

<br>friends to set up networks, too.&nbsp; Then you can experiment with

configuring

<br>firewalls and proxy servers, getting several computers with different

<br>operating systems working together, and trying out LAN networking techniques

<br>such as Netware, Microsoft Network, and TCP/IP; and much more.&nbsp;

You can

<br>increase your fun by trading accounts on your network for accounts

on your

<br>friends' LANs and get to freely experiment with many LANs.

<p>*************************************************************

<br>Newbie note: If you are a kid, the FIRST thing you will probably want

to do

<br>is make sure your parents understand why hacker wargaming will make

you rich

<br>and famous instead of in jail and infamous. Here's how

<br><a href="mailto:Paradox@kpservices.com">Paradox@kpservices.com</a>

won over his parents.

<br>&nbsp;

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wrote to you a while ago about

how to get my parents to accept&nbsp; the fact

<br>of their son being a white-hat hacker... You gave me the&nbsp; advice

to show

<br>them your article in the October issue of&nbsp; _Scientific American_

(which was a masterpiece, btw) and take it&nbsp; from there.&nbsp; Right

after my dad read it ... All was well!&nbsp; Then,&nbsp; by coincidence,

my best friend's Win95 box on a vulnerable cable&nbsp; connection was invaded

as part of a dumb IRC war he had going&nbsp; on...&nbsp; The intruders...

trashed my friend's box by using Back&nbsp; Orifice and then proceeded

to mess with the

<br>server our business&nbsp; page was on (along with our other e-mail

addresses). My

<br>parents ... are now security paranoid and want me to find out as much

as I

<br>can about computer security.&nbsp; My Aunt (a Sun Microsystems&nbsp;

employee) is

<br>getting me an Ultra 5&nbsp; SPARC Workstation for&nbsp; Christmas too!&nbsp;

My parents are

<br>also buying me a copy of Windows NT&nbsp; and System Commander so I

can run Linux

<br>too!&nbsp; I'm also going to&nbsp; get a (secure) cable connection

to the workstation

<br>in my room.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THANK YOU!&nbsp; THANK YOU!&nbsp; THANK YOU!</blockquote>

<p><b><font size=+1>What Kind of Hardware you Will Need -- and How to Get

it Cheap</font></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait! Wait!" some guys are saying.&nbsp; "I'm

not rich enough to build my own

<br>hacker research laboratory!"&nbsp; Guess what, you can put together

a really

<br>impressive lab for only a few hundred dollars.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you visited the web page of our Wargame

computer

<br><a href="http://koan.happyhacker.org">http://koan.happyhacker.org</a>?&nbsp;

The Web pages downloaded pretty fast, right?

<br>Did you get into the guest account and make merry with all the other

guys

<br>who had shells on koan?&nbsp; (Hint: the password for the guest account

is really

<br>stupid. Even a stupid person can guess it.) Did you give the netstat

command

<br>and see how many people were browsing its Web sites, making ftp connections

<br>and logged into shells all at once? Did you know that koan is a mere

25 Mhz

<br>486 box?

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Koan is so powerful because it runs FreeBSD,

a Unix type of operating

<br>system, instead of Windows. (The RAM disk for the temp directory helps,

<br>too:) Almost any Unix type operating system can take an ancient Intel-type

<br>computer and make it run fast!&nbsp; The 200th fastest supercomputer

in the world

<br>is a bunch of PCs running Linux and hooked together in parallel, in

<br>operation at Los Alamos National Laboratories.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can get a 25 Mhz PC, or even faster ones,

for almost nothing.&nbsp; Because

<br>they are so common, you can find cheap used ones in the classified

ads in

<br>the local paper, or buy them from computer stores that specialize in

used

<br>equipment.&nbsp; Then install Unix type operating systems on them.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, for major fun, buy ancient workstation

computers.&nbsp; You will rarely see

<br>them for sale in the classified ads of newspapers.&nbsp; However, you

can often

<br>pick them up at auctions.&nbsp; Of course you need to know a thing

or two about

<br>the hardware you buy at auctions, because usually you won't get to

try them

<br>out before bidding on them.&nbsp; Many people who buy workstations

at auctions

<br>figure most of them have things wrong with them.&nbsp; So they buy

a bunch of

<br>them and then use parts from some of them to fix the others.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You would be surprised by what an ancient

Sun can do.&nbsp; A Sun SPARC

<br>workstation running at 25 Mhz is surprisingly fast for the same reason

a 25

<br>Mhz PC is fast running some sort of Unix -- it's the Unix that makes

it

<br>fast!&nbsp; In addition, if you want to have many simultaneous users,

for example

<br>if you want to give shell accounts to many users, a Sun should be faster

<br>than a PC with an equivalent clock speed.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't feel you have the hardware expertise

to piece together a cheap

<br>Sun workstation yourself, by paying a little bit more you can buy them

from

<br>resellers who get them at auctions.&nbsp; If you can find a local auction

that

<br>sells workstations, you best bet may be to go to the auction and introduce

<br>yourself to the people you see buying hardware that you want to own.&nbsp;

They

<br>will probably be willing to resell to you as soon as they get the equipment

<br>working.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can't find a cheap place to buy workstations

nearby, there are two

<br>places in Albuquerque where you can get refurbished workstations:

<br><a href="http://nmol.com/users/jcents">http://nmol.com/users/jcents</a>

(email <a href="mailto:jcents@nmol.com">jcents@nmol.com</a>); or email

Jake Garcia

<br>at <a href="mailto:jakeg@rt66.com">jakeg@rt66.com</a>.&nbsp; They pick

them up at auctions of used equipment from

<br>places such as Sandia National Laboratories, where people design nuclear

<br>weapons and nanomachinery.&nbsp; Sorry, you won't find classified data

left

<br>behind on these workstations!

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your next step in getting ready to set up

your hacker laboratory is the

<br>networking equipment.&nbsp; How do you get your computers talking to

each other?

<br>For that I recommend a 10BaseT Ethernet.&nbsp; This is probably the

easiest

<br>network you can set up.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hardware you will need for an Ethernet

will consist of a hub, an

<br>Ethernet device for each computer you plan to network together, and

either

<br>Category 3 or Category 5 Ethernet cables.&nbsp; The Ethernet cables

look like

<br>oversized phone cables.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can usually find a used hub for $20 or

so at a used computer store.

<br>Workstations usually have an Ethernet device of some sort already built

into

<br>them. However, look to see whether yours has a connector on the back

that

<br>looks like a slightly oversized phone jack.&nbsp; If it does, great.&nbsp;

If instead

<br>your workstation only has a connector that looks like what you use

for a

<br>cable TV (round with a wire in the center), and next to it a connector

that

<br>looks like the serial port on the back of your PC, you have a slight

<br>problem.&nbsp; You will need to buy an AUI to 10BaseT transceiver.&nbsp;

It is a

<br>little box with LEDs on it which hooks on one side to the thing that

looks

<br>like a serial port, and on the other side has a thing that looks like

a big

<br>phone jack.&nbsp; These are somewhat hard to find, and cost about $30

new.&nbsp; The

<br>electronic parts supplier Hamilton Hallmark sells them, as do many

other

<br>electronics parts suppliers.&nbsp; You rarely will find these transceivers

in

<br>computer stores because the average consumer doesn't run around networking

<br>old Unix workstations.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For PCs you usually need to buy an Ethernet

card.&nbsp; Even new, you can buy

<br>one for only $20.&nbsp; The cabling costs very little, and can often

be gotten

<br>for free if you pay a visit to an office building that is being renovated.

<br>I've gotten several hundred feet of Cat3 cable that way.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have gotten this far, you have all

the hardware you need for your

<br>hacker laboratory.

<p><b><font size=+1>How to Get Operating System Software Cheap</font></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your next problem will be operating system

software.&nbsp; One problem with

<br>buying old Unix workstations is that they generally have old operating

<br>systems for which there are many exploit programs floating around the

<br>Internet.&nbsp; While it may be fun for a while proving to yourself

that within

<br>seconds you can break into these old boxes, pretty soon this will get

<br>boring.&nbsp; You will get the craving to upgrade to the latest versions

of these

<br>operating systems.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where you may get to faint, when you

find out what this costs.

<br>There are exceptions, however.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My favorite kind of used workstations is Suns.&nbsp;

The reason I like old Suns

<br>is that you can either run them using whatever operating system it

came with

<br>(either Sun OS or Solaris, which will probably be an old version and

easy to

<br>break into) or you can upgrade cheaply to the latest version of Solaris,

to

<br>Sun Linux, or Sun OpenBSD.&nbsp; Even a SPARC 1 can run the latest

versions of

<br>all of these! To get the latest Solaris for almost nothing, see

<br><a href="http://www.sun.com/developers/solarispromo.html">http://www.sun.com/developers/solarispromo.html</a>.&nbsp;

This offer includes the

<br>manuals as well as a set of installation CDs. Or, you can get a version

of

<br>Linux that runs on Sun workstations (Red Hat) at <a href="http://www.redhat.com">http://www.redhat.com</a>,

or

<br>of OpenBSD from <a href="http://www.openBSD.org">http://www.openBSD.org</a>.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For PCs, your best bet for cheap Unix, if

you are a total beginner, is Red

<br>Hat.&nbsp; It is easy to install and tech support is great.&nbsp; There

are at least

<br>two other Linux distributions that beginners find easy to use: Slackware

3.5

<br>(<a href="http://www.cdrom.com">http://www.cdrom.com</a>) and Debian

(<a href="http://www.debian.com">http://www.debian.com</a>).&nbsp; While

they are a

<br>bit harder to install, they are easier to make secure.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also get a version of Solaris that

will run on PCs (see above URL).

<br>&nbsp;If Linux is new to you, check out <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/ldp.html">http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/ldp.html</a>

for

<br>lots of beginner information. Or, start out with Trinux, at

<br><a href="http://www.trinux.org">http://www.trinux.org</a>, for a beginner's

version that doesn't require you to

<br>repartition your hard disk (which the other Linuxes do).

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are already a power user of Linux,

and want to build a really secure

<br>LAN, you may wish to move up to either FreeBSD (<a href="http://www.freebsd.org">http://www.freebsd.org</a>

or

<br><a href="http://www.cdrom.com">http://www.cdrom.com</a>) or Open BSD

(<a href="http://www.openbsd.org">http://www.openbsd.org</a>).&nbsp; These

operating

<br>systems, along with Solaris 2.6 and above, are designed to resist most

of

<br>the buffer overflows that are the basis of many break-in techniques.&nbsp;

These

<br>BSD operating systems are more difficult to install, however.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I could tell you how to get a cheap

version of Windows NT Server

<br>4.0. However, the only way I know of is not exactly legal.&nbsp; You

may be able

<br>to obtain a free beta copy of Windows NT 5.0, however -- keep checking

out

<br>the Microsoft Web site (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com</a>)

for opportunities.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How about LAN software?&nbsp; If you have

decided to work with Windows only, and

<br>don't plan on connecting your LAN to the Internet, all you have to

do is

<br>cable each computer to your hub, and point and click your way through

<br>networking. As for Novell Netware -- sorry, I don't know of a cheap

way to

<br>get it.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are serious about hacking, you will

be connecting several different

<br>operating systems together on your LAN.&nbsp; For this I recommend

using TCP/IP

<br>and making one of your computers a gateway to the Internet.&nbsp; This

is a

<br>little harder than "Network Neighborhood" style networking.&nbsp; I

know that

<br>because -- you will be shocked to hear this -- I am living proof that

it is

<br>easy to make mistakes when setting up a TCP/IP network.&nbsp; Imagine

that!&nbsp; So

<br>I'm going to devote the next Guide in this series to how to set up

a LAN

<br>with an Internet gateway and both Windows and Unix boxes on it using

TCP/IP.

<br>Maybe I can figure out how to explain it so it will be easier for you

than

<br>it was for me.
