<P>The Macintosh platform is not traditionally known for being a cracking platform.
It is far more suited to hacking. Programming for the Mac is every bit as challenging
as programming for any other environment. Knowledge of C is generally a requisite.
For that reason, hacking on the Mac platform can be fun (and occasionally frustrating).
<I>Cracking</I> (with respect to the Internet anyway) on the Mac platform, however,
is another matter entirely.</P>
<P>First, early TCP/IP implementations on the Mac platform were primarily client
oriented. Many server packages do now exist for the Mac, but until recently, TCP/IP
was not what I would call an &quot;integrated&quot; part of the traditional MacOS.
Today, the situation is vastly different. The advancement of integrated TCP/IP in
the MacOS has grown tremendously.</P>
<P>Apple has taken special steps to ensure that the MacOS TCP/IP support is superb.
These efforts have manifested through the development of Open Transport technology.
Open Transport is an implementation that provides high-level control at the network
level. For example, Open Transport allows multiple, simultaneous TCP/IP connections,
the number of which is limited only by memory and processor power. Inherent within
the system is automated flow control, which detects the need for fragmentation of
IP datagrams. That means when a network segment is encountered that cannot handle
large packets, Open Transport automatically reverts to fragmentation.</P>
<P>Open Transport has completely integrated MacOS with both TCP/IP and AppleTalk,
making it one of the most flexible networking implementations currently available.
It now comes stock in System 7.5.3 and above.

<P>Programming on the Mac is a challenge. However, most Macintosh users are not so
intensely preoccupied with the inner workings of their operating system as users
of UNIX systems or even IBM compatibles. The reason has nothing to do with the level
of proficiency of Mac users. It has to do with the design of the MacOS itself. The
MacOS was conceived with ease of use in mind. Many tasks that are grueling under
other operating systems are only a click away on the modern Macintosh. Take, for
example, getting connected to the Internet. Only in the last few years have UNIX
systems made this process simple. Prior to that, many different files had to be edited
correctly and the user had to have some knowledge of UUCP. In contrast, the Mac user
is rarely confronted with special configuration problems that call for tweaking the
operating system. Therefore, there are few Mac Internet crackers.</P>
<P>For those planning to use the Macintosh platform for hacking or cracking, however,
there are plenty of resources. For programming, there are a staggering number of
choices beyond the traditional C that you normally associate with Mac development.
Some of these are ports of languages from other platforms and others are development
tools written specifically for the Macintosh. Unfortunately, there are not yet as
many free tools for use on Macs as there are for other platforms.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, Mac users take a lot of abuse on the Internet. Users who enjoy other
platforms often make fun of Mac users, telling them to get a &quot;real&quot; operating
system. Well, before we get into what tools are available for cracking on a Mac,
I would like to take a moment to offer the Mac community a little vindication. First
of all, the number of development tools available for Macintosh is staggering. Rather
than list them all here, I have picked a few interesting ones. They are listed in
Table 20.1.

<H2><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>Password Crackers and Related Utilities</B></FONT></H2>
<P>The utilities described in the following sections are popular password crackers
or related utilities for use on Macintosh. Some are made specifically to attack Mac-oriented
files. Others are designed to crack UNIX password files. This is not an exhaustive
list, but rather a sample of the more interesting tools freely available on the Internet.
<H3><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>PassFinder</B></FONT></H3>
<P>PassFinder is a password cracking utility used to crack the administrator password
on FirstClass systems. This is an important utility. The program suite FirstClass
is a gateway system, commonly used for serving e-mail, UUCP, and even news (NNTP).
In essence, FirstClass (which can be found at <A HREF="http://www.softarc.com/"><TT>http://www.softarc.com/</TT></A>)
is a total solution for mail, news, and many other types of TCP/IP-based communication
systems. It is a popular system on the MacOS platform. (It even has support for Gopher
servers and FTP and can be used to operate a full-fledged BBS.) Because FirstClass
servers exist not only on outbound Internet networks, but also on intranets, PassFinder
is a critical tool. By cracking the administrator password, a user can seize control
of the system's incoming and outgoing electronic communications. (However, this must
be done on the local machine. That is, the user must have access to the console of
the instant machine. This is not a remote cracking utility.)

tools, and other, assorted scripts useful in harassment of one's enemies. It's primarily
used in warfare.

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>Unserialize Photoshop</B></FONT></H3>
<P>Unserialize Photoshop is a standard serial number-killing utility, designed to
circumvent serial number protection on Adobe Photoshop. This utility really falls
into the traditional cracking category. I don't think that this type of activity
does much to shed light on security issues. It is basically a tool to steal software.
Therefore, I will refrain from offering any locations here. Adobe is a good company--perhaps
the only company ever to get the best of Microsoft. My position on stealing software
(though I've stated it before) is this: You want free software? Get FreeBSD or Linux
and go GNU. This way, you get quality software for free and still maintain extreme
cool.

<FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>NOTE:</B></FONT><B> </B>A large portion of the Macintosh

	of all manners of software are posted monthly. (These documents often exceed 300KB
	in length and include hundreds of serial numbers. The most famed such distribution
	is called &quot;The Hacker's Helper,&quot; which typically comes out once a month.)
	While this is their own affair, I should relate here that this type of activity is
	the precise antithesis of hacking. The only thing worse than this (and more removed
	from hacking) would be to steal such software and claim that you wrote it.

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>WordListMaker</B></FONT></H3>
<P>WordListMaker is a utility designed to manage dictionary files. This is invaluable
if you plan to crack password files of any size, or files on which the users may
speak more than one language (forcing you to use not only American English dictionaries,
but perhaps others, including British English, Italian, French, German, and so forth).
The utility is designed to merge dictionary files, a function that on a UNIX system
takes no more than a brief command line but that, on many other platforms, can be
a laborious task.

The author shows a series of messages between AOL personnel discussing the AOL4FREE

between AOL's inner staff discussed various signatures that AOL4FREE would leave
on the system during a sign-on. Having identified these sign-on signatures, the staff

<P>However, things did not go as well as the internal staff of AOL had hoped. Since
their e-mail was intercepted, a new version of AOL4FREE was created that fixed the
problem. Thus, the new version would continue to work, even after AOL had installed
their &quot;AOL4FREE Detector.&quot; This is discussed in the document:

<DL>
	<DD>Looks pretty bad, doesn't it, with the Secret Service and everything. But not
	to worry...with v4 of AOL4Free, you are much harder to detect! You see, what AOL4Free
	does is send the free token after every real token. When you are signing on, you
	send the &quot;Dd&quot; token with you screen name and password, and a free &quot;K1&quot;
	token is sent afterward. However, because you aren't really signed on yet, AOL sees
	the K1 token as a bug and records it in a log. All the Network Ops people had to
	do is search their logs for this bug and voil&#224;, they had their AOL4Free users.
	v4 is modified so that it doesn't send the free token after &quot;Dd&quot;.

<P>It will be interesting to see what happens. I have a strong feeling that new versions
of AOL4FREE are about to be released. (Don't ask me why. Call it a premonition.)
From my point of view, this would not be so bad. In my not-so-humble-opinion, AOL
has, until very recently, engaged in Information Superhighway robbery. However, that
opinion has not enough weight for me to print the location of version 4 in this book.
<H2><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>The WebStar Controversy</B></FONT></H2>
<P>On October 15, 1995, a challenge was posted to the Internet: A Macintosh Web server
running WebStar was established and offered as a sacrificial host on the Net. If
anyone could crack that server, that person would be awarded $10,000.00. The challenge
was a demonstration of the theory that a Mac would be more secure than a UNIX box
as a Web server platform. Did anyone collect that 10 grand? No.</P>
<P>Chris Kilbourn, the president and system administrator for digital.forest, an
Internet service provider in Seattle, Washington, posted a report about that challenge.
(I will be pointing you there momentarily.) In it, he explains

<DL>
	<DD>In the 45 days the contest ran, no one was able to break through the security
	barriers and claim the prize. I generally ran the network packet analyzer for about
	3-5 hours a day to check for interesting packets destined for the Challenge server.
	I created packet filters that captured all TCP/IP network traffic in or out of the
	Challenge server. One of the more amusing things was that even with all the information
	about the technical specifications of the Challenge server posted on the server itself,
	most of the people who tried to bypass the security thought that the server was a
	UNIX box! TCP/IP services on a Macintosh lack the low-level communications that is
	available on UNIX systems, which provides additional security. If you are careful
	to keep your mail, FTP, and HTTP file spaces from overlapping, there is no way to
	pipe data from one service to another and get around security in that manner.

<P>So what really happened here? Did the challenge ultimately prove that a Mac is
more secure than a UNIX box as a Web server platform? Yes and no. To understand why
both answers are valid, you need to have a few particulars.</P>
<P>First, the machine included in the challenge was running only a Web server. That
is, it did not run any other form of TCP/IP server or process. (How realistic that
would be in a Mac serving as anything other than exclusively a Web server is an area
of some dispute. However, for the moment, we are dealing with a simple Web server.)</P>
<P>Therefore, the simple answer is yes, a standalone Mac Web server is more secure
than a full-fledged UNIX server running a Web daemon. However, that is not the end
of the story. For example, the UNIX server can do things that the Mac server cannot.
That includes file transfers by a dozen or more different protocols. It also includes
handling file sharing with more than a dozen platforms. The key here is this: For
a sacrificial Web server, the Mac is a better choice (that is, unless your system
administrator is very well versed in security). UNIX has just too many protocols
that are alive by default. Part of the security gained by the Mac is in the fact
that there is no command interpreter that is well known by UNIX or IBM users behind
the Web server. However, there <I>is</I> a way to crack such a server. Here's a report
from an Apple Technical article:

<DL>
	<DD>Through the power of AppleScript and Apple events, WebSTAR can communicate with
	other applications on your Macintosh to publish any information contained in those
	programs. For example, if your company information is in a FileMaker Pro database,
	Web client users can query it via HTML forms to get the data using the FileMaker
	CGI (Common Gateway Interface) for WebSTAR. It's powerful and easy to use.
</DL>

<P>The AppleScript engine is indeed an interpreter; it's just not one known intimately
by a large population of non-MacOS users. The problem must therefore be approached
by someone who is deeply familiar with TCP/IP, AppleScript, and cracking generally.
I would imagine that the list of such persons is fairly short. However, these are
the elements that would be required. So know that it is not impossible. It is simply
that the majority of cracking knowledge has been UNIX-centric. This will change rapidly
now that the Internet is becoming so incredibly popular. Apple experts advise that
security issues should remain a constant concern if you are providing remote services.
In a document designed to provide guidance in setting up an Internet server, the
folks at Apple offer this:

<DL>
	<DD>Although Mac OS-based services present a much lower security risk than services
	run on UNIX machines, security considerations can never be taken too seriously on
	the Internet. Many routers have a number of &quot;firewall&quot; features built in,
	and these features should be carefully considered, especially for larger networks.
	Although most Mac OS security issues can be addressed simply by ensuring that access
	privileges are set correctly, investigating additional security options is always
	a good idea.

<P>Certainly, it has already been proven that a Mac Web server can be vulnerable
to denial-of-service attacks, including the dreaded Sequence of Death. In a recent
article by Macworld, the matter is discussed:

<DL>
	<DD>...for Mac Webmaster Jeff Gold, frustration turned to alarm when he realized
	that a mere typo caused his entire Mac-served site to crash. Gold's crash occurred
	while he was using StarNine's WebStar Web server software and the plug-in version
	of Maxum Development's NetCloak 2.1, a popular WebStar add-on. Adding certain characters
	to the end of an URL crashes NetCloak, bringing down the server. To protect the thousands
	of sites using NetCloak, neither Gold nor Macworld will publicly reveal the character
	sequence, but it's one that wouldn't be too difficult to enter. After further investigation,
	Macworld discovered that the problem surfaces only when a server runs the plug-in
	version of NetCloak. When we removed the plug-in and used the NetCloak CGI instead,
	the Sequence of Death yielded only a benign error message.

<P>Note that this problem was unrelated to Apple. This brings back the point that
I have made many times: When software developers and engineers are developing packages
at different times, in different places, and within the confines of different companies,
security holes can and do surface. This is because acquiring the API is sometimes
not enough. Here is a great example of such a situation: Have you ever used version
1.5.3 of ASD's DiskGuard? If you have, I'll bet you were a bit confused when you
couldn't access your own hard disk drive:

<DL>
	<DD>Security software is supposed to keep the bad guys out, but let you in. In some
	cases, version 1.5.3 of ASD software's DiskGuard was preventing even a system's owner
	from accessing their machine. This week the company posted a patch for its security
	software application; version 1.5.4 fixes several compatibility problems--including
	locked and inaccessible hard drives--between DiskGuard 1.5.3 and several Mac systems.
	If you use DiskGuard on a PowerMac 7200, 7500, 8500, or a PowerBook 5300/5300c, ASD's
	technical support recommends you upgrade. The patch is available directly from ASD
	Software (909/624-2594) or from the ASD forum on CompuServe (Go ASD).

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>However, all this discussion is really immaterial. Average Macintosh users are
not security fanatics and therefore, their personal machines are probably subject
to at least minimal attack. This will depend on whether they have their disk and
resources shared out. The Macintosh file sharing system is no less extensive (nor
much more secure) than that employed by Microsoft Windows 95. The only significant
difference is that in the Mac environment, you can not only turn off file sharing,
but also pick and choose which files you want to share. This is done by going to
the Sharing Options panel and making the appropriate settings.

<P>Naturally, in a network, this may be a complex matter. Your choices will be made
depending on the trust relationships in your organization. For example, if you are
in a publishing department of a magazine, perhaps you take commercial advertisements
but the copy for these is generated in another portion of the building (or at the
very least, another portion of the network). It may require that you share a series
of folders so that you can conveniently traffic ad copy between your department and
the advertising department.</P>
<P>The file sharing hole is a matter of extreme concern. At the very least, every
Mac user should establish a password for himself as the owner of the machine. Furthermore,
that password should be carefully considered. Mac passwords are subject to attack,
the same as any other password on every password system ever created. Care should
be taken to choose a characteristically &quot;strong&quot; password. If this term
<I>strong password</I> is a foreign concept to you, please review Chapter 10, which
contains a series of references to reports or technical white papers that discuss
the difference between weak and strong password choices and how to make them. Finally
(and perhaps most importantly), guest access privileges should be set to inactive.</P>
<P>But, then, as most experienced Mac users know, file sharing is not the only security
hole in the Macintosh environment. There are obscure holes and you have to dig very
deep to find them. Apple (much like Microsoft) is not nearly as gung-ho about advertising
vulnerabilities on their platform as, say, the average UNIX vendor. Typically, they
keep the matter a bit more isolated to their particular community.</P>
<P>Naturally, MacOS holes are like holes on any other operating system. Today, if
you purchase a brand new Mac with the latest distribution of MacOS, you have a guarantee
of good security. However, again, not everyone uses the latest and the greatest.
For example, do you remember Retrospect? If you have used it (or are now using it)
have you ever seen this advisory:

<DL>
	<DD>When you install the Retrospect Remote Control Panel and restart, Remote is activated
	and waits for the server to download a security code and serial number. If the server
	does not do this, anyone with a copy of Retrospect and a set of serial numbers can
	initialize your system, backup your hard drive to theirs, and then de-initialize
	your system without you noticing.

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>StartUpLog</B></FONT></H3>
<P>Created by Aurelian Software and Brian Durand, StartUpLog is a snooper application.
It begins logging access (and a host of other statistics) from the moment the machine
boots. Using this utility is very easy. It ships as a Control Panel. You simply install
it as such and it will run automatically, logging the time, length, and other important
information of each access of your Mac. It's good for parents or employers.

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>Super Save</B></FONT></H3>
<P>For the ultimate paranoiac, Super Save is truly an extraordinary utility. This
utility will record every single keystroke forwarded to the console. However, in
a thoughtful move, the author chose to include an option with which you can disable
this feature whenever passwords are being typed in, thus preventing the possibility
of someone else later accessing your logs (through whatever means) and getting that
data. Although not expressly designed for security's sake (more for data crash and
recovery), this utility provides the ultimate in logging.

utility. I suggest using this utility first. If evidence of tampering or unauthorized
access appears, then I would switch to Super Saver.

offers full-fledged password protection for the MacOS. First, the utility offers
several levels of protection. For example, you can create an administrator password
and then individual user passwords beneath it. Moreover, Sesame will actually protect
against a floppy boot attack. In other words, whatever folders or files you hide
or password protect with this utility, those options will still be evident (and the
controls still present) even if a local user attempts to bypass security measures
by booting with a floppy disk. This is shareware with a $10 licensing fee and was
