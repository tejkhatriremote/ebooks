             On Unix, the login program is the software that usually does the password
authentication when someone telnets to the machine.  Intruders grabbed the
source code to login.c and modified it that when login compared the user's
password with the stored password, it would first check for a backdoor
password. If the user typed in the backdoor password, it would allow you to
log in regardless of what the administrator sets the passwords to.  Thus
this allowed the intruder to log into any account, even root.
