<%=-------------------------------------------------------------------------=%>

[ Introduction ]

     Phreaking is a method used by most intelligent people {most often those
who use a computer and a Modulator-Demodulator (MoDem)}.  If you happen to
resemble the major mass of people who do not have the income to afford large
phone bills then phreaking is for you.  If you live in an area with an
Electronic Switching System [ESS] then phreaking is something which should be
done in moderate amounts. Nearly all countries can "phreak" but each country 
may use a different method. 

<%=-------------------------------------------------------------------------=%>

[ Switching Systems ]

Three types of switching systems are present in the United States today:

               [1] Step by Step
               [2] Crossbar
               [3] ESS  {Electronic Switching System}


                         <] Step by Step [>

First switching system used in America, adopted in 1918 and until 1978 Bell
had over 53% of all exchanges using Step by Step [SxS].  A long, and con-
fusing train of switches is used for SxS switching.

                         [> Disadvantages <]
   [A] The switch train may become jammed : Blocking call.
   [B] No DTMF [Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency]["Touch-tone"].
   [C] Much maintenance and much electricity.
   [D] Everything is hard wired

                        +> Identification <+
   [A] No pulsing digits after dialing or DTMF.
   [B] Phone Company sounds like many typewriters.
   [C] No:  Speed calling, Call forwarding, and other services.
   [D] Pay-phone wants money first before dial-tone.


                           <] Crossbar [>

Crossbar has been Bell's primary switcher after 1960.  Three types of Crossbar
switching exist:  Number 1 Crossbar [1XB], Number 4 Crossbar [4XB], and Number
5 Crossbar [5XB].  A switching matrix is used for all the phones in an area.
When someone calls, the route is determined and is met up with the other phone.
The matrix is set-up in horizontal and vertical paths.  There are no definite
distinguishing features of Crossbar switching.


                              <] ESS [>

You probably were hoping I wouldn't talk about this nightmare, if you did you
will know why everyone doesn't want to be reminded about Bell's holocaust on
America.  With ESS Bell knows:  every digit dialed {including mistakes!}, who
you call, when you called, how long you were connected, and in some cases,
what you talked about!  Yes, this is the closest anyone has come to true
Totalitarianism.  ESS is programed to print out the numbers of people who make
excessive calls to WATS numbers [Wide Area Telephone Service][1-800 numbers]
or directory assistance.  This deadly trap is called "800 Exceptional Calling
Report."  ESS can be programed to print logs of who called certain numbers.
Electronic Switching System makes the job of the FBI, Bell Security {The
Gestapo in phreakin' tongue}, NSA, and other organizations which like to invade
our privacy, extremely easy!  Tracing is done in microseconds, and the results
are printed out on the monitor of a Gestapo officer.  ESS can also pick up
foreign tones on the line, like 2600 Hz. {used in blue boxes, discussed later}.
Bell claims that the entire country will be plagued by ESS by the 1990's!

                           +> Identification <+
   [A] Dialing 911 for emergencies.
   [B] Dial-tone first for pay-phones.
   [C] Calling services, like:  Call forwarding, Speed dialing, Call waiting.
   [D] ANI [Automatic Number Identification] for long-distance calls.


[[[Note]]]  of the above identifications of the three switching systems, do
            not solely rely on these descriptions, the best way to find out
            is to [no!] call your local telephone company.

<%=-------------------------------------------------------------------------=%>

[ Long-Distance Services ]

To attempt to help the community {and for private business} companies developed
ways to lessen the costs of long-distance calling charges.  The companies own
their own switching systems and use extenders for callers to call.  The way
extenders operate:  1] Customer calls service, 2] He/she hears a low tone which
sounds like a dial-tone, 3] She/he either dials the access code then the phone
number, or dials the phone number then the access code, 4] Is connected to
whatever he/she calls.  Aside from Ma Bells collection, the customer receives a
bill for calls made with his/her long-distance company {a supposedly cheaper
bill than Ma Bell's}.  Thought:  Hey, I could randomly pick access codes and
use them to call whatever area the company services!  Right, that's what basic
phreaking is!  A wise idea, though, is to have many access codes and many
service numbers to rotate throughout your average life as a phreaker.  To aid
in your quest to beat the system I have provided many 1-800 numbers which
anyone can call, aside from local numbers, such as Sprint, or MCI.  The reason
for providing you with WATS numbers is because all of us aren't in a big city
where Sprint or MCI even exist, this way everyone can phreak!  A way to find
more access codes is by using your old modem.  Yes, your modem can imitate DTMF
tones!

  {>Procedure:  1)  dial 1-800  +  service number
                2)  dial access code->area code->phone number, or
                3)  dial area code->phone number->access code

[ Colored Boxes ]

A more shrewd, technological, safer {without ESS} way to phreak is with a piece
of hardware known as a ________ Box.  Boxes are many different colors {I don't
know ALL the colors because it seems like every time I turn around there's some
new color out!}.  Colors I have heard of:  Blue, Black, Red, White, Silver,
Clear, and MANY, MANY more...  Plans for making these boxes can be obtained by
calling different boards [BBS's], AE lines, or whatever.  But!, if you have an
Apple Cat modem then do I have good news for ->you<-!!  The Apple Cat modem
can emulate the frequencies {usually 2600 Hz.} made by ________ Boxes with the
help of a handy little program called "Cat's Meow!"

          Taken from the Hackers Handbook.........
<%=-------------------------------------------------------------------------=%>
[All Boxes and explanation of what they do]

Slush Box Can be installed at places of business that have the standard multi-line phones. The box will be used on business phone systems like the "Com-Key" or similar phones.

Static Box Keep the voltage on a phone line high.

Switch Box Add hold, indicator lights, conferencing, etc.

Tan Box Line-activated telephone recorder.

Tron Box Reverse the phase of power to your house, causing your electric meter to run slower.

Urine Box Create a capacitative disturbance between the ring and tip wires in another's telephone headset.

Violet Box Keeps a payphone from hanging up.

White Box A portable DTMF keypad.

Yellow Box  Add an extension phone.

[How to make each box]

Each box requires the owner to actually make the box and fit it into the 
voice part of their phone. The plans are available from most hacking pages, 
and will soon be available from my own page. There are also programs which
run on your computer and only need access to a SB or Gravis sound card, the
programs play tones over the phone line to represent either the red or the 
blue box. Probably the only one that`s any good is Bluebeep.

############################################################################

Hacking takes on many different forms, there are people who are happy to 
just read information and never try their hand at hacking, The average hacker 
will have penetrated some form of a UNIX server and found information which
is not actively available to themselves. The next step in hacking, is the 
malicious bastards who wreak BBS`s and spread virii across LAN networks.
Hackers can be classed in many different form`s. My advice to Newbies who 
want to start is, first read this file and try and get your hands on some 
other hacking texts, once you feel confident try breaking into an easily
penatratable system, don`t try anything which you could get sued for, or
enough arrested for, until you feel confident enough to try.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     The many tools of hackers.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@Credit card Generators.@

Explanation.
These are easily explaned as they spit out randomly generated credit card 
numbers for different cards.

What can I use them for ??
The only use I`ve found for credit card generators is to hack into a server
provider and get a free account. You can`t really get free thing`s from
your credit card due to the fact that the CC Generator doesn`t give you 
the name of the card holder, or the expiry date. Another good idea is to 
use them in the many "Adultcheck" parts of the web, just tap in your Credit
card number and fake the rest of the sign up process. You will be given
the password instatly and you will be able to proceed without anyone knowing.

What do I need ??
Try and get The Credit Card Generator, and a program that Verify`s the card.
Try ThcCred.zip, and VC.zip.

/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
@Anonymous mail@ 

Explanation.
Anonymous mail is a very handy thing to have. You can send mail to any one
without showing your return address, this can also be used on a newsgroup
if your sending some "sensitive" material and you don`t want anything 
traced back to you.

What can I use it for ??
Sending mail to someone without your address showing. This used to be done
by telnetting to port 25 on a server. But modern programs do that for
you now. 

What do I need ??
All you need is ONE good anonymous mailing program, I would recomend private
idaho, if you can find it.

/\/\/\/\/\//\/\/\/\/\//\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\//\/\//\/\/\/\
@Mailbombers@

Explanation.
These arn`t as nasty as they sound, they don`t blow the persons mailbox up.
All they do is send as many mails as you specify to the person you specify.

Why do this ??
Say for example, some one`s been getting on your nerves. You can use a 
mailbomber program to send loads of mail to the person, so he`s got to 
download all the mail which will take him ages, and increase his phone 
bill, online connection time, and increase his temper !!.

What do I need ??
Once again, all you need is a good Mailbombing piece. I`ve tried most of 
them and found ONLY Unibomber to be VERY easy to use. Upyourz is supposed
to be good, but Unibomber is the easiest to set up.

But Dajimbo, If I`m sending 1000 mails, won`t that take ME ages ??
No, becuase the Bomber sends mail at a VERY quick speed. So you shouldn`t 
have to wait more than a few minutes.

/\/\/\/\//\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\//\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\//\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\//\
@Wardiallers@

Explanation. 
Wardiallers are programs which scan every number in an area code you specify
looking for the connect tone.

Why do this ??
This is the basis of hacking, use this to find out a place nearby which
has a modem attached and you can hack into the machine. This could be 
used for finding your school/college number, so you can hack into there
computer, or you might find a big business number which you can use to find
out information on whatever you want.

What do I need ??
All wardiallers are VERY easy to use, so just find the one with a decent
file size and your away !!!......If you don`t know where to look, 
go to my site.

/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
@Virii@

Explanation.
Virii is the term for Virus, such as the computer kind. Viruses can do
many different things, most are malicious but they are types which do 
special thing`s. Such as play a tune, or display a message.

Different types of Virii :
Spawning : These viruses copy themselves to the file, and infect it, thus 
at the end of the day, you have a computer full of infected files.

Trojan Horse : These do a quick attack. Such as wiping your hard drive, as 
soon as you click on it.

E-Mail : These are NONE existent. So don`t FALL for it.

Timebomb : These are the kewlest in my opinion, because they lie dorment
in a unsuspected computer until the date the author speciefies, and then
they go off and wipe the harddrive. Hahaa.....

There`s also many more different types, but that`s the basics.

What can I use these for ??
Infecting an unsuspected computer, or spreading it across unsuspected 
corporate pigs computers, who have more money than sense.

What do I need ??

You need a compiler, such as Tasm, to compile your virus. Most Viruses are
wrote in assembley C code. But as most people reading this won`t know how
to, Use a decent program that`s someone`s made to make yourself a virus.
You won`t be able to make a really good virus, but there not bad.
Try and find, Virus Lab Creator, or the Nasty tool kit, or even NRLG.
Also you may find that TLink is usful, in the way that it links the virus 
to a file such as a picture.

/\/\/\/\/\/\//\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\//\/\/\/\/\/\/\\/\/\/\/\//\/\/\/\/\/\
@Keystroke Recorders@

Explanation...

These Log anything that`s typed on the person`s computer or network, to a 
file which you can scrape off later and read at your own leisure.

Why do this ??
The best use is to get someone`s log on screename and password, off a Lan
Network. But if people don`t use a LAN network, then you could, use it to
read anythging you want, what someone who uses your computer types.

What do I need ??

A Basic Key stroke recorder, or the best I found, is Password Leacher.

/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\\/\/\/\/\/\/\\//\\/\/\/\/\\/\/\/\/\/
@Password Crackers@
@Grenadiers@

Explanation.....

Passwords crackers, are used to crack passwords to a shareware program, or a 
pirate program.
Grenadiers, are basically the same, apart from they try and "Bust" there way
into the password by using a dictionary of words.

Why do this ??
Do you want a free program or not !!!

What do I need ??
I`m not a cracker, so just try and find a good cracking program. You`ll also
need a disassembler such as softice. A good grenedier is Claymore.

\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\//\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\

@Warez@

Explanation...
These arn`t really hackers just pirates, who upload programs and games, for 
people to download for free.
They don`t make a profit, and there site doesn`t last very long. So it`s
hard to find a good site.
You`ll also need a fast modem, to download the program as most are massive.

/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\

@Modem Jammer@

Explantion...

There`s only one of these about, and is "Supposedly" jams the phone line, so
no one can track you down.
Although if you live in the UK, all you need to do is type 141 infront of 
the number and you won`t be traced by a normal system.

****************************************************************************
*                  Advice to Newbies....                                   *
****************************************************************************

Everyone starts somewhere, and people who tell you too fuck off are idiots
and don`t know anything about hacking anyway. Just stick at it and you`ll 
get there finally. 
The file I`ve just wrote, might help you a tiny bit, in the understanding, 
of different terms, but if it doesn`t then I don`t care.
Right onto the advice :
Don`t talk in supposedly hackers Jargon......e.g. iM a HaCkEr AnD dA PhReAk.
This is sad and hard to read. Also the only response you`ll recieve is
"Fix that keyboard !!"
Don`t type in CAPITALS. This annoys people and you`ll get told to shut up.
Ask for help on Newsgroups, but be specific, also ask nicely, don`t write :
Give me telnet codes......
Just phrase your letter so that it doesn`t sound like your asking for the
world.
Don`t be put off if you find it hard, the more programs and text files, you
get the more you`ll understand.
Try and get these on your hard drive :
Tasm
NRLG.
Virus Lab Creator.
The credit card generator.
A fake AOl account.
A fake Compuserve account.
The beginners guide to hacking.
that`s the basics, and maybe`s a good wardialler....
