How Proxy Servers Work</A>

<P>
There are certain risks associated with allowing people from inside
an intranet to directly contact Internet servers and resources.
An intranet user might obtain a file from the Internet that could
damage the files on their computer and the entire intranet. Additionally,
when intranet users are allowed unfettered access to the Internet,
it is difficult for intranet administrators to guard against intruders
who attempt to take over an intranet computer or server.
<P>
A common way to block this kind of access is to use <I>proxy servers</I>.
These servers sit inside a firewall, frequently on a <I>bastion
host</I> (see <A HREF="ch16.htm" >Chapter 16</A> for more on how bastion hosts work).
They balance the two functions of providing intranet users with
easy access to the Internet and keeping the network secure. When
someone inside the intranet wants to contact the Internet to get
information or a resource-for example, to visit a Web page-they
don't actually contact the Internet directly. Instead, they contact
a proxy server inside an intranet firewall, and the proxy server
contacts the Internet (in this instance, a Web server). The Web
server sends the proxy server the page, and the proxy server then
sends that page to the requester on the intranet. 
<P>
Proxy servers can log all actions they take so that intranet administrators
can check for attacks. Proxy servers offer other benefits as well.
They can cache Internet Web pages in their memory, so that when
someone on the intranet wants to get back to a Web page they've
accessed before, the Web page will be delivered directly from
the proxy server, and the requester won't have to go out across
the Internet. Since intranet connections are often made at higher
speeds than Internet connections, that means quicker response
and faster viewing of Web pages and other Internet resources.
However, this would not be an acceptable response for time-sensitive
items like stock quotes, because the cached Web pages are not
the most current version.
<P>
There may be multiple proxy servers on a single intranet. There
may be separate proxy servers for the Web, Telnet, FTP, and other
Internet services. Often on an intranet, some services will require
a proxy server, while others will not. For example, this includes
anything involving Telnet or FTP, because they involve file transferring,
and they would be likely to be on a proxy server. When a new Internet
resource is first made available, such as streaming multimedia
files, proxy servers usually can't be used because proxy server
technology has not yet been developed for it. The intranet administrator
will have to decide whether to block those services completely
or let them be used until proxy software catches up to the new
technology.
<P>
Sometimes special proxy client software has to be used in concert
with proxy services. This can be a problem because not all operating
systems have proxy clients for all Internet services. Other possible
problems include nonstandard client software, which can be difficult
to use. A better approach is to use standard, off-the-shelf software
such as Netscape Navigator, and use a configuration screen that
tells the software where the proxy server can be found. The software
and server will then take care of the rest.

An integral part of many intranet security systems is a <I>proxy
server</I>. A proxy server is software and a server that sits
in a firewall and acts as a go-between among computers on an intranet
and the Internet. Proxy servers often run on bastion hosts. (See
<A HREF="ch16.htm" >Chapter 16</A> for more information on bastion hosts.) Only the proxy
server-instead of the many individual computers on the intranet-interact
with the Internet, so security can be maintained because the server
can be kept more secure than can hundreds of individual intranet
computers. Intranet administrators can set up proxy servers to
be used for many services, such as FTP, the Web, and Telnet. Intranet
administrators decide which Internet services must go through
a proxy server, and which do not have to. Specific proxy server
software is required for each different kind of Internet service.

<LI>When a computer on the intranet makes a request out to the
Internet-such as to retrieve a Web page from a Web server-the
internal computer actually contacts the proxy server, which in
turn contacts the Internet server. The Internet server sends the
Web page to the proxy server, which then forwards the page to
the computer on the intranet.
<LI>Proxy servers log all traffic between the Internet and the
intranet. For example, a Telnet proxy server could track every
single keystroke hit in every Telnet session on the intranet-and
could also track how the external server on the Internet reacts
to those keystrokes. Proxy servers can log every IP address, date
and time of access, URL, number of bytes downloaded, and so on.
This information can be used to analyze any attacks launched against
the network. It can also help intranet administrators build better
access and services for employees.
<LI>Some proxy servers must work with special proxy clients. A
more popular approach is to use off-the-shelf clients such as
Netscape with proxy servers. When such an off-the-shelf package
is used, it must be specially configured to work with proxy servers
from a configuration menu. Then the intranet employee uses the
client software as usual. The client software knows to go out
to a proxy server to get the data, instead of to the Internet.
<LI>Proxy servers can do more than relay requests back and forth
between an intranet and the Internet. They can also implement
security schemes. For example, an FTP proxy server could be set
up to allow files to be sent from the Internet to a computer on
the intranet, but to block files from being sent from the corporate
network out to the Internet-or vice versa. In this way, intranet
administrators can block anyone outside the corporation from downloading
vital corporate data. Or they can stop intranet users from downloading
files which may contain viruses.
<LI>Proxy servers can also be used to speed up the performance
of some Internet services by caching data-keeping copies of the
requested data. For example, a Web proxy server could cache many
Web pages, so that whenever someone from the intranet wanted to
get one of those Web pages, they could get it directly from the
proxy server across high-speed intranet lines, instead of having
to go out across the Internet and get the page at a lower speed
from Internet lines.
