<P>
The days of working at an office every day from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00
p.m. and only occasionally working into the night are long gone.
Today, people may be telecommuting from home, they may be on the
road, and they may work evenings or weekends from their home office.
The days of the virtual office are here, and intranets are an
important part of making that a reality.
<P>
Since intranets hold so much of a corporation's resources, and
since so much work these days is collaborative work done via the
network, people need access to the intranet in order to do any
work. That means they need some remote way of gaining access to
the intranet.
<P>
Typically, remote access is gained via a modem. The most common
method is to dial into a remote access server and its associated
modem bank. They dial in using one of the Internet's standard
dial-in protocols, either the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) or
the Serial Line Interface Protocol (SLIP). SLIP is an older protocol
and has fast been falling out of favor because the PPP protocol
is more robust, especially when it comes to handling errors. Part
of the process of dialing in involves identification of the user.
Some remote access servers hang up and call the individual back
at a pre-determined phone number.
<P>
After someone logs into the remote access server, he or she can
log into machines on the intranet just like in the office. The
intranet's firewall allows packets sent via the remote access
server to enter the intranet. Once they've logged in, they have
full access to the intranet, although at dial-in speeds instead
of at higher speeds available when actually at the office.
<P>
Providing dial-in access in this manner is expensive, because
corporations have to maintain large banks of modems that can be
dialed into, and because they have to pay for the costs of long-distance
and 800 telephone numbers.
<P>
A solution developed by Microsoft, 3Com, US Robotics, and others
is called the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP). This protocol
allows someone to dial into a local Internet Service Provider
(ISP), and from there access their intranet. Costs come down significantly,
because the call is made to a local phone number instead of a
long-distance one, and the banks of modem pools aren't needed.
<P>
PPTP also allows for people to use other network protocols, such
as IPX or NetBIOS, so they can access parts of the corporate network
that aren't TCP/IP-based. And it also allows for secure transmission
of data. It does this by encrypting the data being sent, and encapsulating
it and the other network protocols inside an IP packet. That IP
packet is then sent out over the Internet through a technique
called tunneling. On the receiving end, the outer IP envelope
is stripped off, and the protocols and data inside the packet
used. The person now has full access to the intranet and other
corporate network resources, and has done it by making a local
phone call.

In today's increasingly mobile world, it's important that people
be able to access a corporate intranet from their homes or from
the road. This illustration shows how that access can be gained
via a new protocol called the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol
(PPTP).
<OL>
<LI>Before the PPTP protocol, when people wanted to gain access
to an intranet they usually dialed into a remote access server
through its modem bank. After logging into the server, they were
then able to get access to the intranet's resources. One drawback
of this approach is that it required the corporation to pay for
long-distance or 800 telephone access and maintain the modem banks,
which can easily cost millions of dollars a year.
<LI>The PPTP protocol allows people to gain access to an intranet
by dialing into an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and requesting
to be sent to the intranet. The connection to the ISP is made
using the normal PPP Internet dial-in protocol. Since ISP calls
can be local calls, this cuts down tremendously on telecommunications
costs. It also means that the intranet need not have sizable modem
pools available to answer every incoming call, another significant
cost-savings.
<LI>The ISP has special software and hardware installed that uses
the PPTP protocol. An important component of gaining access to
an intranet is to ensure that any data sent to and from it is
secure. The PPTP protocol can encrypt the data in the IP packet
it receives. It then takes that encrypted packet and encapsulates
it inside another IP packet, sometimes called an envelope. PPTP
also allows remote users to get at corporate network information
that uses other protocols than TCP/IP, such as IPX and NetBIOS.
It does this by encapsulating it inside the IP packet as well.
<LI>The ISP sends the envelope with the encrypted data inside
it through the public Internet to the intranet. No one can read
what is inside the envelope since the data is encrypted. When
data is sent in this manner, it is called tunneling.
<LI>The data is sent through a firewall to a server on an intranet.
This server has the hardware and software necessary to handle
the incoming PPTP packets.
<LI>The person trying to get at intranet data will have to log
into this server with a user name and password, just as he or
she would have to if directly connected to the intranet, as a
way to keep out intruders. PPTP uses two protocols for allowing
people to log in, the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) and
the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP). See <A HREF="ch17.htm">Chapter
17</A> for more on how these protocols work.
<LI>The intranet server strips off the outside envelope. It then
decrypts the data inside the envelope. The person can now make
full use of the intranet-or other network resources. All packets
that pass between the intranet and the user will go through this
tunneling technique.
