<P>
In much of this book, we've seen how intranets and the Internet
can help streamline the ways that companies do business, and change
the way that people within a corporation communicate. For many
companies, though, the biggest benefit of an intranet can be counted
directly on the bottom line-intranets, used in conjunction with
the Internet, help the companies do business with their customers.
It allows the companies to better market their goods and services,
and to take direct orders right online over the intranet. And
it also allows the companies to order directly from other businesses
as well.
<P>
Today, the amount of business done on the Internet and over intranets
is relatively small. In the coming years, however, that business
is expected to grow to many billions of dollars. The dramatic
growth of the Internet has been fueled by business and consumers,
and it shows no sign of letting up. The Internet may become one
of the primary places that businesses operate-and is expected
to be the place where many billions of dollars of goods and services
will be bought and sold every year. Because of that, the ability
to do commerce is a vital part of any intranet.
<P>
Businesses will use intranets as a way to market and sell their
products and services. They will accept electronic payment using
an intranet as well.
<P>
Increasingly, businesses will use the Internet to market and sell
their products. Many people will buy things while at home and
at their place of business instead of at retail stores-and they
will use the Internet to browse through catalogs, and then make
purchases online.
<P>
There is a major problem that has to be overcome with electronic
commerce over the Internet and intranets, however. The nature
of the Internet is that it's an unsecured network. As packets
travel across it, anyone along the way could conceivably examine
those packets. Because of that, there are potential dangers to
doing business online-if you pay over the Internet with a credit
card, someone could conceivably snoop at it and steal your credit
card number and other identifying information. That means that
businesses that expect to sell goods and services need some secure
way to sell them.
<P>
A number of ways of making money payments across the Internet
have sprung up to solve the problem. Probably the one that will
be most used is the Secure Electronic Transaction protocol (SET)-a
set of procedures and protocols designed to make financial transactions
on the Internet as safe as possible. SET uses encryption technology
to make sure that no one can steal your credit card number; only
the sender and the receiver can decipher the numbers. See Chapter
17 for details on how encryption works. Major credit card companies
such as VISA, MasterCard, and American Express support SET, as
do software companies such as Microsoft and Netscape. With that
backing, SET will almost certainly become the standard way for
sending secure credit card information over the Internet.
<P>
There are other schemes for doing business over the Internet and
intranets. In some of them, credit cards aren't used. Instead,
people get electronic &quot;tokens&quot; that function as cash.
Various terms are being used for this new form of money, partly
from vendors offering electronic payment services, including NetCash,
CyberCash, .eCash, and emoney. Someone purchases a certain amount
of electronic money, and then can use it for online transactions,
without having to go through credit card verification for each
purchase. There will be other methods of electronic payments online
as well.
<P>
There are people who believe that the Internet may transform the
way that people buy goods and services at least to the same extent,
and possibly more, as happened with the advent of mail-order catalogs.
Almost any company that sells to the general public will certainly
want to use their intranet as a way to help market and sell what
they produce.
<P>
Doing this requires that a company use its intranet as well as
the Internet. In general, the intranet is used as a way to market
the goods and services, and the intranet is used as a way to let
people actually buy the goods. Today, almost any major company
you can name markets via the Internet, while few actually sell
anything.
<P>
To market what they produce, companies create Web sites on the
Internet, outside of the intranet's firewall. What most companies
have found is that if all they do is create an advertisement on
their Web site, they'll get very little traffic to their site.
Few people want to spend their time reading ads online. Because
of that, most businesses have found that they need to create compelling
content, such as entertainment clips, videos, sounds, and news
items. Once they draw people to their site, they can then market
their goods and services. Commercial Web sites have also found
that word of mouth isn't good enough to draw a crowd to their
sites. To ensure that people visit them, they advertise on other
Web sites. When someone clicks on an ad, they are immediately
sent to the Web site.
<P>
While a variety of content such as videos and audio clips may
draw people to a site, once people are there, businesses want
them to learn about their goods, and ideally to order them. Companies
build Web-based online catalogs that promote what is for sale.
These catalogs can be as simple as text listings of what's available,
or as complex as true multimedia catalogs that include sound and
animations. Many companies now have Web sites that include online
catalogs, such as L.L. Bean. In addition to catalogs, sites also
make available a searchable database of their goods and services,
so that people can target what they want to buy, and find information
out about it quickly.
<P>
Bringing customers to the site and showing them what is available
is only the first part of what a company wants to do. More important
is to close the sale over the Internet. That's the difficult part,
because many people still worry about performing financial transactions
over the Internet. However, secure ways of commerce are being
developed. At the point where someone actually places the order,
they will send information to the intranet. They may not know
that they've been transferred, but that's where their data eventually
goes. There are a variety of ways to pay online, although the
SET standard will undoubtedly become popular.
<P>
An intranet comes into play as well after the payment is made
and authorized. Since the customer has entered the information
about the products being ordered, there's no need for employees
to key in an order. The order can be sent over the intranet via
electronic mail or via a customized system to the fulfillment
department, where the goods are shipped.
<P>
Selling directly to consumers is only one way that business can
be done with intranets. Many billions of dollars are also spent
every year on business-to-business transactions, in which businesses
order goods and services from each other. In business-to-business
transactions, companies can directly communicate with each other
from intranet to intranet, sending data and orders between them
over the public Internet. Since much of that data is generally
confidential, there needs to be some way of keeping it from prying
eyes. The answer is to use Very Secure Private Networks (VSPNs),
a technology that allows intranets to use the Internet as if it
were a private, secure communications channel. It does this by
&quot;tunneling&quot; the private data through the intranet. See
<A HREF="ch20.htm" >Chapter 20</A> for more information about VSPNs.
<P>
For years, a technology called Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
has allowed companies to do direct business with each other electronically.
EDI allows businesses to fill out electronic forms and send them
to each other, and then have the receiving business act on those
forms. EDI is being brought to intranets and the Internet as a
way to speed business-to-business transactions. 
<P>
EDI is not the only way that companies can do business with each
other over intranets, however. Intranets can help companies do
business with each other in other ways as well. They can post
information about what kinds of goods and services they need,
and other companies can bid on providing them. They can use it
as a way to better communicate with contractors and with businesses
they buy goods from. In fact, intranets can help companies do
business with each other in so many ways, that there are many
people who believe that for many years, the main commercial use
of the Internet and intranets will be for business-to-business
transactions instead of for transactions between consumers and
businesses.

How Financial Transactions Work on an Intranet</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Intranets are used not merely to streamline businesses and make
them more effective, but as a place to do business as well-to
take orders for goods and services and to fill orders for goods
and services. In order for this to happen, though, a secure way
must be designed for credit card information to be sent over the
notoriously unsecured Internet. There are many methods for doing
this, but one standard, called the Secure Electronic Transaction
protocol (SET), will probably be the primary method used. It has
been endorsed by VISA, MasterCard, America Express, Microsoft
and Netscape, among other companies. It is a system that will
allow people with bank cards to do secure business over intranets.
This illustration shows how a transaction using SET might work.
<OL>
<LI>Mia visits a Web site that contains an electronic catalog.
After browsing through the catalog, she decides that she wants
to buy a camcorder. In order to use SET to pay for it, she will
have to have a credit card from a participating bank and have
been issued a unique &quot;electronic signature&quot; for her
computer that will be used to verify that it is she, and not an
impostor, that is making the purchase. In SET, everyone involved
in the transaction, including the merchant, needs to have electronic
signatures identifying them and software that supports the SET
protocol. SET also uses public-key encryption technology to encrypt
all the information sent among everyone involved in the transaction.
See <A HREF="ch17.htm" >Chapter 17</A> for details on encryption.
<LI>Mia fills out an order form detailing what she wants to buy,
its price, and any shipping, handling, and taxes. She then selects
the method she wants to use to pay. In this case, she decides
to pay electronically over the Internet, with her SET bank card.
At this point, she doesn't send her precise credit card number,
but instead the name of which credit card she wants to use. The
information she sends includes her electronic signature, so that
the merchant can verify it is really Mia who wants to do the ordering.
<LI>The merchant receives the order form from Mia. A unique transaction
identifier is created by the merchant's software, so that the
transaction can be identified and tracked. The merchant's SET
software sends back to Mia's computer this identifier along with
two &quot;electronic certificates&quot; which are required to
complete the transaction for her specific bank card. One certificate
identifies the merchant, and the other certificate identifies
a specific <I>payment gateway</I>-an electronic gateway to the
banking system that processes online payments.
<LI>Mia's software receives the electronic certificates and using
them creates Order Information (OI) and Payment Instructions (PI).
It encrypts these messages and includes Mia's electronic signature
in them. The OI and the PI are sent back to the merchant.
<LI>The merchant's software decrypts Mia's Order Information and,
using the electronic signature that Mia sent, verifies that the
order is from her. The merchant sends verification to Mia that
the order has been made.
<LI>The merchant's software creates an authorization request for
payment, and includes with the merchant's digital signature, the
transaction identifier and the Payment Instructions received from
Mia's software. The software encrypts all of it and sends the
encrypted request to the Payment Gateway.
<LI>The Payment Gateway decrypts the messages, and using the merchant's
digital signature verifies that the message is from the merchant.
By examining the Payment Instructions, it verifies that they have
come from Mia. The Payment Gateway then uses a bank card payment
system to send an authorization request to the bank which issued
Mia her bank card, asking if the purchase can be made.
<LI>When the bank responds that the payment can be made, the Payment
Gateway creates, digitally signs, and encrypts an authorization
message, which is sent to the merchant. The merchant's software
decrypts the message, and uses the digital signature to verify
that it comes from the Payment Gateway. Assured of payment, the
merchant now ships the camcorder to Mia.
<LI>Some time after the transaction has been completed, the merchant
requests payment from the bank. The merchant's software creates
a &quot;capture request,&quot; which includes the amount of the
transaction, the transaction identifier, a digital signature,
and other information about the transaction. The information is
encrypted and sent to the Payment Gateway.
<LI>The Payment Gateway decrypts the capture request and uses
the digital signature to verify it is from the merchant. It sends
a request for payment to the bank, using the bank card payment
system. It receives a message authorizing payment, encrypts the
message, and then sends the authorization to the merchant.
<LI>The merchant software decrypts the authorization, verifies
that it is from the Payment Gateway, and then stores the authorization
which will be used to reconcile the payment when it is received
as it normally is in credit card transactions from the bank.

Doing Business with Customers Using an Intranet</FONT></A></H2>

Intranets may revolutionize the way that businesses sell goods
and services. Using an intranet, a company can inexpensively market
its goods and services, take orders for them, and then fulfill
the order. This illustration shows how a record company called
CyberMusic could do business using an intranet.
<UL>
<LI>CyberMusic creates a public Web site on a bastion host in
the firewall of the intranet that it uses as a way to draw customers.
To get people to visit, it features interviews with musicians,
music news, concert calendars, music clips, and contests.
<LI>To further draw people to the site, CyberMusic advertises
its site on the Internet. When anyone clicks on an ad for CyberMusic,
they are immediately sent to the CyberMusic Web site.
<LI>When the person is done browsing, they go to the electronic
checkout counter to pay for the items they've selected. The CGI
shopping cart program sends a list of the cart's contents to the
checkout counter.  The buyer fills out a form that includes information
such as their name and address and method of payment. This information
is encrypted and sent from the Internet to the intranet through
the firewall. The transaction is a secure one because it uses
the SET protocol.  The orderer, merchant, and credit card company
then complete the payment following the illustration on the previous
page.
<LI>Information about the order is automatically transferred over
the intranet to CyberMusic's fulfillment department, which ships
out the records ordered.
<LI>The site features an electronic catalog that promotes the
records that CyberMusic sells. The catalog features music clips
so that people can sample records, and has information about the
album and its artist. To select an item from the catalog, someone
merely needs to click on a link or a button. When this is done,
the item is placed in their electronic shopping cart.  As they
browse through the catalog they can place more items in their
electronic shopping cart.  A CGI program on the CyberMusic Web
site keeps track of the contents of each individual's shopping
cart.
<LI>Instead of browsing through a catalog, people can do a focused
search on the kind of music they're interested in. They can search
by type of music, particular artist, date of release and other
terms. The search can be done via a variety of database searching
techniques, including CGI scripting and SQL technology, both covered
in earlier chapters. When they find the album they want to buy,
they need to click on a link or a button to drop the item in their
electronic shopping cart.

Business-to-Business Transactions Using Intranets</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Intranets can communicate with one another through the public
Internet, instead of by using private leased lines. Leasing private
lines can be very expensive, while using the Internet is inexpensive.
However, of vital importance when companies do business with one
another using in-tranets is that any transactions be kept private
and secure. Virtual Secure Private Networks (VSPNs) allow intranets
to communicate with one another over the Internet, while keeping
all data secure, by using &quot;tunneling&quot; technology. See
<A HREF="ch20.htm" >Chapter 20</A> for details on how VSPNs work.
<OL>
<LI>When a business wants to order goods from CyberMusic-such
as a music store called The Music Box-it contacts the CyberMusic
intranet using a VSPN. It can search through the database of CyberMusic
records to find the records it wants to order. A CGI program gives
them a special retailer's view of the data shown to regular customers.
<LI>As a further way to en-sure that the transaction is kept secure,
and that it is really The Music Box doing the ordering, a special
electronic &quot;token&quot; (like the digital signatures described
earlier in the chapter) may be required that proves that the purchaser
is indeed The Music Box. The token is sent over the VSPN.
<LI>When The Music Box finds the records it wants to order, it
fills out a form. This form may be customized specifically for
The Music Box, and will be different from the form used by the
general public, and by other companies that do business with CyberMusic.
<LI>Once it is verified that The Music Box is doing the ordering,
the transaction is put through using a secure payment system.
There are a variety of secure payment systems that can be used
for business-to-business transactions. One is de-scribed in &quot;How
Financial Transactions Work on an Intranet.&quot;
<LI>Information about the order is automatically transferred over
the intranet to CyberMusic's fulfillment department, which ships
out the records ordered.
<LI>CyberMusic can also do business with its suppliers and contractors
using an intranet. For example, it can post on its public Internet
Web server the fact that it is looking to buy raw, uncut CDs that
it will use in the manufacturing process, and have new suppliers
submit bids over the Internet. Established suppliers can connect
via a VSPN, and submit their bids which are then routed to the
appropriate people within the intranet.
