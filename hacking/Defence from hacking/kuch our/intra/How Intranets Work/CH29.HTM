How Intranets Can Cut the Corporate Paper Trail</A>
</UL>
<HR>
<P>
The typical corporation generates mounds and mounds of paper every
day-potentially many tons a year. This is bad for the environment,
costly for the corporation, and unnecessarily time-consuming because
it requires the company to hire people to maintain and keep track
of the paper trail. There are forms that have to be filled out
and handled, marketing materials, sales materials and brochures
to mail out, sales forms that need to be entered&#133;the list
can go on for a long time.
<P>
All this paper has many hidden costs-it's not merely the cost
of paper that is involved. There are a variety of overhead costs
as well. There are sky-high mailing costs. There are often high
costs for storing historical material. There is an even more pernicious
cost-paperwork causes red tape, and the handling of all that paper
slows down how a business can operate and can put it at a competitive
disadvantage.
<P>
While the &quot;paperless office&quot; has been talked about and
pursued for at least a decade, the advent of intranets can finally
bring it closer to reality. A combination of communications technologies,
Web publishing tools, workgroup applications, and e-mail can cut
down on paper costs, help slash mail costs, help eliminate administrative
overhead, and allow corporations to react more quickly to business
changes and deliver goods and services more quickly to their customers.
<P>
The area where paper costs can be cut most-and procedures most
streamlined-may be the sales and marketing department. In every
aspect of making a sale, from marketing and advertising through
making sales calls, to making the sale and then fulfilling the
order, paper costs and associated expenses can be cut. 
<P>
By posting marketing materials on the Web and drawing customers
to the site, companies can print fewer expensive marketing materials,
such as brochures. Many companies include Business Reply Cards
in their marketing materials that people can use to request additional
information. Business Reply Cards have many costs associated with
them: printing, mailing, and then fulfillment-inputting the person's
name into the computer system, then having someone mail out the
additional materials. On the Web site, customers can fill out
requests for materials. That request is automatically routed to
the intranet, where it is sent to the fulfillment department.
This cuts down on the printing and mailing costs that Business
Reply Cards carry, as well as input costs, since the customer
inputs the request, instead of someone employed at the company.
A traveling sales staff can input orders on an electronic form
on a laptop computer, and then later send that form back to the
intranet, again saving on paper and administrative costs. 
<P>
Internal paper costs can be cut as well. Company newsletters and
communications can be posted on an intranet Web server or sent
via e-mail. Personnel manuals can be posted as well. Forms for
doing things such as requesting time off can be filled out electronically
instead of on paper-again, cutting down on paper, overhead, and
red tape.

How Intranets Can Cut the Corporate Paper Trail</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
One of the many benefits of an intranet is that it can cut the
amount of paper and paperwork used by corporations, often dramatically.
It can streamline corporate procedures and have them done electronically,
instead of via paper. And it can also more directly communicate
with its customers without having to resort to paper and mailing.
Pictured here is an example of how a fictional record company,
CyberMusic, uses an intranet to cut paper costs.
<UL>
<LI>CyberMusic employs a sales staff to sell its records to record
stores and other outlets, and they carry laptop computers when
they travel. Formerly, in order to know the full stock of what
records the company carries, they would have to refer to printed
material, which easily became outdated. Now, they dial into their
company intranet, and access a Web page that contains the up-to-date
catalog. When they visit their sales accounts, they can link to
the page as well.
<LI>When the mobile sales staff takes an order, they previously
had to fill out paper forms, and then send those forms to the
data processing department, where the forms would be typed into
the sales system. With the advent of the company intranet, the
sales staff fills out an electronic sales form while on a sales
visit. The form is then sent via electronic mail to the company
intranet, where it is routed automatically to the fulfillment
and accounting departments. Previously, paper forms had to be
routed among all the departments, wasting time and money.
<LI>At CyberMusic, a great deal of paper material was generated
in sending brochures and related documents directly to customers.
CyberMusic has a public Web site, which cuts down on the number
of brochures sent out, since people can get information about
the company, its records and recording artists directly from the
Web. An added bonus is that customers can listen to sound clips
as well.
<LI>CyberMusic used to regularly include extra Business Reply
Cards in much of the material it mailed out, so that people could
request additional information about the company or its records.
Now, people can fill out a form on the company's Web site requesting
information, saving on paper and mailing costs. The information
is sent via a CGI script to the fulfillment department.
<LI>Personnel matters used to be handled solely by paper. Printing
and distribution costs were high. And when people wanted to take
vacations or time off, they would have to fill out a paper form.
This form would be sent to the personnel department, which would
check against a database whether the person had enough vacation
time, and then would type the information into a personnel system.
Now electronic personnel manuals are available online. And when
people fill out forms such as requesting vacations, they fill
out the form on the intranet themselves. Thanks to a CGI script,
they can search through part of their personnel records to see
how much vacation time they have left.
<LI>The company newsletter and other internal communications had
previously been mailed to every CyberMusic employee. Now the newsletter
is posted on an intranet Web server, and updated frequently, and
other kinds of communications are handled via electronic mail.
<LI>CyberMusic is an international corporation with branch offices
on every continent. When employees need to share memos, sales
reports, letters, and other printed materials, they used to be
sent via interoffice mail or via overnight express services- generating
tons of paper and costing a substantial amount of money. Now,
people send each other information, reports, and memos via intranet
e-mail.
