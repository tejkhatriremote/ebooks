How Firewalls Work</A>

<P>
All intranets are vulnerable to attack. Their underlying TCP/IP
architecture is identical to that of the Internet. Since the Internet
was built for maximum openness and communication, there are countless
techniques that can be used to attack intranets. Attacks can involve
the theft of vital company information and even cash. Attacks
can destroy or deny a company's computing resources and services.
Attackers can break in or pose as a company employee to use the
company's intranet resources.
<P>
<I>Firewalls</I> are hardware and software combinations that block
intruders from access to an intranet while still allowing people
on the intranet to access the resources of the Internet. Depending
on how secure a site needs to be, and on how much time, money,
and resources can be spent on a firewall, there are many kinds
that can be built. Most of them, though, are built using only
a few elements. Servers and routers are the primary components
of firewalls.
<P>
Most firewalls use some kind of <I>packet filtering</I>. In packet
filtering, a <I>screening router</I> or <I>filtering router</I>
looks at every packet of data traveling between an intranet and
the Internet. See <A HREF="ch13.htm" >Chapter 13</A> for more information on filtering.
<P>
<I>Proxy servers</I> on an intranet are used when someone from
the intranet wants to access a server on the Internet. A request
from the user's computer is sent to the proxy server instead of
directly to the Internet. The proxy server contacts the server
on the Internet, receives the information from the Internet, and
then sends the information to the requester on the intranet. By
acting as a go-between like this, proxy servers can filter traffic
and maintain security as well as log all traffic between the Internet
and the network.
<P>
<I>Bastion hosts</I> are heavily fortified servers that handle
all incoming requests from the Internet, such as FTP requests.
A single bastion host handling incoming requests makes it easier
to maintain security and track attacks. In the event of a break
in, only that single host has been compromised, instead of the
entire network. In some firewalls, multiple bastion hosts can
be used, one for each different kind of intranet service request.

Firewalls protect intranets from any attacks launched against
them from the Internet. They are designed to protect an intranet
from unauthorized access to corporate information, and damaging
or denying computer resources and services. They are also designed
to stop people on the intranet from accessing Internet services
that can be dangerous, such as FTP. 
<OL>
<LI>Intranet computers are allowed access to the Internet only
after passing through a firewall. Requests have to pass through
an <I>internal screening router</I>, also called an <I>internal
filtering router</I>or <I>choke router</I>. This router prevents
packet traffic from being sniffed remotely. A choke router examines
all pack-ets for information such as the source and destination
of the packet.<FONT COLOR=#FFFFFF>1</FONT>
<LI>The router compares the information it finds to rules in a
<I>filtering table</I>, and passes or drops the packets based
on those rules. For example, some services, such as rlogin, may
not be allowed to run. The router also might not allow any packets
to be sent to specific suspicious Internet locations. A router
can also block every packet traveling between the Internet and
the internal network, except for e-mail. System administrators
set the rules for determining which packets to allow in and which
to block.
<LI>When an intranet is protected by a firewall, the usual internal
intranet services are available-such as e-mail, access to corporate
databases and Web services, and the use of groupware.
<LI>Screened subnet firewalls have one more way to protect the
intranet-an <I>exterior screening router</I>, also called an <I>exterior
filtering router</I> or an <I>access router</I>. This router screens
packets between the Internet and the perimeter network using the
same kind of technology that the interior screening router uses.
It can screen packets based on the same rules that apply to the
internal screening router and can protect the network even if
the internal router fails. It also, however, may have additional
rules for screening packets specifically designed to protect the
bastion host.
<LI>As a way to further protect an intranet from attack, the bastion
host is placed in a <I>perimeter network</I>-a subnet-inside the
firewall. If the bastion host was on the intranet instead of a
perimeter network and was broken into, the intruder could gain
access to the intranet.
<LI>A bastion host is the main point of contact for connections
coming in from the Internet for all services such as e-mail, FTP
access, and any other data and requests. The bastion host services
all those requests-people on the intranet contact only this one
server, and they don't directly contact any other intranet servers.
In this way, intranet servers are protected from attack. Bastion
hosts can also be set up as proxy servers. See <A HREF="ch15.htm" >Chapter 15</A> for
more information about proxy servers and <A HREF="ch16.htm" >Chapter 16</A> for more information
about bastion hosts.
