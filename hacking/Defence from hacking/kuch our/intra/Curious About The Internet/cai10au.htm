<FONT SIZE=5><B>What If I'm Still Curious?</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H2>



<P>If you've read the preceding chapters, you're as well educated about the Internet as any non-Internet user can or should be. If you're still curious, that probably means you've decided to become a user&#151;or you're leaning that way.



<BR></P>



<P>This final chapter offers suggestions for your next step. The sources described here provide information or services that can expand your Internet expertise. The sources include these:

<LI>Online services

<LI>Computer and Internet magazines



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Internet books



<BR>



<BR></LI></UL>



<P>In keeping with the theme of this book, I have not included a directory of places on the Internet that can tell you more about the Internet. You should know, however, that they're there. In fact, you can find more information about the Internet on the 
Internet than anywhere else. It's a little hard to find, so we're caught in one of those chicken-egg paradoxes&#151;to get to the resources that can help you understand the Internet, you must already understand the Internet. That's just one of the 
speedbumps that will have to be flattened out somewhere between today's Internet and tomorrow's superhighway.



<BR></P>



<P>True beginners will do best to move on to more advanced paper-based material before attempting to cruise the Internet. However, for those brave souls who want to jump right in and see what they can find, I've thrown in a few words about getting 
Internet access, to get you started, under the heading, &quot;Hop Online.&quot;



<BR></P>



<P>Whatever you choose for the next step in your Internet education, I hope you'll discover that Curious About the Internet? prepared you well, enabling you to take on the more advanced material with ease.

<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>You can call or write the following organizations for more information about the Internet.



<BR></P>



<P>The Internet Society is the principle watchdog for the Internet's health and welfare. The all-volunteer organization doesn't control the Internet, but it helps keep the Internet running by determining technical standards for smooth network operation 
and recommending other policies. The Society publishes several newsletters and organizes conferences as well. It's the closest thing the Internet has to a central governing body, and it's the most authoritative source for up-to-the-minute Internet 
information.

<BR></P>



<P>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is an activist group that works to keep the Internet free, open, and uncensored. In providing assistance to people whose online free speech or other civil rights may have been violated, the EFF plays an 
important advocacy role in shaping the Internet's culture and evolution. The EFF has come under fire at times for defending mischievous hackers whom others have considered troublemakers not worth protecting. But as the Internet equivalent of the American 
Civil Liberties Union, the EFF helps hold a line between a free Internet and those who would seek to abuse or limit that freedom.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Consult an Online Service</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>For some people, using a commercial online information service such as those in the following list provides a good stepping stone to the bigger, more complex Internet. Think of these services as the Internet with training wheels.



<BR></P>



<P>At this writing, they don't offer the entire breadth of Internet services (though CompuServe promises to by the end of 1995), and they may or may not be more expensive, depending on whether you'd have to pay for your Internet connection&#151;see 
Chapter 5. But they're definitely easier to use. For a complete novice, a few months rooting around CompuServe or America Online is good preparation for Internet action. To the extent that they offer access to  Internet services, they are an even better 
transition vehicle.



<BR></P>



<P>If you really think your future lies with the Internet and nothing but the Internet, you may be better off reading up and then taking the plunge into the Internet proper, forgetting the middlemen. If you're not sure, however, consider using an online 
service to break the ice. Be sure to investigate costs carefully, the amount of Internet access provided, and whether Internet services cost extra.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Read a Magazine</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>Increasingly, you'll find regular or semi-regular coverage of the Internet in many consumer computer magazines, including PC/Computing, PC Magazine, MACWORLD, Computer Shopper, and even the relatively recent entry Family Computing. In their coverage, 
these magazines generally assume that you're familiar with the type of computers the magazine covers, but not especially familiar with the Internet.



<BR></P>



<P>If you already know your way around a computer, you may find insight in these publications and others like them. If you're a computer novice, though, you'll need to come up to speed on computers before you can appreciate what these publications say 
about the Internet.



<BR></P>



<P>At this writing, there are also two significant magazines that focus specifically on the Internet. In general, both require readers to possess an intermediate or better background in computers and online communication, although novices will find 
something interesting in either publication. The main difference between the two is that Internet World is more exclusively focused on the Internet and leans towards hands-on Internet information, whereas Wired covers the whole spectrum of electronic 
communications and is devoted mostly to issues and opinion pieces. Wired is also a hipper, slicker, snazzier publication than the more businesslike Internet World. Both publications regularly cover new or interesting resources on the Internet.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Hop Online</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>Feeling brave? This book has not attempted to fully prepare you to use the Internet. That doesn't mean that you can't just damn the torpedoes and try it out. After all, you don't need a license. I'd recommend that you first check out one of the books 
listed later in this chapter&#151;doing so would ensure a less frustrating learning curve. But you're the boss.



<BR></P>



<P>If you belong to a company or other organization that has its own Internet connection, you'll have to talk to your system administrator to find out how to get permission to use the organization's Internet account, which tools and facilities are 
available, and what your site's own Internet policies are. You may also want to ask a colleague who uses the Internet if you can peek over his or her shoulder for a lunch hour, to get a feel for how the Internet is used in your organization.



<BR></P>



<P>The fastest-growing type of Internet user is the individual or small business who acquires an Internet connection through an Internet access provider, as explained in Chapter 5. These providers typically supply either or both of the two types of 
&quot;dial-in&quot; service. The more powerful&#151;and usually more expensive&#151;option is a direct dial-in account, sometimes also described as an IP, SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol) or PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) account. This type of 
connection lets you take full advantage of software tools (see Chapter 5) that can make your Internet journey easier. For example, the popular Mosaic (see Chapter 7) requires an IP account.



<BR></P>



<P>You can also subscribe to the more basic terminal accounts (also called command line or &quot;shell&quot; account) some providers offer. Typically, these don't give you the ability to take advantage of the Internet tools you can run on your own 
computer&#151;you're limited to the tools running on the access provider's computer. Depending on what tools the access provider has, a command line or shell connection could be more difficult to use for a novice. Then again, some people find these 
connections easier to use, because you don't have to deal with configuring your software. Command line or shell connections may also require less powerful (and less expensive) computers and modems than the direct dial-in accounts.



<BR></P>



<P>If you don't have access through your organization, your first step in getting on the Internet is to choose an access provider. You can use a local provider in your area, or others around the country. If your non-local options don't offer toll-free 
numbers for accessing their computers, you'll pay long-distance charges in addition to the access provider's charges&#151;which is an important consideration.



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Did You Know.</B><B> </B><B>.</B><B> </B><B>.</B>



<BR>



<BR>Don't forget to consider Free-Nets or online information services (both described in Chapter 5) as alternatives to a more straightforward Internet connection.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>You may be able to find local access providers in the Yellow Pages or in local computer newsletters. If not, you can talk to your local computer club (ask them about Free-Nets, too) or society, or the folks at a local computer store. Lists of local and 
national providers and Free-Nets, and instructions for finding still more providers, appear in most of the books described later in this chapter.



<BR></P>



<P>When evaluating providers, consider the cost:



<BR></P>



<UL>



<LI>How much is charged per minute, and is there a monthly minimum?



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Is there an option to pay a flat monthly fee for unlimited access time? Would you use the Internet for enough minutes each month to make the flat rate a better deal than per-minute charges? Are there special restrictions attached to the flat fee, such 
as resources you can't use unless you pay an additional per-minute charge?



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Are there other charges to consider, such as long-distance charges for using a non-local provider?



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Are extra-cost Internet resources, like the ClariNet news service (see Chapter 6), included in the cost?



<BR>



<BR></LI></UL>



<P>You'll also want to carefully consider which tools the provider supplies, and how much, if any, software the provider gives you for an IP account. Usually, the software a provider supplies is shareware or freeware copied from the Internet anyway, but 
the provider is saving you the trouble of finding and configuring the stuff yourself. (Warning: If the provider gives you shareware, the software isn't really free. You're supposed to pay the programmer if you use it.) Find out how much telephone 
assistance the provider can supply, and whether it's free or not. Also, find out what type of computer hardware the provider requires or recommends for the type of account you're considering.



<BR></P>



<P>Once you find a provider, the next steps in gaining Internet access take place between you and the provider. Once you sign up, the access provider should give you complete instructions for getting onto the Internet through his or her service, and some 
instructions for any software supplied.



<BR></P>



<P>Bon voyage.
