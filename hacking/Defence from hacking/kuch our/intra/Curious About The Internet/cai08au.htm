<FONT SIZE=5><B>What Fun Do People Have on the Internet?</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H2>



<P>Read this chapter to satisfy your curiosity about how people fool around on the Internet. The answers include these:



<BR></P>



<UL>



<LI>They play interactive games.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>They play e-mail games.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>They try to win the Internet Hunt.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>They read the funnies.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>They play pretend in MUDs.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>They create their own WWW home pages.



<BR>



<BR></LI></UL>



<P>Of course, because most folks are fun-seekers by nature, any of the Internet resources discussed in other chapters may be a source of amusement or hilarity. In particular, newsgroups and e-mail (see Chapter 6) provide a link through which jibes and 
jokes can be exchanged. For example, there are several trivia newsgroups in which some users pose trivial questions and others try to answer. This newsgroup thus is also a game.



<BR></P>



<P>Although I've pointed out several times that the Internet's appeal is expanding to all walks of life, the fact remains that few people use the Internet for fun alone&#151;a fact that sets it apart from commercial services like Prodigy and America 
Online, which have many recreation-only users. When you are evaluating the level of fun on the Internet, expect no more than you'd find in any workplace where fun is permitted&#151;encouraged, even&#151;but stops before interfering with work.



<BR></P>



<P>As in most workplaces, the fun to be had on the Internet revolves around socialization. In many cases, it isn't so much the activity that's fun, but rather the fact that the participants know they're playing with interesting, new people from all over 
the world. Cool.



<BR></P>



<H3><A ID="I4" NAME="I4">



<FONT SIZE=4><B>They Play Interactive Games</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>Several different multiplayer games on the Internet can be played &quot;live&quot; between opponents who may sit thousands of miles apart. Typically, each player needs special software to play the game; in some cases, a player can get around this 
limitation by first accessing another computer that has the special software and then connecting to the game from there.



<BR></P>



<P>Players use Telnet or Gopher (see Chapter 7) to access the Internet site where a game is being played. They can then ask to play, in which case they'll be matched with other players who have also requested a game. People can also join as 
&quot;observers&quot; who watch games being played by others.



<BR></P>



<P>Traditional board games make good computer games because a computer screen effectively simulates the confined playing space of a game board. That's why much of the play on the Internet is in such games, including old favorites such as



<BR></P>



<UL>



<LI>Backgammon



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Chess



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Chinese chess



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Othello (also called Reversi)



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Bridge



<BR>



<BR></LI></UL>



<P>The computers running the games often provide some type of Talk or Chat facility (see Chapter 6) so that players can trade comments, tips, or questions and answers&#151;and, of course, find out about each other. That's especially exciting in the 
backgammon, chess, and bridge games, which are joined by some of the world's finest players.



<BR></P>



<P>But why should the Internet be limited to traditional games? It has several of its own, each designed to make better play out of the fact that the playing space is the Internet and not a folding card table in the basement. For example, there's a 
strategy game called Go. A two-player game, it's sometimes played in international tournaments featuring players from all over the world.



<BR></P>



<P>Another Internet game, Netrek, is a space battle for up to 16 players. Two teams of players try to take over each other's planets by slugging it out with fleets of spaceships. What's special about Netrek is that it shows good-looking pictures of the 
action on the screen. Most Internet games try to represent the game with simple letter characters, which is harder on the eyes but easier on computer and network horsepower.



<BR></P>



<H3><A ID="I5" NAME="I5">



<FONT SIZE=4><B>They Play E-mail Games</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>Besides the interactive games, the Internet has others played through the simple act of exchanging e-mail&#151;much as people have played long-distance chess matches through paper mail for hundreds of years. These &quot;play-by-mail&quot; games lack 
the interactivity and spontaneity of the other games, but because e-mail is their only requirement, they're open to all users of the Internet, regardless of what hardware and software they may have. However, note that some play-by-mail games are 
&quot;commercial&quot;&#151;that is, players must pay a fee to the folks who run the game.



<BR></P>



<P>There are many more, but here are some examples of popular play-by-mail games, culled from the play-by-mail FAQ (frequently asked questions) file, 



<BR></P>



<P>Adventurer's Guild (AG): a commercial fantasy arena combat game.



<BR></P>



<P>Arena: a free fantasy arena combat game.



<BR></P>



<P>Atlantis: a free strategic fantasy game.



<BR></P>



<P>Duelmasters (DM): a commercial fantasy arena combat game.



<BR></P>



<P>Galaxy: a free game set in space.



<BR></P>



<P>Legends: a commercial Dungeons &amp; Dragons-type simulation in which 200 players wander around a large map trying to become more powerful.



<BR></P>



<P>Middle Earth (ME-PBM): a commercial strategic simulation of J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy universe.



<BR></P>



<P>For programmers only, there's a nasty little game called King of the Hill, an Internet version of an old programmer's game called Code War. Using a special programming language, players write destructive little programs and send them by e-mail to a 
computer where they're run along with other players' destructive little programs. The winner is the one whose destructive little program is able to stop all the other destructive little programs and keep running. King of the Hill is like a demolition 
derby, with programs instead of cars.

<BR>As discussed in Chapter 7, Internet users can copy computer files from the Internet to their own computers. Among the types of files available are software programs, and among those are games. The free game software many people copy from the Internet 
and play on their computers is a major source of fun. The fun part isn't exactly on the Internet, but it certainly is from the Internet.



<BR></NOTE>

<H3><A ID="I6" NAME="I6">



<FONT SIZE=4><B>They Try to Win the Internet Hunt</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>The Internet Hunt is a test of users' Internet research skills. Every month, a new list of questions comes out, challenging players to answer them. The only rule is that players can't answer the questions from an encyclopedia, public library, or 
personal knowledge. They must apply their Internet research skills (like those described in Chapter 7) to find out where on the Internet the answers can be found. The questions from a recent Hunt appear in Figure 8.1.



<BR></P>



<P>Rick Gates, the creator of the Hunt, ensures that the information required to answer any Hunt question can be found somewhere on the Internet&#151;on a bulletin board, through a Gopher menu, in a newsgroup, in a file that can be copied_somewhere. The 
game helps players learn more about the Internet and sharpen their online research skills.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>They Read the Funnies</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>Through newsgroups and other resources, a variety of cartoon drawings are available on the Internet. Particularly noteworthy is Dr. Fun, a daily strip Internet users can see on the World Wide Web by using a graphical browsing tool like Mosaic (see 
Chapter 7).  The ClariNet service, an extra-charge set of newsgroups that feature news and syndicated columns, has also introduced a comic strip, Dilbert. 



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Really</B><B> </B><B>Curious?</B>



<BR>



<BR>As mentioned in Chapters 3 and 4, the corners of the mostly uncensored Internet hold a repository of X-rated stuff, including smutty newsgroup messages, filthy e-mail, computer files holding dirty pictures, and off-color online chats. One should note 
that although some of the material caters to pure adolescent prurience, other material qualifies as intelligent&#151;even literate&#151;adult erotica, including erotic fiction and poetry.



<BR>



<BR>Whether or not this hotly debated aspect of the Internet qualifies as fun depends on how often you tend to agree with Dan Quayle. Because some people do find it fun (not me! no sir!), it deserves a mention in this chapter.



<BR>



<BR>For more about newsgroups, e-mail, and chatting, see Chapter 6. For more about how files are copied, see Chapter 7.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>They Listen to the Radio</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>Talk radio has invaded every corner of American life, and the Internet is not immune. The Internet has, however, its own, unique variant on the model&#151;Internet Talk Radio.



<BR></P>



<P>As I pointed out earlier, advances in multimedia technology have made it possible to store pictures, video, and sound in computer files. Computers with the right multimedia hardware and software can &quot;play&quot; these files so that the user can see 
and hear their contents. The Internet Talk Radio program is a weekly radio show stored in computer files and made available on the Internet. Interested listeners copy the files (see Chapter 7 for more on copying files) and play them on their computers.



<BR></P>



<P>What's on? Internet Talk Radio offers interviews with important Internet folk and other technology movers and shakers, and news segments about Internet-related issues and events. The programs are mostly talk, but also they may feature music or sound 
effects. There are also messages from sponsors, who help pay for the program so it can be offered free on the Internet.



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Did You Know.</B><B> </B><B>.</B><B> </B><B>.</B>



<BR>



<BR>At the moment, Internet Talk Radio is the subject of some controversy&#151;not about its content, but about its technique. If you take a half-hour's worth of words, type them up, and send them out on the Internet in a text file, they can be copied 
quickly to a user's computer, they don't take much disk space on that computer, and the user doesn't need any special hardware or software to read them.



<BR>



<BR>Word for word, however, a sound file is much bigger than a text file. Take the same words and record them as sound, and you have a monster computer file (a whole set of files, actually) that takes a long time to copy (straining Internet resources) and 
requires a ton of disk space and special equipment on the user's computer. Why not, critics ask, simply publish the words as text instead of sound so that everybody can read them and the network isn't bogged down by the extra demands of sound files?



<BR>



<BR>It's a fair question, but it ignores the example of history. When people have access to new media for presenting old information, they gravitate to the new&#151;we went from books to radio, radio to TV, black and white to color, mono to stereo. Once 
folks have the ability to play sound and show pictures on their computers, they quickly lose interest in ordinary text&#151;never mind that the information may be the same. Multimedia is redefining what people expect from their computers, and the Internet 
will have to go along.



<BR>



<BR>In time, even more sound and pictures will be on the Internet. In the meantime, emerging technology that shrinks files and speeds up networks will carve out some room for all the new material.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>A companion show, the Internet Town Hall, works in the same way as Internet Talk Radio, but it features recordings of speeches and lectures given by politicians, scientists, and others. The speeches cover a variety of topics, including&#151;but not 
limited to&#151;technology. Users can select, copy, and listen to individual speeches from Internet Town Hall, whereas they have to copy whole programs from Internet Talk Radio.



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Did You Know.</B><B> </B><B>.</B><B> </B><B>.</B>



<BR>



<BR>Some readers might wonder what is fun in Internet Talk Radio. Let me point out that, other than the fact that it's often a fun show, the Internet Talk Radio's unusual trick of squeezing an audio program through the Internet is a bit fun, in and of 
itself.



<BR>



<BR>That's why Internet Talk Radio qualifies as fun, although the zillion other news and affairs resources on the Internet don't. In time, as sound becomes more common on the Internet and the novelty wears off, the criteria for &quot;fun&quot; will have 
to be redefined, and Internet Talk Radio will have to crank up its jollies to make the cut.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>They Play Pretend in MUDs</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>MUDs are online role-playing games in which multiple users interact within an imaginary environment and situation created through messages that appear on the screen. The name originally derived from &quot;Multi-User Dungeons,&quot; because the early 
MUDs borrowed their environment and rules from the Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing games, and many MUDs still use D&amp;D elements like knights and castles and sorcery. Lately, though, some users prefer the term &quot;Multi-User Dialog&quot; or 
&quot;Multi-User Dimension&quot; because the range of MUD environments has long since moved beyond D&amp;D and into more contemporary and realistic scenarios.



<BR></P>



<P>MUDs and related MUD-like resources are increasingly used as virtual reality scenarios for serious research applications. Scientists are using the basic MUD method to hold meetings in which they jointly interact with scientific data, such as 
astronomical observations, to make discoveries. MUDs are also used in sociological research to study how people interact with one another under different virtual circumstances.



<BR></P>



<P>MUDs are related to Internet Relay Chats (see Chapter 6) in that they enable users from anywhere to join in an online conversation. As with chats, users access a computer running MUDs, then select a &quot;room&quot; where a specific MUD is underway. 
MUDs differ from chats in that the conversation must be carried out within the context of the game&#151;a game with rules, strategies, and boundaries.



<BR></P>



<P>A player called the Wizard creates the environment through descriptive messages on-screen. Hundreds of MUDs are in action at any given time, and each has its own theme, set of circumstances, rules, and style.



<BR></P>



<P>Other players in the MUD respond to the situations and events the environment presents, and they interact with one another, commenting on the action, helping one another, or getting in each other's way. Mudders, as they're called, employ an elaborate 
code of words that allow them to manipulate the environment (throw, look, eat, go), interact with one another, move to other regions in the imaginary geography of the game (by typing compass directions), and even express emotions (e-mote). They also expand 
their range of expression with the &quot;smiley&quot; characters used in all Internet communication, such as the happy face :-) or the sad face :-(. To read the smileys, tilt your head to the left.



<BR></P>



<P>Most MUDs show text only. A few graphical MUDs do show pictures to users, but those are rare and users need special software to join in. There are also variations on the basic MUD. For example, there are MOOs (Multi-User Object-Oriented environments). 
MOOs are similar to MUDs except that the Mudders, not just the Wizard, can substantially modify the environment as they play. I've also seen MUSHes (Multi-User Shared Hallucinations), a real far-out MUD type in which the environments and the users operate 
on the far side of strange, which is how they like it.

<BR>Internet Relay Chats (see Chapter 6) are more free-form than MUDs, and they don't typically involve rules and role playing. Even so, they often center around a theme, and enterprising users have turned chats into elaborate games.



<BR>



<BR>For example, a bunch of actors and others interested in Shakespeare set up a chat room for making fun of Hamlet, cleverly called &quot;Hamnet.&quot; Participants in Hamnet join the chat at a scheduled time to give (or watch) an improvised performance 
in which they skewer the tale of the melancholy Dane by using the Bard's words sometimes and their own words at other times, depending on who has the funnier line. They jazz up performances with smileys and other Internet codes, make new jokes, and 
generally have a good time at Shakespeare's expense. Why not? Unlike most other butcherings of Shakespeare, this one's intentional.



<BR>



<BR>F.Y.I.: The name &quot;Hamnet&quot; is probably a play on &quot;Hamlet&quot; (and hammy actors) and &quot;network,&quot; but you should also know that Shakespeare had a son named Hamnet, who according to some accounts died shortly before Hamlet was 
written. Drama scholars have speculated that Hamlet was named for Hamnet, and that the play's treatment of father-son love and loss arose from Shakespeare's own grief. (This is the stuff you can learn only in an Internet book whose writer has a Theatre 
degree.)

<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>Using special software tools, Internet users can create their own home pages on the World Wide Web (WWW). The home page can show pictures and documents the user sets up, and can contain hypertext links that will take vistors to other pages in the WWW. 
Once the home page is set up, other WWW users can actually access a user's home page and check out what's there.



<BR></P>



<P>Many users apply this capability to serious purposes, such as making available the results of research they've done or creating handy lists of Internet resources for others to use. But other folks recognize that the same capability can be a source of 
good, goofy, exhibitionist fun. Users have set up home pages that show video of a tank of fish, animated clowns and priests, an animated robotic arm visitors can control, and more. As use of the WWW grows, more silliness is certain to follow.

<P>The Internet has more than enough fun available to keep users entertained until somebody walks in and makes them work. Among the major sources of fun are

<P>Bear in mind that other areas of the Internet&#151;particularly e-mail and newsgroups&#151;are vehicles for people to communicate. Although it is possible to communicate and have no fun (ever communicate with an insurance company?), many folks try to 
make their Internet communications a ball. They like to bring a little electronic levity into the lives of those with whom they trade messages, and maybe get some giggles in return. Communication may represent the most important source of fun on the 
Internet.
