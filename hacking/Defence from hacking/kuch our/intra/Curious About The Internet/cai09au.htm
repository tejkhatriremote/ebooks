<P>As you read, keep in mind that the record for predicting technology trends is lousy. In the mid 1960s, noted scientist and author Arthur C. Clarke thought we'd have a moon base before 2001. In the early 1980s, Microsoft founder Bill Gates predicted 
that there would be a PC in every American home by 1985. As of 1995, there's nothing on the moon but American flags, space junk, and Alan Shepherd's golf balls, and not even half of American homes are PC-equipped.



<BR></P>



<P>If Clarke and Gates&#151;both rich and famous for their prescience about technology&#151;can't accurately predict the future, what do you want from me? I'm not rich or famous. I did win $18 once in the Indiana lottery, but that was luck, I think.



<BR></P>



<P>Take what you read in this chapter with a grain of salt. Even so, if these predictions turn out to be wrong, the material in this chapter will equip you to understand what actually does happen, whatever that may be.

<P>Governments have long loved to labor at infrastructure because an efficient infrastructure supports the growth and prosperity of the state and also because infrastructure development is one of the few things governments can do without some knucklehead 
complaining it's not the proper role of government.



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Curious About the Word?</B>



<BR>



<BR>Infrastructure, according to Webster's New World Dictionary, is &quot;the basic installations and facilities on which the continuance and growth of a community, state, etc. depend, as roads, schools, power plants, transportation, and communication 
systems, etc.&quot; Politicians who promise to &quot;invest in the infrastructure&quot; usually mean they will fill all the potholes. But they could also fix up the schools, the subway, and the snow removal system; they could even get the public library an 
Internet account.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>Ancient Rome built roads so it could move goods (and armies) around its empire faster. The Greeks built piers so they could quickly move goods on and off ships, streamlining their lucrative international trade. Egypt built irrigation systems so people 
could eat better, which led inevitably to more people, hence more workers, hence more wealth for the Pharaohs. In the 1930s, Roosevelt's New Deal initiatives built hundreds of bridges and spread electricity and telephone service to rural America, in part 
to invent jobs but also to strengthen the national economy by making rural folks more active participants in it.



<BR></P>



<P>In the 1950s, a forward-thinking senator from Tennessee&#151;Albert Gore, Sr.&#151;was a big infrastructure fan. He championed the building of the federally funded interstate highway system, an investment that has returned its cost many times over by 
facilitating and encouraging interstate commerce, tourism, auto and gasoline sales, and many other economic windfalls in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Gore and other promoters of the highway system saw that middle America was evolving from a farming economy 
into a manufacturing economy, and that more Americans were becoming aggressive consumers of mass-produced goods. An efficient interstate system could move more stuff to more people more quickly and accelerate the upward economic spiral already underway to 
benefit both manufacturers and consumers.



<BR></P>



<P>It's not surprising, then, that Big Al's son&#151;Al Gore, Jr.&#151;(&quot;Mr. Vice President&quot; to you and me) has embraced the idea of a government-sponsored National Information Infrastructure, which he nicknamed &quot;The Information 
Superhighway&quot; to make sure everybody notices the historical precedent.



<BR></P>



<P>Just as proponents of the interstate system recognized and nurtured America's evolution to a consumer society populated by factory workers, Gore and others recognize an evolution to an information-based society, populated by knowledge 
workers&#151;people who work with information rather than concrete think. They think government should encourage the creation of a new &quot;highway&quot; system to nurture that evolution&#151;a high-speed highway for carrying electronic communication. The 
Internet may be an important part of making that happen.



<BR></P>



<P>Think about how people work today. More and more people spend their days at computer screens, performing desk-based, service-sector jobs, the fastest-growing type of job. The federal government says 60 percent of all U.S. workers are knowledge workers, 
and that 8 of 10 new jobs created in the next several years will be in information-intensive sectors of the economy. Feeding off that change is the rising number of &quot;telecommuters,&quot; people who do their jobs at home on PCs and communicate with 
their bosses, clients, or customers through telephones, fax machines, and modems. Tele-commuting is not only convenient for workers, but also may help society by reducing traffic, pollution, and fuel con-sumption.



<BR></P>



<P>Now consider how business is done today:



<BR></P>



<UL>



<LI>Companies rely on telephones, fax machines, and e-mail for their very survival.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>They do their accounting on computers and file their tax returns by sending the information through a modem to the Internal Revenue Service.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Their field personnel keep in touch though cellular phones and pagers, which rely on private satellite communications networks. More and more, they're also using notebook PCs and smaller hand-held computers that rely on the cellular phone networks to 
exchange orders, e-mail, and faxes with the home office, from anywhere.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Companies make and receive payments through Electronic Funds Transfer, a system that allows one company to transfer money directly from its bank account to another company's bank account&#151;no checks, no paper, and with instant verification. 
(Services such as Checkfree let consumers do the same thing&#151;make payments directly from their bank accounts without writing checks.)



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>When selling to customers, companies rely on the banking computer systems to verify and process credit card transactions&#151;another type of electronic payment.



<BR>



<BR></LI></UL>



<P>Although most businesses today depend on electronic communication for the operational needs I've just described, a growing number of businesses do their thing solely within the realm of cyberspace. They are in the business of supplying or manipulating 
electronic information, and little else. Among these are stock and commodities traders, bankers and other financial services providers, payroll processors, software companies, and companies that publish electronic information, like books on CD-ROM.



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Did You Know.</B><B> </B><B>.</B><B> </B><B>.</B>



<BR>



<BR>Some point out&#151;correctly, I think&#151;that if our economy depends too heavily on moving information and money around and not enough on manufacturing stuff, we're headed for a fall. But that's another issue, for another book. The Information 
Superhighway isn't about choosing an economic direction&#151;it's about supporting the one we've got, right or wrong.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>Finally, think about how we live when we're not working. We do our banking at automated teller machines (ATMs). We order products by telephone, using credit card numbers. About 60 percent of us get our TV entertainment through cables that run into our 
homes. And of course, many of us have PCs in our homes for home-office work, entertainment and education, and even the Internet.



<BR></P>



<P>All these trends in business and personal activity have one thing in common: they depend on electronic communication. The intensity of that electronic communication has caught us off guard. Nobody planned for it, and as a result, it's running on a 
rickety, outdated infrastructure, full of redundancy and limitations.



<BR></P>



<P>Why, for example, do we have two sets of communications wires running into our homes: one for the telephone, another for cable TV? How come the telephone line allows two-way communication, whereas the cable goes one way&#151;from them to us? How come 
it's so complicated to get an Internet account? Why can't you get an Internet account from the telephone company, just as you can get another telephone line or call-waiting? And where is this &quot;video on demand&quot; stuff we've been hearing about since 
the 1980s?



<BR></P>



<P>For businesses, the limitations are more serious. When communications lines are overloaded, communication slows down and becomes unreliable. The communications demands of business, however, have grown faster than anybody ever expected them to, and the 
infrastructure is perpetually overloaded. What's more, because our communications infrastructure was really built to carry telephone calls and not all this other stuff, there's a lack of standardization in the ways different computer devices, networks, 
companies, and countries communicate. That creates problems ranging from unreliable communication to no communication.



<BR></P>



<P>Looking ahead, it's obvious that we need to get our act together. We need a very fast, high-capacity, reliable, flexible, and affordable national communications network



<BR>so that businesses can keep growing and so that new,



<BR>communications-intensive products and services can be offered to a hooked-in public&#151;products and services such as interactive TV, video on demand, home shopping, home schooling, and more. Ideally, there would be a single high-capacity line 
running to every home, carrying reliable telephone service, TV, shopping, banking, information services, and more. That's what the National Information Infrastructure (NII) hopes to supply.



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Curious About the Word?</B>



<BR>



<BR>The formal name for Gore's pet project is the National Information Infrastructure (NII), and his nickname for it is Information Superhighway. You'll also hear the terms Infobahn, Infohighway, Infopike, Digital Highway, and others. It's all the same 
idea. Blame bored magazine writers.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>Sounds great, right? There's only one problem: Nobody knows quite how to build it.



<BR></P>



<P>Creating the NII will take more than just better wires&#151;although that's part of it. The NII will depend heavily on the high-speed, high-capacity fiber-optic cables that have been steadily replacing older copper telephone lines for more than a 
decade. Microwave and satellite networks will also play an important role.



<BR></P>



<P>Improved data compression technologies will be required to squeeze more information through the lines more quickly. Data will be compressed by the sender's computer, sent quickly across the network in its smaller state, then automatically decompressed 
on the receiver's computer. This will be especially important for transmitting video, which requires moving huge amounts of data very quickly. The methods used for compression will be standardized so that, for example, any brand of TV you can buy will know 
how to decompress and display the standard NII video signal.



<BR></P>



<P>Beyond providing the wires, there are other roadblocks. These are much more serious because getting through them requires people to agree with each another. The NII is being developed through two forces. First, the government has been incrementally 
legislating it into existence. The most important bill so far is the High Performance Computing Act of 1991, which created the National Research and Education Network (see Chapter 3), a corner of the Internet and a vehicle for experimenting with NII 
concepts on a small scale. There are many other bills also, some pending now, that together will define government's role in shaping the infrastructure.



<BR></P>



<P>The rest of the work is being done through cooperation among the major telephone and data communications companies, computer makers, cable TV providers, and other interested parties in the private sector. Together, they'll iron out the technical and 
operational issues governing how the NII will work: the rules for underlying communications technologies, the data compression techniques, the rules about how different types of data (voice, fax, video, sound) should be handled, and so on.



<BR></P>



<P>While working together on the infrastructure, they'll be working privately on the products that will take advantage of it. For example, the cable companies are developing video-on-demand and home-shopping systems that will allow cable subscribers to 
order a movie to watch immediately or, right from their TVs, to order products to be delivered by mail&#151;after the two-way superhighway lines replace the one-way cable lines.



<BR></P>



<P>The problem is that the NII partners are also competitors. For example, the telephone companies would like to use the highway to supply the same services the cable companies are working on, in addition to other services, such as videoconferencing and 
videophones. Who gets the job? Both? If both are allowed to offer these services, how can they cooperate effectively on designing a medium that they'll later fight over?



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Did You Know.</B><B> </B><B>.</B><B> </B><B>.</B>



<BR>



<BR>Designing the NII would be easier if companies were given monopolies on given types of services. Each company could independently design its own aspect of the NII its own way, and the whole thing would get built quicker.



<BR>



<BR>That's been tried before. In the 1930s, the government gave AT&amp;T a monopoly on telephone service so that the company would use its own money to expand the national telephone network. In the 1970s, the government gave cable companies regional 
monopolies so they'd use their own money to wire communities for cable TV. It then took the government half a century to reintroduce competition into the telephone industry, and even now Congress is fussing over how to introduce competitive forces into the 
cable industry.



<BR>



<BR>It appears that government has learned that it can't have its cable and eat it too&#151;so nobody's getting ownership of any portion of the NII. In fact, the recent National Communications and Information Infrastructure Act of 1993 lifted a 
10-year-old law that forbade telephone companies from going into the video transmission business. The same act requires the telephone companies to let competitors use their video system to offer competing products.



<BR>



<BR>The competition, in theory, is supposed to yield the best products at the best prices, and it may do that. It also slows progress on building the NII.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>Still other problems exist, including questions about whether the NII should be regulated or censored (and who should do the regulating), how international business can participate, and yet more problems as they come up. Even though government and 
private industry are cooperating in the design of the NII, it's unclear who will control the finished product. People are understandably concerned about the government controlling such a vital system. But is the control of private enterprise really any 
safer? (It's the same question as in the health care debate, and it will be at least as difficult to answer.)



<BR></P>



<P>Thus, despite all the buzz, a specific blueprint for the NII has yet to emerge&#151;the whole thing is a pipe dream, a good intention with few specifics to back it up. It's unlikely to be completed during the administration of Clinton and Gore, even if 
they serve two terms. Will the next administration grab the baton? Odds are, as long as companies like AT&amp;T and IBM are interested in the NII, whoever is in the White House will be, too. (Presidents tend to bend over backwards when the Fortune 500 
comes calling.) There's no guarantee, however, and incoming administrations have been known to pull the plug on the previous tenants' pet projects.



<BR></P>



<P>Because the NII is only half-baked, nobody knows whether it will ultimately build on the Internet, replace it, or ignore it. After all, the Internet did sort of happen by accident. It's a Frankenstein system, patched together out of the body parts of 
other networks. That's exactly what the NII folks want to move away from. They want to create a truly cohesive, elegant environment to maximize network performance, reliability, and efficiency. To accomplish that, the NII is likely to require that users 
(and their computers, TVs, telephones, and other devices) observe certain rules in their underlying technical communications. (The Internet has technical rules, too. But they're very broad, probably more broad than the NII's can afford to be.)



<BR></P>



<P>The NII will also effectively replace the traditional domestic telephone and data networks used by the Internet today. Gore is spearheading a campaign to get other nations to build a Global Information Infrastructure, so the international networks used 
by the Internet are likely to adopt technologies that match the NII's. We don't yet know what the technical requirements, costs, and limitations of the 



<BR>new networks will be. If they're built to accommodate a variety of communication methods and aren't too expensive, the Internet might go on as usual&#151;same computers and services, just a different network technology between them. At the moment, 
this scenario seems like the Internet's most likely future.



<BR></P>



<P>In fact, the NII could be the best thing that ever happened to the Internet. The emerging multimedia Internet resources (see Chapter 7) are horribly slow, mainly because of the limitations of the existing networks. The NII could open the floodgates to 
speedy, reliable multimedia computing on the Internet.



<BR></P>

<BR>



<BR>The NII may also enable you to use the Internet through your TV set. You'll learn about that later in this chapter.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>Of course, if the NII is too restrictive or expensive, the Internet may crumble because it requires access to open, affordable communications. There's also the possibility that new commercial services offered on the NII will prove attractive enough to 
draw away enough users that the Internet simply dies of neglect.



<BR></P>



<P>Then again, some look to the Internet as a potential model for the NII's design. In the spring of 1994, the National Research Council (NRC) issued a report recommending that the NII be patterned after the Internet in several important respects. Most 
important was preserving the Internet quality of &quot;openness&quot;: the ability to accommodate many different types of data and applications.



<BR></P>



<P>The report cautions that, when big companies build communications networks, they tend to build in limits that favor their own products. To prevent that from happening, says the report, the companies involved in the NII should be split into two 
independent groups&#151;one responsible for building an open, flexible network suited to limitless applications, and another to develop services to be offered on that network. The report also recommends that the government keep a close eye on the 
developers to make sure they don't shut out important academic, research, and non-profit services&#151;like those on the Internet&#151;in the headlong rush to supply for-profit services.



<BR></P>



<P>Of course, whether the government really intends the NII as a tool for the public good or as a profit center for big business remains debatable. On the one hand, Gore's speeches stress NII's value to homes and schools (more about that later). On the 
other hand, in early 1994, President Clinton formed the Advisory Council on the National Information Infrastructure to help design and promote the NII. To whom does the council report? The Secretary of Commerce.



<BR></P>



<H3><A ID="I5" NAME="I5">



<FONT SIZE=4><B>The Internet Is Headed into Business</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>Should the NII shape up as planned, it would be a boon to business. Gore has already labeled his highway project the most important and lucrative marketplace of the twenty-first century. Business will use the NII for improved interbusiness 
communications&#151;videoconferencing, for example&#151;and to offer profitable new products and services, such as online shopping and the others described in this chapter.



<BR></P>



<P>Some proponents also tout the many new jobs that will be created to build and manage the NII and its products; but that's a red herring. For all anybody knows, those jobs will be offset by jobs lost in other industries. For example, if online shopping 
catches on, traditional retail sales jobs may dwindle.



<BR></P>



<P>While they wait for the superhighway, businesses are cutting their electronic teeth on the Internet. As discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, business use of the Internet is a controversial subject. Some die-hard Internet people are dead-set against it. But 
the anti-commercial contingent is fighting a losing battle. More than half of the Internet's users are business people, and their proportion is growing. Whether the Old Guard likes it or not, the Internet is becoming a marketplace.



<BR></P>



<P>The types of Internet resources used by the greatest number of businesspeople are intercompany e-mail and business research, both of which are used with growing fervor. The



<BR>e-mail and file transfer capabilities are increasingly applied to the formation of &quot;virtual corporations,&quot; temporary business alliances put together for a given project (see Chapter 3). But the once restricted activities of online 
advertising and selling are growing even more rapidly. Companies advertise quietly on newsgroups as a way to efficiently target a specific interest group. Also, companies are taking advantage of the World Wide Web (WWW&#151;see Chapter 7) and its 
multimedia power to advertise with pictures of their products.



<BR></P>



<P>This practice is becoming especially common on the computers of the companies that sell Internet access. Because their clients must &quot;dial-in&quot; (see Chapter 5) to the company's computer and branch from there to the Internet, the company has a 
chance to show the user ads before he or she even ventures out on the Internet. For example, consider what I see when I first fire up Mosaic (see Chapter 7) to venture out on the WWW. My Internet access provider shows me a screen like the one in Figure 
9.1.



<BR></P>



<P>



<BR><B><A HREF="09cai01.gif">Figure 9.1.</A> A screen shown by an Internet access </B><B>provider who sells ad space on screens that its clients see before they </B><B>jump into the Internet.</B>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Did You Know.</B><B> </B><B>.</B><B> </B><B>.</B>



<BR>



<BR>Most Internet users have acquiesced to the inevitable expansion of commercial Internet applications. Nevertheless, they're quick to remind



<BR>advertisers that Internet users have the power to combat excessive, saturation-type advertising practices.



<BR>



<BR>The best illustration is the now infamous Green Card Incident. Attracted by the Internet's ability to broadcast cheaply a message to millions of users simultaneously, husband and wife law firm Canter and Siegel wrote a small computer program to post 
an ad automatically to nearly every Internet bulletin board. (The ad offered their legal services to help aliens get green cards). Mass-posting of this type is called &quot;spamming&quot; by Internet folk, a term meant to evoke an image of something that 
insidiously multiplies and spreads in all directions. Depending on whom you ask, &quot;spamming&quot; derives either from an old Monty Python routine in which the lads in drag sing the word spam repeatedly, or from the image of a hunk of Spam falling into 
a spinning fan.



<BR>



<BR>Spamming is an Internet no-no under any circumstances, and a double no-no when you're selling something&#151;it's the Internet equivalent of junk mail. Outraged Internet users responded to Canter and Siegel's ad with flames, vicious e-mailings meant 
to punish the spammers. Some users even spammed the spammers, dumping thousands of duplicate messages into Canter and Siegel's mailbox. The flames grew so hot that they overloaded the computer of the lawyers' Internet access provider, who was forced to 
cancel their account to keep the system running.



<BR>



<BR>The message was received, to be sure, but although the Green Card Incident demonstrates the power of enraged Internet users, it also proves their impotence. Canter and Siegel told the New York Times that their ad still drummed up $100,000 in business, 
and their book about the experience is getting an initial 100,000-copy press run. The pair has promised they'll advertise on the Internet again. Checkmate.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>On the Internet, there is even a large network dedicated to commercial use, the Commercial Internet Exchange (CIX). Like a bizarre bazaar, CIX carries a range of ads and also offers online shopping services. Online shopping services (see Figure 9.2) 
provide on-screen descriptions or pictures of products that Internet users can purchase simply by supplying their names, addresses, and credit card numbers. As these services grow in popularity, they will ultimately shift over to the NII, where they will 
be offered through TV to reach an even larger consumer market (see more later in this chapter).



<BR></P>



<P>



<BR><B><A HREF="09cai02.gif">Figure 9.2.</A> Online shopping.</B>



<BR></P>



<P>Working now on how those services will operate is CommerceNet, a consortium of more than 40 computer companies, banks, retailers, and other companies. Funded by the federal, state, and local governments and by the member companies, CommerceNet is 
chartered to come up with better methods for performing online basic consumer tasks, such as finding products and services, ordering them, paying for them, and arranging for their delivery.



<BR></P>



<P>To ensure that the services catch on, CommerceNet is focusing on making these services easy-to-use and accessible to anyone. The companies are also trying to resolve the thorny issue of online privacy (see Chapter 4) to make sure that transactions and 
credit-card numbers remain confidential.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>The Internet Is Headed into the Classroom</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>As described in Chapter 2, the Internet is already used by most universities to exchange information and offer enhanced resources&#151;including actual online classroom sessions&#151;to students and faculty. It's also making inroads in high schools and 
grade schools as an important teaching tool. Not only does the Internet offer access to people and information around the world, but also it makes students comfortable and proficient with computers. In his NII stumping, Gore has often stressed that our 
education system needs to emphasize computer skills in order to produce workers with the skills to keep America competitive in the twenty-first century.



<BR></P>



<P>Unfortunately, just as we've learned that our kids need better schooling, the resources to accomplish that are dwindling. The 1980s legacy of tax-consciousness has led many people to support cuts in education spending.



<BR></P>



<P>That leaves many school systems with the challenge of improving education without spending a lot of money. One way is to exploit computers and communications lines to provide distance learning, which means simply that students use their computers to 
participate in lessons actually going on somewhere else.



<BR></P>



<P>For years, educators have recognized the computer's value as a teaching tool. A computer has infinite patience and can repeat lessons as often as needed. Students pay attention to computers, in part because they enjoy the interactivity and in part 
because they've been conditioned to watch TV screens and have been raised on Nintendo.



<BR></P>



<P>Now consider the value of coupling that computer affinity with high-speed communications. Given the NII's ability to carry voice, video, and any other multimedia information, school kids in a Boston classroom can experience a lesson being given in 
Seattle or maybe London. Because the NII will support two-way communication, students will be able to ask questions and interact with their distant teachers and fellow students.



<BR></P>



<P>Not only does this open a way for schools to save money by sharing teachers and other resources, but also it improves education, allowing kids everywhere to benefit from the best teachers, wherever they may be. Imagine a high school Spanish class in 
Illinois getting a lesson from a teacher in San Juan or Madrid. Envision science classes all over the country interacting &quot;live&quot; with astronauts on the space shuttle or with archeologists in the field&#151;it's like a daily field trip. The same 
technology may also allow homebound kids or those who live in remote areas to study from home.



<BR></P>



<P>Using the same technology, students can share not only teachers and lessons but also resources such as online textbooks. Some have cautioned that because distance learning requires computers, it will tend to be used first in the well-funded schools 
that need it least and won't be available in poorer school districts &#151;widening an already unacceptable inequity in public education. With luck, public and private funds will be found to make sure 



<BR>everybody gets an equal chance to get online. The potential savings in staff, textbooks, and other resources may also help struggling schools get online.



<BR></P>



<P>All of these educational services are available today, in a limited fashion. The promise of the NII is that it will extend these benefits to millions of students. To the extent that they can be made affordable and accessible to schools, such services 
can save money and improve education at the same time.



<BR></P>



<H3><A ID="I7" NAME="I7">



<FONT SIZE=4><B>The Internet Is Headed into Your TV</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>The more you look at all the proposed Superhighway benefits and services, the more you realize that the NII and its related projects are part of a move to unify all the ways we communicate electronically, cutting out the overlap.



<BR></P>



<P>Sooner or later, many people may realize that there's a wasteful redundancy in owning a PC and a TV. Why not just have one big screen where you can watch HBO, do your taxes, and play video games? Why can't the video cable double as a modem line, so 
your TV can go online?



<BR></P>



<P>That's the future some envision. Although not all visionaries think it will happen this way, others promote the concept of a PCTV&#151;a PC and TV in one. It would probably look like a regular TV. Inside, however, it would have the 
&quot;intelligent&quot; processing power of a PC, and it would be accompanied by some kind of keyboard&#151;maybe a fancy remote control or even a &quot;voice interface&quot; that would allow the user to control it by voice commands. At first, people would 
probably purchase &quot;set-top boxes&quot; that would convert a regular TV to a PCTV; but eventually, all new TVs would be built as PCTVs.



<BR></P>



<P>Using the household NII line as a combined, two-way cable TV and modem line, the PCTV would be the required end-user device for enjoying the following services:



<BR></P>



<P>Interactive TV: Like your telephone service today, your cable TV would be supplied by a two-way line. TV programs would come to you as before, but you could talk back to them by keying in responses or messages with your remote control. The favorite 
illustration for interactive TV is Interactive Jeopardy, in which you could press buttons on your remote control to send in your answers (or rather, your questions&#151;&quot;Alex, I'll take 'Homophones' for $100.&quot;) Other possible applications include 
interactive talk shows. As with some other NII plans, an early version of Interactive TV is already available in some places. The NII promises to greatly refine and expand what's available now, and extend it to everyone. 



<BR></P>



<P>Shopping: Your two-way TV could become a shopping mall through which you order products and services. Unlike today's Home Shopping Club-type programs, interactive shopping would allow you to search actively for what you want, instead of waiting for the 
Home Shopping folks to show it. For example, to find that nice T-Fal cookware set, you might choose &quot;cookware&quot; from an on-screen menu, then choose



<BR>&quot;T-Fal&quot; from the menu that appears next, after which you'd be shown pictures of sellers' wares and maybe even see a salesperson give a video pitch. When you're ready to buy, you do so by pressing a button or two on your remote. The video 
seller bills the item to your credit card or takes the money out of your bank account, then tosses your T-Fal in the mail.



<BR></P>



<P>Video-On-Demand: The NII is supposed to be able to accommodate 500 channels of TV programming. If you have cable, you know that you could have 1,000 channels and still find nothing to watch but info-mercials, cheesy talk shows, and reruns of 
Congressional speeches. So, instead of going to the video store to rent a tape or laserdisc, you'd tap your remote to order a movie or other program to watch immediately. You might pick your movie from an on-screen menu or from a catalog. The video company 
would transmit the movie (or TV show, educational video, or other program) to your TV and charge your credit card or bill you for each movie. Early versions of this technology are already available through digital satellite systems. The NII versions, 
however, are likely to be more powerful, allowing you to pause, rewind, and fast-forward your program. NII-based cable is also expected to supply High-Definition Television (HDTV), a new video standard that will supply pictures that look as good as a movie 
screen on new HDTV sets.



<BR></P>



<P>Other Information Services: Remember, your PCTV will have many of the capabilities of a PC, some kind of remote keyboard control, and access to a high-speed, two-way communications line. That means it could be used to access the Internet or any of the 
other online services in use today. Because the PCTV would bring these services to many people who aren't Internet users (or even computer users), highly simplified services would soon appear. They would provide easy menus or voice prompts to lead users 
through simple tasks like looking up information in an online encyclopedia. Interactive banking is another likely service. You'll be able to check your balance, transfer money, and pay bills through your TV.



<BR></P>



<P>Other consumer-oriented, interactive consulting services are likely to appear, as well. You can dial up some personal tax advice or consult a lawyer, podiatrist, or psychic. You may be able to run software programs, but how you'll do it is up in the 
air. Your PCTV may have a disk or CD-ROM drive like a regular PC, or you may simply punch in a request to use software that's stored not on your TV but on the computer of the service provider, who would send it to your PCTV like an on-demand video.



<BR></P>



<P>Of course, some people doubt that the future will unfold exactly this way. Even after major portions of the NII are in place, most of us will still probably have separate telephone and cable lines for years. The difference is that the one-way cable 
lines will be switched to two-way, and the telephone lines will also offer video. The PCTV idea also may not happen all at once. Although most experts agree that the services I've described will be offered, PCTV scoffers say the more likely scenario has 
everyday consumers using a more simplified type of interactive TV set to use basic services like video-on-demand and shopping, whereas NII services involving more skill and more keyboard work will still require a PC of some kind.



<BR></P>

<FONT SIZE=4><B>The Internet Is Headed into Oblivion (Maybe)</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>If the information superhighway really shapes up, would it replace the Internet? That's not the goal of the NII by any means, but it could have that effect.



<BR></P>



<P>Whether the NII can or will replace the Internet is hard to say exactly, because as a formal organization the Internet doesn't actually exist. That is, given that an essential defining quality of the Internet is the fact that it isn't a formal 
organization, does the existence of a commercially or federally managed infrastructure make the Internet, as we know it, impossible?



<BR></P>



<P>Look at it this way:



<BR></P>



<UL>



<LI>If you think of the Internet as the sum of its resources, it will probably survive in one form or another. Whatever the new networks are called, people will almost certainly still have access to newsgroups (or reasonable facsimiles), files to copy, 
e-mail, and the rest. These may be direct holdovers from the Internet, or they may be commercial or public descendants of those resources. Some of the specifics of the resources may change as well&#151;but left alone, they'd still evolve, all by 
themselves.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>If you think of the Internet as a unique cultural and social phenomenon, your Internet may be disappearing. To the extent that Internet-type resources survive, there's no guarantee that any of them will be free. Charges would almost certainly skim off 
a proportion of current Internet users, whereas the easier access provided by interactive TV would bring in new users who wouldn't have touched the old Internet with a 10-foot modem cable. This would change&#151;and perhaps limit&#151;the spectrum of 
people and personalities on the network. It's possible that small, rebel networks would evolve to preserve the spirit of the Internet in the age of the NII, but these would lack the breadth that was an essential characteristic of the original Internet.



<BR>



<BR></LI></UL>



<P>Although no one knows exactly what will happen, some fear that the involvement of government and business interests in the NII will&#151;either by regulation or by market forces&#151;effectively censor or skew the information exchange, as with other 
mass media, toward whatever conforms to the prejudices of the majority or the special interests of business and government.



<BR></P>



<H3><A ID="I9" NAME="I9">



<FONT SIZE=4><B>So Now You Know.</B><B> </B><B>.</B><B> </B><B>.</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>Now you know the ropes, the lay of the land, the bottom line, the basic picture, the overall facts about the Internet. In this chapter, you've learned that the Internet is evolving into an Information Superhighway (or being replaced by it, depending on 
how you look at it). If it lives up to its promise, the Superhighway&#151;formally called the National Information Infrastructure&#151;will offer_



<BR></P>



<UL>



<LI>Enhanced business communications services.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Improved multimedia educational services.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Interactive video and video on demand.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>New information services, such as home shopping and banking.



<BR>



<BR></LI></UL>



<P>You also know that the National Information Infrastructure is far from a reality, and the open question of who would control it&#151;government or private enterprise&#151;is a source of much controversy. Internet aficionados would suggest a third 
alternative&#151;an NII controlled by no one, just as the Internet is. But considering that government and private enterprise are building the NII out of their own pockets, they're extremely unlikely to turn it loose when they finish.
