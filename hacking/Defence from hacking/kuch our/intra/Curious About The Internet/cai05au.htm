<P>As you know, this book is not called Wanna Learn How to Use the Internet?. True to its title, this book makes no effort to provide a &quot;hands-on&quot; guide to using the Internet, but rather it offers a concise guide to what the Internet is and why 
it's important, all to satisfy the curiosity of people who may go on to become users and of people who may not.



<BR></P>



<P>We've come to a point, though, where both future users and future non-users can benefit from a quick rundown of the general equipment, skills, and services using the Internet demands. If you're giving any thought to joining the Internet fold, this 
chapter should give you enough information to determine whether ramping onto the Internet is right for you. You may find it's all easier than you imagined. Then again, you may find that between you and the Internet there are financial, educational, or 
practical hurdles that aren't worth jumping.



<BR></P>

<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>As the Introduction pointed out, the Internet is now undergoing an image transformation similar to the one that redefined computers in the 1980s. (There's more about the Internet's evolution in Chapter 9.)



<BR></P>



<P>Before the pioneering personal computer work of Apple Computer, IBM, and others, computers were tools for business and science&#151;period. In the public mind, computers had no purpose beyond that, and they required too much money and technical skill 
to be practical for other applications. PCs changed all that by redefining (in a transformation that's still underway) the computer as a consumer product&#151;something anyone can use to speed and simplify everyday tasks, something that should be in every 
home for education and for play, something equivalent to a large, expensive toaster. Much of the mainstream press coverage has supported a similar transformation of the Internet from a complex tool of science into a consumer playland of online shopping, 
e-mail pen pals, and free software.



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Curious About the Word?</B>



<BR>



<BR>Online describes the condition of something while on a network. While one is in the act of using the Internet (or any computer network), one is online. When not using the network, one is offline. Both words are so new that you'll sometimes see them 
hyphenated, on-line and off-line.



<BR>



<BR>Lately, the word online has been used as an adjective to describe resources available on a network like the Internet or CompuServe&#151;themselves known as online services. Online shopping is a way to read about and order goods through a network. 
Online news-letters (also called electronic newsletters) can be accessed over a network and read right from the computer screen.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>For any consumer product, there's a marketing campaign aimed at making everyone feel unable to live without it&#151;and the Internet's no different. Through the next few years, you'll be sent this message repeatedly: Get online. Don't miss out. 
Everybody has it but you. People who use it have more sex than people who don't. Hurry.



<BR></P>



<P>So before you begin to learn how to get set up for the Internet, ask yourself The Big Question, the one marketing people really hate: Do I need it?



<BR></P>



<P>In the first four chapters of this book, have you seen anything that specifically makes the Internet an attractive tool for your profession or a terrific toy for your play? Is there a bulletin board that offers information or discussions about your job 
or hobby? Are there people with whom you'd like to exchange e-mail, and are they on the Internet? The answer is important, because using the Internet may require a significant amount of money (for computer hardware or an Internet connection), time, and 
trouble, as you'll discover in this chapter. If you don't really have anything to gain, don't let yourself be sold.



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Really Curious?</B>



<BR>



<BR>Chapters 1 through 4 provide a good overview of the types of resources available on the Internet. Even so, a book this short can only generalize about the whole range of available resources. If you think that the Internet may offer some resources of 
special interest to you, try to find out whether such resources exist&#151;and just how valuable they are&#151;before taking the Internet plunge.



<BR>



<BR>Unfortunately, the best way to find out what the Internet offers is to get online and consult some of the resource directories available there. Perhaps you have a friend who is already on the Internet and who can spend an hour online hunting down 
resources while you peer over his or her shoulder. Your local public or university library may also help you in this way.



<BR>



<BR>Also, companies that sell Internet connections (see  &quot;It Takes a Communications Hookup&quot;) may be willing to track down some resources for you in order to entice you to sign up. Some of these companies also offer free trial periods; if you 
already own the equipment required to use the Internet (see &quot;It Takes a Properly Equipped Computer&quot;), you can try it out long enough to find out whether it's for you. If not, you can cancel your connection before the free trial runs out, and 
you've spent nothing but time.



<BR>



<BR>Failing that, there are &quot;offline&quot; ways to find out what the Internet offers you specifically. For example, you can contact your professional organizations and associations; they may know about Internet resources used by others in your field. 
You can also consult a book such as Navigating the Internet or Your Internet Consultant, both described in Chapter 10.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>While you're musing, you should be aware that much of what the Internet offers is available without the Internet. For example, if all you want is e-mail, commercial providers such as MCI Mail enable you to exchange messages with Internet users, as do 
the e-mail facilities offered by online services such as CompuServe, America Online, and Prodigy.



<BR></P>



<P>The online services also offer a variety of special-interest bulletin boards and news services, and they offer what they call &quot;gateways&quot; to the Internet, which allow users some ability to use the Internet from within the online service. 
Capitalizing on the publicity surrounding the Internet, each service is trying to position itself as the best and easiest way to get to the Internet.



<BR></P>



<P>For example, America Online&#151;a relative newcomer to online services whose selling point is ease-of-use&#151;offers easy access to some selected Internet resources and to newsgroups (see Chapter 6), with a promise to add more services soon. That's 
not the whole Internet by a longshot, but it's a start, and it's made simpler by America Online's easy-to-use menus. CompuServe announced in September of 1994 that it will incrementally roll out access to various Internet resources throughout 1995, with 
full Internet access scheduled to be available from within CompuServe by the end of that year. The service is also working on ways to make using Internet resources easier to use when accessed through CompuServe.



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Really Curious?</B>



<BR>



<BR>The precise terms and limitations of the gateways between the Internet and the online information services are changing rapidly at this writing. If you want to evaluate an online service's Internet access, contact the service for more information.



<BR>



<BR>You can find contact information for America Online, CompuServe, and Prodigy in Chapter 10.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>Note that Internet users can reach CompuServe through the Internet, as well, through a facility called Telnet (see Chapter 7). When they do, they have to supply billing information before entering CompuServe so they can be charged like regular 
CompuServe subscribers. Internet users can send e-mail to CompuServe subscribers, as well. In that case, CompuServe has no way to bill the Internet user, so it charges a special fee to the CompuServe user who receives the message. CompuServe is even adding 
its own page to the World Wide Web, a growing part of the Internet (see Chapter 7). At this writing, CompuServe is still working out how it will bill the Internet users who will access its World Wide Web page.



<BR></P>



<P>Because they are self-contained and professionally managed, online information services are much easier to use than the Internet, and they may or may not be cheaper, depending on what your options are for getting your own Internet connection (see 
&quot;It Takes a Communications Hookup&quot;). For many, they make a good set of training wheels before riding off to the Internet.



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Did You Know.</B><B> </B><B>.</B><B> </B><B>.</B>



<BR>



<BR>Remember that many of the resources on the Internet weren't created for the Internet alone. They were created for the use of some organization and then made available to others through the Internet.



<BR>



<BR>Because of that, some resources available on the Internet are also available without the Internet or any other network. For example, you can reach the White House's information system through the Internet, but you can also contact it directly through 
telephone lines from a properly equipped computer. You leave the Internet out of the process entirely. Ditto for many university libraries and other resources.



<BR>



<BR>Before you acquire an Internet connection to use one or more specific resources, investigate whether those resources are available without the Internet. They may be easier to get to, and cheaper, without the Internet's help.



<BR></NOTE>

<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>Those whose companies or schools supply them with Internet access don't have to think about this one&#151;they use whatever is offered. Typically, they have a PC or computer terminal connected through a small network to a main computer called a host. 
The host is what is actually connected to the Internet. What the user can do on the Internet is limited to what the host is set up to do.



<BR></P>



<P>For these users, the best resource about the Internet is their own organization's system administrator, who can fill them in on the specifics of the organization's Internet connection and its capabilities. (Such users could benefit greatly, however, by 
reading the remainder of this book before talking to the system administrator. The administrator will seem to make much more sense and will also seem less impatient when talking to an informed user.)



<BR></P>



<P>Those thinking of setting up their own Internet connection need to know which kind of computer to use and what else they'll need to get connected. In theory, all that's required is any personal computer equipped with a modem, but it's not quite that 
simple.



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Curious About the Word?</B>



<BR>



<BR>A modem is a device that allows a computer to communicate with another computer over the telephone lines. Both computers must be equipped with modems in order to communicate.



<BR>



<BR>A modem can be built into the computer (an internal modem), or it can be a small box that is plugged into the computer through a cable (an external modem). In either case, the telephone line from the wall plugs into the modem, just as it would 
otherwise be plugged into a telephone. (There are also wireless modems that use the same cellular networks used by car phones to communicate with other computers.)



<BR>



<BR>Modems come in different speeds. Slower modems make using the Internet more difficult because the user may wait an annoying length of time for the slow modem to send commands and messages to the Internet; the user may then wait some more for the 
Internet's response. Also, copying computer files from the Internet to a user's PC may take hours with a slow modem.



<BR>



<BR>When the two computers communicating have modems of different speeds, they converse at the speed of the slower modem.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>Nearly any computer equipped with a modem and communications software (which controls the modem) can access and use the Internet. Many of the more exciting and recent developments on the Internet, however, can be exploited only by certain types of 
computers, and relatively powerful ones, at that.



<BR></P>



<P>As you'll see later in this chapter, most Internet resources show only text&#151;words and numbers&#151;on the user's screen; they don't display any pictures. Older, slower computers and modems can handle such basic text activities pretty well. But the 
addition of pictures (and video, and sound) makes far greater demands on both the computer and the modem. The computer files that store pictures and sound are very large, so they can take some time to travel through a modem to a user's computer, and they 
require a lot of processing power once they get there.



<BR></P>



<P>That's why the Internet software tools for exploiting these emerging features require powerful computers and fast modems and may only work on well-equipped, recent models of IBM-compatible PCs, Macintoshes, and UNIX workstations, all with very fast 
modems. The fast modems are required so that users aren't left waiting every time the Internet tries to show them a picture. The powerful computer hardware is required to display graphics and play sound, two activities that demand a lot of horsepower.



<BR></P>



<P>Users typically equip their computers with a graphical user interface (GUI), a computer program that makes using the computer easier and also makes displaying pictures simpler. All Macintoshes come equipped with a GUI, while IBM-compatible PCs and UNIX 
workstations can be equipped with optional GUIs (Microsoft Windows on the PCs, and Motif on the UNIX computers). While a graphical user interface is the preferred solution, computers lacking a GUI can also use pictures on the Internet through programs that 
first copy the pictures to the user's computer, then show them through special display software.



<BR></P>

<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>Once again, those who have access to the Internet from a terminal in a company or college needn't think about an Internet connection&#151;the organization has taken care of that for them.



<BR></P>



<P>Others need to acquire a line into the Internet. It's been pointed out that the Internet is free&#151;and that's basically true. But for technical reasons having to do with the capacities of internetworks, the number of lines into the Internet are 
limited. That problem is alleviated when groups of people share a connection. Instead of all connecting to the Internet individually, they all connect to a large computer, and that computer is connected to the Internet.



<BR></P>

<BR>



<BR>There are three basic types of Internet connections:



<BR>



<BR>Permanent&#151;The computer is connected to the Internet through a communications line leased from a telephone company or other communications carrier. This allows the computer to communicate with the Internet at all times. Large businesses, 
universities, and other heavy Internet users have permanent connections.



<BR>



<BR>Dial-in&#151;The computer uses a modem to communicate through telephone lines with another computer that has a permanent Internet connection. Dial-in connections are used by people who need the Internet occasionally, not all the time. These dial-in 
connections come in two types. Direct dial-in connections, also sometimes called IP links, enable the user to work as if he or she had a &quot;personal&quot; permanent connection, and to use whatever software tools he or she chooses (see &quot;It Takes 
Software Tools for Navigating the Internet&quot; in this chapter). The cheaper option, a dial-in terminal connection (sometimes called a shell or command-line account), usually limits the user to the capabilities of the computer he or she dials into, which 
may or may not provide a full suite of tools to work with. Dial-in terminal connections work well for most text-only Internet resources but may not support other Internet resources. (For more on dial-up accounts, see the section &quot;They Hop Online&quot; 
in Chapter 10.)



<BR>



<BR>Mail&#151;This is a special link to the Internet that allows the user to send and receive e-mail but use no other Internet resource. When online services such as CompuServe allow users to exchange Internet e-mail, they are providing a mail connection. 
Users can also subscribe to dial-in connections that limit them to e-mail but may be less expensive than full-blown dial-in connections.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>The folks that own and operate the computers that supply dial-in services charge a fee for each connection. They have to pay to keep their own computer running, and they have to pay for their permanent line to the Internet. (They don't actually have to 
pay for the Internet, but they have to pay a communications carrier a monthly fee for the use of the wires to connect to the Internet.) Those costs&#151;plus a reasonable profit&#151;justify the fee many Internet users pay to use the free Internet.



<BR></P>



<P>The fees vary by supplier; typically, an individual user pays from 75 cents to a dollar or more per minute, with a monthly minimum of $5 to $50. Some suppliers sweeten the deal by throwing in a package of software tools, or supplying free access to 
some non-free Internet resources, such as ClariNet, a fee-based news and information service. Typically, any software supplied by the access providers  is available as freeware or shareware on the Internet anyway&#151;but the dial-in supplier can save 
users the trouble of finding, copying, and configuring the stuff themselves, which really is a big help.

<BR>



<BR>As mentioned earlier in this chapter, online information services such as America Online and  CompuServe offer access to some Internet resources. Charges vary by provider, and all tack on an extra charge for Internet use.



<BR>



<BR>Connection shoppers will have to examine carefully the cost and completeness of each service's Internet offerings to determine whether an online service represents a better value than a dial-in connection from their local Internet dial-in suppliers.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>Not all individual users have to pay, however. Some universities or other institutions with permanent connections allow a limited number of users who aren't part of the organization to tag along. Around the country there are also &quot;Free-Nets,&quot; 
Internet connections supplied free (or for a very modest fee) as a community service by local governments, libraries, or other institutions. Only a scattering of Free-Nets exist today, including several in Ohio, a few in Illinois and others in the U.S., 
Canada, and abroad; but more will appear soon.



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Really Curious?</B>



<BR>



<BR>You can find a list of Free-Nets and information about locating still more Free-Nets in Navigating the Internet, described in Chapter 10.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>Usually, a Free-Net's capabilities are fairly limited. Most work like dial-in terminal connections and may not support the full range of Internet resources.

<BR>



<BR>Recently, the public library system in Maryland began offering low-cost Internet access through a program subsidized by Maryland and the Federal government. Maryland residents can get a mail connection for about $35 per year or more complete Internet 
access for a higher fee that's still far less than what commercial suppliers charge.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>It Takes Software Tools for Navigating the Internet</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>For users to take full advantage of the resources on the Internet, they need access to various tools and facilities. These tools are computer programs that the user must be able to run, either on the user's own computer, on the access provider's 
computer, or on another computer the user can access through the Internet. For example:



<BR></P>



<UL>



<LI>E-mail requires a software tool for composing, addressing, sending, receiving, and reading mail.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Newsgroups require a program called a newsreader that locates selected newsgroups, searches through them for selected messages, and displays the messages. Newsreaders also provide features for writing and posting messages to newsgroups.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>A special family of Internet resources called the World Wide Web (WWW) requires a tool called a browser to locate resources on the WWW and to take advantage of its special searching and multimedia features.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Copying computer files (which may contain text information, such as reports, or software programs) from the Internet to a user's computer usually requires a tool called an FTP program.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Interactive online discussions require a Talk program.



<BR>



<BR></LI></UL>



<P>People who use computer terminals or dial-in terminal (command line) connections are typically limited to the tools located on the host computer to which they're attached, or to tools available on another computer they can access. For example, to use 
Talk (see Chapter 6), these users must be able to access a Talk program on the host computer they use. Users who have direct dial-in connections can take advantage of Internet software they can run on their own computers; they can run a Talk program of 
their own, in many cases. Depending on the tool involved, the user's own software can provide the tool, or can expand and improve the functions of a tool program that's running on another Internet computer. 



<BR></P>



<P>Internet software tools do more than simply provide access to resources. They can make finding specific resources simpler by providing search features or indexes of resources. They can also feature handy menus or icons that make using some resources 
simpler. By evolving into more capable, easier-to-use versions, these tools are a big part of what's inviting more and more people to give the Internet a try.



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Curious About the Word?</B>



<BR>



<BR>A menu is an on-screen list of choices, from which the user makes a selection. Most Internet software tools provide menus so that users don't have to remember commands to get things done. Many Internet resources themselves also present menus from 
which users choose items in order to use specific features of the resource.



<BR>



<BR>An icon is a little picture on the screen of software tools that are used with a computer mouse. The user moves the mouse pointer to the picture and then clicks the mouse button to start the action represented by the icon. For example, to print 
something, the user might click on an icon that looks like a little printer.



<BR>



<BR>All software for the Macintosh and IBM-type computers equipped with the popular Microsoft Windows program offer both menus and icons in order to be easy to use and to learn.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>There is a growing number of commercially available Internet software tools for users' computers. For now, however, most users prefer the freeware and shareware programs that can be copied directly from the Internet. (Of course, users must have enough 
Internet software at least to get onto the Internet and copy this stuff in the first place. Internet access providers typically supply a set of basic freeware or shareware programs when a user signs up.) Like all programs, these are periodically updated 
and improved. Internet users can copy the updates as soon as they're available.



<BR></P>



<P>The next several pages show examples of some popular Internet software tools for IBM-compatible PCs that have Microsoft Windows. In some cases, these tools are used to expand upon an Internet facility that's actually running on another computer. For 
example, the Archie program shown isn't required to use Archie (see Chapter 7)&#151;anybody can use Archie by using the Internet to access a computer called an Archie server. The software tool shown simply makes using Archie easier, and adds an FTP tool so 
that a user can search for a file and then copy it without having to switch to another tool. Similarly, a user needn't have WinGopher on his or her computer to use Gopher menus, but WinGopher makes using Gopher menus easier.



<BR></P>



<P>In other cases, the software tool on the user's computer supplies a function unavailable any other way. For example, users can browse the World Wide Web without having a special browsing tool like Mosaic on their own computers. But taking full 
advantage of the WWW's special facilities (see Chapter 7) really does require Mosaic or another graphical browser on the user's computer.



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Curious About the Word?</B>



<BR>



<BR>Software  available through the Internet comes in three basic types:



<BR>



<BR>Freeware software is absolutely free of charge and available to all.



<BR>



<BR>Shareware is offered on a try-before-you-buy plan. Users can copy the software and try it out for free, but are instructed to send a nominal fee (usually $10 to $50) to the programmer if they intend to use the software regularly.



<BR>



<BR>Commercial software is like the packaged software sold in stores (but without the box), and is offered by the same commercial software companies. Commercial software requires payment up front; typically, the user must supply a credit card number 
before copying the software files. In other cases, the software is &quot;locked&quot; and won't function until the user enters a code number that the software vendor gives him once payment is received.

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Eudora</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H4>



<P>Eudora is an e-mail program available as shareware and in a more full-featured commercial version. It enables users to check whether there's mail waiting for them, read their mail, automatically reply to a message they've received, forward a message to 
another user, and compose and send new e-mail messages. Eudora features menus and icons to make the program both convenient and easy to learn.



<BR></P>

<H4><A ID="I9" NAME="I9">



<FONT SIZE=3><B>NewsReader!</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H4>



<P>NewsReader! (see Figure 5.1) is a shareware program for locating newsgroups, searching through and reading messages in newsgroups, and composing and posting messages on newsgroups. It can locate newsgroups on a specific topic; for example, the user can 
type cooking, and the program will display the names of newsgroups having the word cooking in their names. The user can then go to one of the cooking newsgroups simply by clicking a mouse button.



<BR></P>



<P>While the user is in a newsgroup, NewsReader! helps the user find messages related to a particular subject or to rearrange the messages to make finding information easier.



<BR></P>



<P>For more on newsgroups, see Chapter 6.

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Mosaic</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H4>



<P>Mosaic (Figure 5.2) is a popular freeware browsing tool for the World Wide Web (WWW). It enables users to easily enjoy the special &quot;hypermedia&quot; searching capabilities of WWW resources and to play the multimedia resources available on the WWW. 
Mosaic is available not only for PCs with Windows, but also for Macintoshes and UNIX workstations. (Mosaic requires a special type of Internet connection; see Chapter 10.) 



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Curious About the Word?</B>



<BR>



<BR>Hypermedia is a new method of presenting information; it enables users to jump quickly from one presentation to a related one by choosing a keyword within the first presentation.



<BR>



<BR>Multimedia is the ability to present many different kinds of information&#151;text, pictures, video, and sound&#151;on a computer. Mosaic allows Internet users to access and play multimedia resources from the WWW.



<BR>



<BR>Hypermedia and multimedia are the great benefits the Internet gains through the WWW. You'll learn more about hypermedia and multimedia in Chapter 7.

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Archie</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H4>



<P>Archie runs on large computers on the Internet, not on the user's computer. There are programs that make using those Archie programs on the Internet easier. For example, there's an FTP tool, so that when a user finds a file with Archie, he or she can 
quickly and conveniently copy the file to his or her computer. Without a tool like that, users have to find and copy files in two steps: 1) Use Archie to find the file, and 2) Use FTP to copy it.

<P>WinGopher (see Figure 5.3) makes it easier to use Gophers&#151;menus that make finding and using some resources on the Internet easier. The WinGopher software helps users search or browse through these menus, picking items as they go, to locate a 
particular resource, and to then access that resource.

<P>QVT WinNet (see Figure 5.4) is an example of a multipurpose Internet access tool. It supports basic access to other computer systems on the Internet through Telnet (see Chap-ter 7). It supports copying files from other computers, and it gives you the 
ability to read your e-mail and look at what's on newsgroups (but not to send e-mail or newsgroup messages). Each tool is started separately by clicking the mouse pointer on a rectangular button. So even though WinNet combines tools, the tools remain 
essentially separate.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>It Takes Basic Computer and Communications Skills</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>Although Internet tools are improving to make using the Internet easier, there's no getting around the fact that users need basic competence with their own computers to use the Internet effectively. Productive Interneting means copying files, starting 
and exiting programs, using menus and icons, printing, typing and editing text, and more. Users may need to know how to perform decompression (also called unzipping and unpacking) of files that are sent over the Internet in a compressed state for quicker 
transmission.



<BR></P>



<P>Users also need to know how to &quot;log on&quot; or &quot;sign on&quot; to the Internet&#151;a procedure that varies by computer and Internet connection, but that usually requires typing a unique username and secret password.



<BR></P>



<P>Internet users needn't be computer scientists, but computer novices who want to enter the world of the Internet need to become competent with their computers first, before branching out onto the Internet.



<BR></P>



<H3><A ID="I15" NAME="I15">



<FONT SIZE=4><B>It Takes Knowing Where to Look</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>Despite the assistance available through tools, the Internet remains a varied, largely disorganized place in which finding specific resources can be tricky and time-consuming. To be productive, users must develop their Internet research skills.



<BR></P>



<P>They must become familiar with the many special indexes and search tools such as Archie, Gopher, and WebCrawler, a tool for searching the World Wide Web (see Chapter 7). These tools can streamline the search for resources by allowing the user to type a 
subject name or other &quot;search term&quot; and extract a list of resources to try. They must keep careful notes about how to locate resources they use often, so they can quickly return to those resources later without repeating the search. (To make 
revisiting a snap, some software tools keep records of resources the user has visited and how he or she got there.)



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>After what you have read to this point, the Internet may sound as much fun as a tax audit. There's just so much out there, it can be a little overwhelming.



<BR></P>



<P>After breaking in, however, most Internet users quickly settle down to a few tools and resources they use regularly. Then they don't have to worry about the ten trillion things on the Internet. They have to keep track of only the four or five things 
they do, which isn't very tough.

<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>Using the Internet demands appropriate computer equipment, an Internet connection, software tools (or access to tools through another computer), and basic skills. It may also require money.



<BR></P>



<P>Most of all, it requires that you have a need for what the Internet offers. If the need is there, none of the other requirements is too difficult to manage. If the need is not there, most of the other requirements represent a waste of time, money, and 
effort. You're better off walking to the library.
