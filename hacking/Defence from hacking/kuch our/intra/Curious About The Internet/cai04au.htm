<P>Can some of these fears be written off as mere technophobia or as the natural apprehension that accompanies the arrival of anything that's big, pervasive, and difficult to understand (like MTV)? Perhaps. Still, like any new technology from firemaking 
to genetic engineering, the Internet has plenty potential to be misused, abused, or applied to unsavory purposes. Only by extrapolating the worst-case scenarios can people ensure that the Internet will evolve in a way that minimizes the risks.

<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Curious About the Word?</B>



<BR>



<BR>Hacker refers generally to computer experts with the skills necessary to break into other computers. Although high-profile cases of hackers who used their skills to steal and spy have made the name a derogatory one, not all hackers are malicious. 
Lately, another term, cracker, is often used to describe computer break-in experts, malicious and otherwise. Still another word, cyberpunk, has been used to describe members of a growing culture of hackers who aren't out to steal, but rather to create 
minor (occasionally major) mischief and practice rebellious civil disobedience by breaking into computers through networks. To keep things simple in this chapter, I'll stick with the broadest term, hacker.



<BR>



<BR>Keep in mind, though, that when I say hackers sometimes perpetrate a particular offense, the suggestion is not that all&#151;or even most&#151;hackers ever would do such a thing. Rather, the suggestion is that a person would have to have a hacker's 
skills to pull off the offense.

<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>This particular argument is as old as the telephone. People who inhabit an electronic neighborhood of Internet companions can experience human interaction without ever leaving their desks. This, sociologists have said, may ultimately isolate them, 
making them uncomfortable with face-to-face interaction. The Internet isn't the only culprit in that development&#151;the phone, home video, telecommuting, and other homey trends are &quot;cocooning&quot; us in ways that divide us and make us unable to 
communicate with one another, the theory goes.



<BR></P>



<P>Despite the fact that it can interconnect people with infinitely varied backgrounds and interests, the Internet can also foster a certain narrow field of contact because people can restrict their communications to only those who share their interests. 
Those who limit their activities to hanging around narrowly focused newsgroups and other Internet resources need never interact with people whose interests are different.



<BR></P>



<P>Even the development of &quot;virtual communities&quot;&#151;which aim to create balanced groups of like-minded people who communicate on a network&#151;ultimately isolates those people from the rest of the Internet and its assortment of personalities 
and points of view. The resulting electronic provincialism may not be good for fostering tolerance and understanding among people of differing backgrounds.

<BR>



<BR>&quot;Somewhere we have gotten hold of the idea that the more all-embracing we can make our communications networks, the closer we will be to that connection that we long for deep down. For change us as they will, our technologies have not yet 
eradicated that flame of a desire&#151;not merely to be in touch, but to be, at least figuratively, embraced, known and valued not abstractly but in presence. We seem to believe that our instruments can get there, but they can't.&quot;



<BR>



<BR>From Sven Birkerts, The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of Reading in an Electronic Age (Faber &amp; Faber, 1994), quoted in Harper's Magazine, May 1994 (p. 17).

<FONT SIZE=4><B>It Distributes Unreliable, Unchecked Information</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>As a news medium, the Internet is faster than newspapers or most television, and it benefits from the news noses of about 30 million potential reporters. On the other hand, few of the reporters are trained journalists, and the accuracy of their work 
does not bear the scrutiny and checks that good journalism demands.



<BR></P>



<P>Like any largely unedited intercourse, the Internet can be a terrific medium for unsubstantiated rumors, gossip, libel, misunderstandings, misinformation, disinformation, and flat-out lies. Internet users have the ability to broadcast (and embellish) 
errors to millions in minutes. Fortunately, Internet users who discover errors are often just as quick to set the record straight.



<BR></P>



<P>At this writing, some legal questions regarding libel on the Internet are still being worked out. Precedent was set, in a case several years ago involving a libelous message sent through the CompuServe network, that networks cannot be held liable for 
the information they carry. That's good&#151;it keeps networks from feeling an obligation to restrict freedom of speech over their wires.



<BR></P>



<P>It also means that individuals bear the liability for their words on the Internet. Today, if somebody sends a damaging statement about you on the Internet, you can sue. In Australia recently, an anthropologist successfully sued another anthropologist 
who posted a libelous message. In an American case that's still pending as of this writing, the publisher of an electronic newsletter on the Internet is being sued because his newsletter accused a direct-mail company on the Internet of fraud. Whether he 
wins or loses, he'll face a big legal bill.



<BR></P>



<P>Ultimately, the only guardians of truth on the Internet are the little-used libel laws (and something can be false and still not be libel), the sharp eyes of honest Internet users, and the moderators who gently oversee the traffic on some bulletin 
boards. In a conversational community of millions, that leaves a lot of room for bad information to go a long way.



<BR></P>



<H3><A ID="I6" NAME="I6">



<FONT SIZE=4><B>It Spreads Hate</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>The Internet is a free-speech environment. That sounds great, until one notices that it also allows those who would spread bigotry and hate to expound upon their world view and to exchange ideas for making the world a worse place, all with relative 
anonymity.



<BR></P>



<P>There are Internet bulletin boards populated by neo-nazis, racists, gay-bashers, anti-Semites, and others of the kind. In the summer of 1994, U.S. News &amp; World Report revealed that the Simon Wiesenthal Center had just completed a three-year study 
of computer hatemongering and had submitted an enormous dossier to the Federal Communications Commission, along with the suggestion that the FCC should look into whether it has the power to get the haters off the network.



<BR></P>



<P>But the FCC has no such power, and constitutionalists say there's not really any solution permitted by the First Amendment. So, just as in other communities, the Internet is going to have to continue policing itself. Some users actually visit the 
hatemongering bulletin boards to rebut&#151;with documentation ready&#151;factual errors used in support of hate (such as the persistent suggestion that the Holocaust never happened).



<BR></P>



<P>Other users do the only thing they can: They ignore it.



<BR></P>

<BR>



<BR>A problem related to hate on the Internet is that the Internet is an inherently sexist culture. Nobody knows the precise demographics of the Internet, but it's clear that male users far outnumber females. Critics of Internet culture have observed that 
the male-dominated exchanges on the Internet often have the effect of drowning out or &quot;shouting down&quot; the voices and opinions of women users.



<BR>



<BR>An article in The Nation (&quot;Free Speech on the Internet,&quot; June 13, 1994) quotes Ellen Broidy, history bibliographer at University of California-Irvine's library. Broidy says that even in feminist-oriented resources, &quot;two or three men 
will get on and dominate the conversation, either by being provocative, or by flooding the system with comments on everything. It's like talk radio, only worse.&quot; Cindy Tittle Moore, a moderator of a feminist Internet resource, told The Nation, 
&quot;It should be mandatory for every male on the [Internet] to seriously pretend being female for two weeks to see the difference.&quot;



<BR>



<BR>The fast growth in the number of Internet users is probably helping to balance the gender mix. As in other previously male-dominated environments, however, women on the Internet will probably have to endure belittling and bullying from some men even 
after the men no longer outnumber them.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>It Creates Job Insecurity</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>As described in Chapter 3, the virtual corporation (VC) is a new, emerging business model in which the large company staffed with permanent workers is replaced by a small team of executives who manage an ever-changing field of freelancers who are hired 
and let go as needed. The Internet is an important part of enabling the VC because it provides a way for VCs to locate, hire, and communicate with freelancers wherever they may be.



<BR></P>



<P>Although many people are attracted by the growth in self-employment that VCs promise, VCs do away with the idea of secure, long-term jobs for most people, condemning them to a life of constant job-hunting.



<BR></P>



<P>As writer Bob Kuttner pointed out in a syndicated column about VC:



<BR></P>



<P>Every vocational virtue cannot be reduced to entrepreneurship. Creativity, diligence, self-improvement and teamwork often require a more stable work environment.... Yes, more people are self-employed today. But for every well-paid independent 
contractor who is a computer technician or financial consultant, there are dozens working at crummy 'temp' jobs who would rather have actual careers.



<BR></P>



<P>(Column, &quot;The Pitfalls of a Virtual Corporation,&quot; The Boston Globe, July 30, 1993)



<BR></P>



<P>By providing the workspace into which the VC may move, the Internet may well take part in shifting many of us into new work roles we'd rather not have.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>It Threatens National Security</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>In his book The Cuckoo's Egg, author Cliff Stoll tells the true story of how, while manager of a computer system at Lawrence Berkeley Lab, he used computers to discover, locate, and catch a spy in Germany who was breaking into U.S. military computers 
and trying to steal secrets. True, Stoll used the Internet to catch the guy. On the other hand, it was the Internet that enabled the guy to break into the computers in the first place.



<BR></P>



<P>Other high-profile cases of computer espionage and mischievous corruption of sensitive information cast doubt upon the wisdom of having the world's computers&#151;especially those storing government and military information&#151;hooked into one big, 
uncontrolled network.



<BR></P>



<P>Given modern computer security systems, governments can keep some information on a computer inaccessible to Internet users while making other information available. Computers carrying highly classified information can simply be kept off the Internet, 
period&#151;no wires in, no wires out, no problem. Other security measures include building a &quot;firewall.&quot; A company or other organization that has its own computer network can make one computer on the network directly accessible to the Internet. 
That computer acts as a firewall, inhibiting access to the other computers on the network by enforcing strict security policies requiring passwords or other special procedures.



<BR></P>



<P>The fact is, however, that most computers today are connected to other computers, and most are equipped to allow users to dial in through the telephone lines from other computers. Even if a computer isn't on the Internet, it may be connected to a 
computer that is. A skilled hacker can break into a computer by going through several others on the way. This has the added attraction of helping to cover the hacker's tracks.



<BR></P>



<P>The principal means used today to make computers secure isn't keeping them off networks, but rather requiring users to know secret passwords to use them. And as hackers have proved time and again, passwords are usually easy to break.



<BR></P>



<H3><A ID="I9" NAME="I9">



<FONT SIZE=4><B>It Enables Piracy and Sabotage</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>You've probably read about hackers who break into computers either to steal information or simply to scramble the works. You've probably also heard about computer viruses, nasty little programs that sneak their way into computers and destroy data at a 
predetermined time or in response to some selected event.



<BR></P>



<P>Obviously, by making it easier for people to connect to other computers, the Internet creates opportunity for computer crooks and also provides a nice growth culture for computer viruses. A lot of work has gone into improving computer security systems 
and filtering out viruses when information moves between computers. But none of it is foolproof, and the mischief continues.



<BR></P>



<P>There are also new variants of computer mischief. In July of 1994, Time magazine reported that someone had cracked into a restricted computer at Lawrence Berkeley Lab and stored thousands of dollars' worth of stolen software, and then made it available 
to others through the Internet. Ironically, Lawrence Berkeley is the same facility where Cliff Stoll, years earlier, had raised awareness of the importance of computer security by tracking down that German spy.



<BR></P>



<H3><A ID="I10" NAME="I10">



<FONT SIZE=4><B>It Invades Privacy</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>OK, it's supposed to work like this: Messages people post on the Internet are assumed to be public and can be read and copied by anyone. So Internet users don't put anything too private in those messages. E-mail, on the other hand, is carefully 
addressed to a specific person and is intended to be read only by that person&#151;as private and confidential as a letter dropped in a mailbox. So e-mail can be used to exchange state secrets, confessions, love letters, and financial statements.



<BR></P>



<P>Or can it? First of all, like any other mail, e-mail is the property of its recipient, not the sender. A person can do whatever he or she likes with e-mail received, including forwarding it to others (who then may do whatever they want with it) and 
even posting it somewhere for anybody to see. Even with e-mail, Internet users must be careful about who they send to and what they say.



<BR></P>



<P>Herein lies the question of whether e-mail really is private. Ask yourself: If hackers can use the Internet to break into government computers and steal secrets, how hard can it be for somebody to read somebody else's e-mail? The answer: Not very. 
Hackers can break into computers and read the e-mail received by those computers, or they may do something called data harvesting, in which e-mail or other information is intercepted and copied on its way across the network, between computers.



<BR></P>



<P>Hackers aren't the only snoopers. System administrators, also known as system operators or &quot;sysops&quot; for short, are the people employed to keep a particular computer system or network running. To do that effectively, they need the power to 
override any security restrictions built into the system. In effect, system administrators on most computer systems (including those that use the Internet) can look at any file&#151;including e-mail files&#151;stored on computers they control.

<P>Like others in positions of authority, system administrators are supposed to exercise their power responsibly, but there's little to stop an unscrupulous system administrator from peeking at others' e-mail. People who use PCs and a commercial Internet 
access provider to dial-in to the Internet (see Chapter 5) often aren't aware that their access provider's computer is run by a system administrator who has the power to read their e-mail.

<BR>There are Internet privacy worries other than e-mail. There's information about you and me stored on computers all over the place&#151;the government, the department stores, the direct marketers, the credit-card companies, and so on. Many of these 
computers can be accessed through the Internet.



<BR>



<BR>Now, rest assured, all the organizations that have information about us have taken normal precautions to safeguard it from snoops. But if people really wanted to get to it, they might succeed. Having those computers on the Internet only multiplies the 
potential exposure of your privacy and mine.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>While hackers have the power to invade e-mail, they're not the big problem. Under current law, reading somebody else's e-mail is a crime (a federal crime, no less) if the e-mail is sent across a public e-mail system. But if it's sent over a private 
e-mail system, such as the internal e-mail systems used in many businesses, then it isn't protected. That allows companies (or the government, for that matter) to surreptitiously read employee's e-mail&#151;including e-mail they've received. Estimates say 
20 to 30 percent of companies do just that.



<BR></P>



<P>The problem is that being a network of networks, the Internet is kind of a hybrid of a public and private e-mail system. Because the laws protecting e-mail are relatively new, nobody's decided yet whether the Internet really is public or private. That 
leaves open the strong possibility that anybody's e-mail is subject to legal intrusion. There have been a number of big instances of e-mail snooping. The mayor of Colorado Springs, Colorado, secretly read the City Council's e-mail. The U.S. Secret Service 
monitored e-mail and other computer communications in an effort to snare unscrupulous hackers.



<BR></P>



<P>The good news is that e-mail is safe from casual snooping; a person has to know what he or she is doing, and do it on purpose, to read someone else's e-mail. And there's so much e-mail traffic&#151;most of it boring&#151;that there's little danger of 
someone randomly invading e-mail in the hopes of finding something interesting.



<BR></P>



<P>The bad news is that because people have become so dependent on e-mail lately, anything less than complete privacy has big implications for the future of freedom of speech and privacy rights. Because the Internet is fast becoming the major e-mail 
network to the world, it is the battleground over which these issues will be decided.

<BR>



<BR>There are high-level initiatives underway to improve computer (and Internet) security, the most important of which is the Clipper project, a system designed by the U.S. government for translating e-mail messages and phone calls into code so they can't 
be snooped on a network.



<BR>



<BR>Unfortunately, Clipper is the subject of controversy. The government wants the system to be secure from everyone but the government, who says it wants to be able to eavesdrop on messages that will help convict drug traffickers and terrorists. The 
government hasn't asked for unrestricted power to eavesdrop. The &quot;key&quot; to the code is to be held in escrow by two government agencies, who will surrender it to law enforcement officials only upon court order.



<BR>



<BR>Many in the Internet community, however, want the system to be safe from everyone&#151;including the government&#151;who they charge with wanting a way into the system just so that the Internal Revenue Service can keep an eye on all the money that 
will change hands on the Internet as it becomes more commercial.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>It Enables Fraud</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>As business use of the Internet expands, the logical next step is to allow Internet users to order products through the Internet and to pay for them by giving their credit-card numbers. Users are already paying for goods and services this way, and the 
credit-card traffic is expected to increase as more commercial resources debut on the Internet.



<BR></P>



<P>Credit-card commerce has always experienced a high fraud rate, especially since people began giving their credit-card numbers over the phone to telemarketers. But given the dangers of computer break-ins and data harvesting (see the earlier section, 
&quot;It Invades Privacy&quot;), allowing people to expose their credit cards to the Internet seems like an invitation to fraud. Just as hackers and unscrupulous system administrators have the power to read others' e-mail, they could easily steal 
credit-card numbers, use them to make purchases, and then cover up their tracks before the credit-card owner knows what's happening.



<BR></P>



<P>Beyond such flat-out theft lies the possibility of more prankish fraud, such as using someone else's name, address, and credit-card number to make bogus orders&#151;like ordering 1,000 copies of Das Kapital to be sent to, and billed to, the Republican 
Party. Unlike straight credit-card theft, this time the merchandise is shipped to the credit-card owner, so he or she can return it and get the money back. But this person can't recover his or her time and trouble, and the seller may have to eat the 
shipping costs. Pranks can be a serious and costly problem, too.



<BR></P>



<P>The Internet leaves open doors to other types of fraud, as well. Commercialization of the Internet will lead to an increase in fee-based resources. Crooks could work around the billing system so that when they use the resource, the bill goes to someone 
else. On other fee-based systems in the past, crooks have done this so subtly that many times the user stuck with the inflated bill never detected the fraud.



<BR></P>

<BR>



<BR>CommerceNet, a consortium of California companies formed to facilitate commercial use of the Internet, is developing a new version of the popular Internet access software Mosaic (see Chapter 7) that might help. The software would employ a new type of 
encryption (a system for putting information in code so it can't be read by anyone but its intended reader) that would supposedly prevent fraud by putting business communications such as credit-card charges in code, and by making absolutely certain that 
the purchase comes from the person whose name is on the order through the use of an &quot;electronic signature.&quot;



<BR>



<BR>CommerceNet hopes this will make the Internet safe enough not just for shopping, but also for electronic banking. One day, Internet users will be able to transfer money straight from their checking accounts to the merchants. (See Chapter 9).



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>The possibility of fraud is often cited by those who believe the commercialization of the Internet will proceed very slowly. Many companies will shy away from the Internet for doing any real sales until it becomes much more secure. And many users will 
shy away from using commercial resources until they have confidence that their credit-card numbers won't end up buying lingerie in Paris for some hacker's girlfriend.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>It Carries Unrestricted Pornography</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>In Chapter 3, you learned that the curious can get sexually explicit writing and pictures through the Internet. Whether that's a problem or not is up to you. Like nearly all pornography, nobody forces it on anybody. You have to go looking for it to get 
it. But some people are offended by the very idea that it exists, and others have considerable concern that their curious, computer-literate children may find the stuff.



<BR></P>



<P>The Internet is unlikely to be censored any time soon, so the only solution for grownups who worry about the pornography is: Don't go looking for it and you won't find it. For those concerned about their kids, the options are:



<BR></P>



<P>a) Keep your kids off the Internet.



<BR></P>



<P>b) Supervise your kids.



<BR></P>



<P>c) Teach your kids well, then trust them.



<BR></P>



<P>The U.S. government, however, likes to appear to support wholesomeness&#151;a quality that is definitely not inclusive of dirty pictures and erotic writing. So when the Los Angeles Times discovered a cache of hard-core porn on a computer at Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory&#151;a U.S. weapons lab connected to the Internet&#151;some officials began musing about trying to regulate the Internet.



<BR></P>



<P>But the Internet got a bad rap&#151;it was later determined that the porn had been put there from within the lab (presumably by a lab employee), not across the Internet. So there.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>It Empowers the Few and Excludes the Many</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>Here may be the most far-reaching sociological Internet debate. Chapter 3 pointed out that the Internet brings together people from many different countries, cultures, and backgrounds, and that such cross-cultural interplay may be good for global 
understanding and harmony.



<BR></P>



<P>Then again, the Internet may also divide people. Consider the basic similarities among Internet users. They all



<BR></P>



<UL>



<LI>Can read and write.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Have access to a computer.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Have the education to use that computer and the Internet successfully.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Have the money to pay for an Internet connection, or have the support of an organization that has the money.



<BR>



<BR></LI></UL>



<P>To many in the American middle class, these criteria look pretty basic and not too far out of reach. But the fact is that the majority of American citizens&#151;and the great majority of world citizens&#151;cannot meet all four criteria. They are 
therefore shut out of this global meeting place, this window on the world that we call the Internet.



<BR></P>



<P>The privileged group that meets all four criteria can get more information far more quickly than everybody else. That gives them a tremendous advantage in today's world. They can locate a job before it even appears in a newspaper. They can stay abreast 
of world events that others may not even hear about. These &quot;haves&quot; will tend to be better-educated and wealthier than the &quot;have-nots&quot; in the first place, and their access to the information on the Internet may tend to widen both the 
educational and economic distinctions.



<BR></P>



<P>As described in Chapter 3, Internet users break &quot;gag orders&quot; and report about events on which the mainstream news media is obligated to keep silent. In those cases, Internet users become privy to information that nobody else is allowed to 
see. Critics argue that this distinction in information access is inherently undemocratic, and makes non-Internet users into second-class citizens.

<BR>The solution is to get the Internet to everybody&#151;and that's one of the goals of the National Information Infrastructure initiative spearheaded by U.S. Vice President Al Gore. Of course, merely providing universal access to the Internet doesn't 
fully address the problem. Experts say that as many as 20 percent of U.S. adults are functionally illiterate. If the schism described here is to be avoided, inequities in education and in other areas must be addressed, as well.



<BR>



<BR>For more on the National Information Infrastructure project,  see Chapter 9.

<P>There are many reasons why people worry about what the Internet may bring about, and where it is headed.



<BR></P>



<P>The most important, immediate worries center around the security and reliability of information and computers on the Internet. Is the valuable information in government and business safe when their computers are on the Internet? Some think not.



<BR></P>



<P>There are also concerns about how the Internet is affecting our culture. Some fear it separates us more than it connects us. Others say it will foster changes to the way business is done that will turn us into a world of freelancers, and make job 
security a thing of the past.



<BR></P>



<P>As I hope you've seen, most of the worries can be resolved, or at least minimized. And the benefits of the Internet, described in Chapter 3 and throughout this book, make it worth a try.



<BR></P>
