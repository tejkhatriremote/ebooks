<BR></FONT></A></H2>



<P>Read this chapter to satisfy your curiosity about exactly how people reach out and touch one another on the Internet. The answers include the following:



<BR></P>



<UL>



<LI>They exchange e-mail.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>They have one-to-one conversations.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>They chat in groups.

<LI>They subscribe to mailing lists.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>They post and read messages in newsgroups.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>They find each other through directory services.



<BR>



<BR></LI></UL>



<P>For some, these activities represent all they ever use the Internet for. They don't seek piles of research data; they seek specific answers to specific questions, face-to-face (well, almost). E-mail and its relatives described in this chapter are the 
links through which the citizens of the online world relate.



<BR></P>



<P>As you'll see, though, basic e-mail can serve as a formidable research tool. Beyond the fact that it gives you a way to query experts around the word, e-mail can supply a steady stream of news and letters&#151;automatically&#151;about almost any topic.




<BR></P>



<H3><A ID="I4" NAME="I4">



<FONT SIZE=4><B>They Exchange E-mail</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>Why do people use e-mail? Well_



<BR></P>



<UL>



<LI>It's cheap. It costs nothing beyond what the user is paying for Internet access, if anything. Users save not only postage, but also paper and envelope costs. It's typically cheaper than faxing, too&#151;saving the cost of fax paper and long-distance 
telephone charges. Long messages cost the same as short ones, and sending a letter to Switzerland costs the same as sending one across town.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>It's fast. Most e-mail messages are delivered within a few minutes or even seconds. Some messages can take a few hours, and in very unusual cases, days. E-mail nevertheless remains the overwhelming odds-on favorite in a race against carried paper 
mail.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>It's convenient. People who have access to computers do most of their writing on the computer anyway. With e-mail, they write on the computer and then send the message on its way with a few keystrokes&#151;no paper, no postage, no problems. If they 
lack e-mail, they must print the letter, address and seal the envelope, affix postage, walk to the nearest mailbox, and say a short prayer to ensure delivery.



<BR>



<BR></LI></UL>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Really Curious?</B>



<BR>



<BR>For most practical purposes, e-mail is completely private and confidential. Unfortunately, it is not absolutely private and confidential. Illegal snoopers can secretly read other people's e-mail, and worse, some people are allowed to spy on e-mail 
legally. See Chapter 4 for more about privacy on the Internet.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>The speed, economy, and convenience of e-mail is achieved by simply copying a computer file containing a message from one computer to another through the network. Boiled down, it works like this (refer to Figure 6.1):



<BR></P>



<OL>



<LI>The sender uses his or her e-mail software as a simple word processing program to write, edit, and proofread the message. The e-mail program creates a computer file containing the message. (Some people use their favorite word processing program to 
compose the message and then use the e-mail software to send the file created by the word processor.)



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>The sender types the Internet address of the recipient in the e-mail program and instructs the program to send the message. (The sender can type multiple addresses to automatically send the same message to several&#151;or many&#151;people at once.) 
The program adds a &quot;header&quot; to the message, a blurb at the top telling the Internet addresses of both the sender and the recipient, the date and time the message was sent, and a subject, if the sender typed one.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Using the recipient's e-mail address as a guide, the e-mail software copies the file containing the message across the network to the recipient's computer, where the message is stored (see Figure 6.1). Actually, the journey from one computer to 
another is the most complicated part of the process, possibly involving the participation of several other computers and numerous network components. Users don't have to concern themselves with this part, however; the Internet does it all, and amazingly, 
it almost always works.



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>The next time the recipient instructs his or her e-mail program to &quot;check the mail,&quot; the program shows a list of unread messages stored on his or her computer. The list usually includes the Internet address of the sender and the subject of 
the message, so the recipient knows who the message is from and what it's about before deciding whether or not to read it right away. The recipient can then instruct the e-mail software to show him or her any of the messages listed.



<BR>



<BR></LI></OL>



<P>



<BR><B><A HREF="06cai01.gif">Figure 6.1.</A> How e-mail works: sender types </B><B>message and recipient's e-mail address; Internet carries message to </B><B>recipient's computer; recipient reads message on his or her computer </B><B>screen.</B>



<BR></P>



<P>Among the more handy features of e-mail are &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;reply.&quot; The recipient can choose the forward feature in the e-mail program, type a new address, and automatically forward the message to another Internet user. If the 
recipient chooses the reply feature, he or she can type a reply message immediately, without needing to type the Internet address of the sender&#151;the e-mail software automatically delivers the reply to the sender of the original message.



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Really Curious?</B>



<BR>



<BR>To see what an e-mail program looks like to some Internet users, see Chapter 5.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>The most intimidating aspect of e-mail may be the Internet addresses themselves. They look complicated, but they aren't really. Whether or not you plan to use the Internet, you'll see Internet addresses on people's business cards, in advertising, and 
even in paper mail and faxes you may receive. So it helps to understand what the addresses are about.



<BR></P>



<P>Like any address, an Internet address includes an individual's (or organization's) name and location information. Unlike postal addresses, the &quot;name&quot; is a made-up name for Internet use, and the location information is a series of 
abbreviations that identify a specific computer, on a specific network, on the Internet. For example, look at my Internet address in Figure 6.2.



<BR></P>



<P>



<BR><B><A HREF="06cai02.gif">Figure 6.2.</A> An Internet e-mail address, </B><B>decoded as: Internet name &quot;at&quot; computer name network.</B>



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Did You Know.</B><B> </B><B>.</B><B> </B><B>.</B>



<BR>



<BR>The type of Internet address shown in Figure 6.2, made up of words, is used for the convenience of people, believe it or not. Internet addresses are actually formed from numbers. When someone types an address in words, the Internet looks up those 
words in a table that tells it the actual number address. This happens behind the scenes, however, so Internet users needn't think about it&#151;the word addresses do the job.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>The first part of the address shown in Figure 6.2 is my name on the Internet, nsnell. I could have made up any name I wanted&#151;I'm especially fond of sparky and athol. But nsnell is easier for me to remember, and it can make finding me easier for 
others who want to send me e-mail. I don't have to be the only nsnell on the Internet; I do have to be the only nsnell at the place described by the rest of my address. The whole address, taken together, must be the only one of its kind so that any e-mail 
sent to that address from anywhere on the Internet can go only to one place.



<BR></P>



<P>The @ symbol means &quot;at,&quot; and the rest of the address describes the computer or network I use. The first word is a name for the computer itself, and the remaining words indicate a &quot;domain,&quot; which is the Internet's fancy way of 
describing the location or network of the computer. Figure 6.2 tells you I use a computer called iquest in the .net domain. (Using .net for the domain also indicates that the computer is part of an Internet-connected network.)



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Really Curious?</B>



<BR>



<BR>To send e-mail, all an Internet user has to know is the recipient's Internet address. But suppose the sender doesn't know the address? There are ways to look up addresses on the Internet. See &quot;They Find Each Other Through Directory Services&quot; 
later in this chapter.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>I, like a growing number of people, use a dial-in Internet connection (see Chapter 5). My PC isn't actually connected to the Internet&#151;my PC uses a modem to connect to another computer downtown, and that computer is connected to the Internet. So in 
my address, the computer and domain name describe the computer network downtown, run by my commercial Internet access provider. The e-mail I receive is also stored on that computer until I read it, at which time I can copy it to my PC.



<BR></P>



<P>Because the Internet includes so many different types of networks, there are some variations on the basic address format. Also, some addresses can be shorter or longer&#151;three, four, five, or more words separated by periods may be necessary to 
describe the computers in complex environments with many users. The typical order, however, remains: name@computer.location.



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Did You Know.</B><B> </B><B>.</B><B> </B><B>.</B>



<BR>



<BR>Some parts of an Internet address you can decipher on sight. At or near the end of an address, you may see any of several standard three-letter abbreviations that indicate the following:



<BR>



<BR>.edu&#151;A university or other edu.cational institution



<BR>



<BR>.com&#151;A com.mercial Internet user



<BR>



<BR>.gov&#151;A gov.ernment user



<BR>



<BR>.mil&#151;A mil.itary user



<BR>



<BR>.org&#151;An org.anization, often a non-profit type



<BR>



<BR>.net&#151;A net.work



<BR>



<BR>Also, some addresses describe not just the computer, but also the geographical location of the computer. For example, the letters



<BR>



<BR>.sf.ca.us



<BR>



<BR>at the end of an address tell you that the user is in San Francisco, California, in the United States.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>Here's one last important point about e-mail. Through the years, e-mail users have developed their own set of customs (OK, rules) about composing and sending messages. Most of these have been designed to keep e-mail communication efficient and to 
prevent wasting network resources, computer storage space, and the reader's time. (They're also designed, like many Internet customs, to separate the veterans from the novices, condescendingly dubbed &quot;newbies.&quot; The Internet is open to all, but 
like any community, it has a few who'd just as soon close the borders.)



<BR></P>



<P>E-mail etiquette&#151;part of what some call &quot;netiquette,&quot; the complete code of Internet conduct&#151;demands that messages be brief and to-the-point, without being cryptic and choppy, of course. Senders are encouraged to type accurate, 
meaningful subject lines in the e-mail programs so that readers know what the message is about before they choose to read it. Using CAPITAL LETTERS to add emphasis is gauche and uncivilized, but using smileys (also called emoticons; refer to Chapter 3) to 
add emotional notes is acceptable, if done with restraint.



<BR></P>



<P>Although everyone appreciates courteous communication, Internet users don't like to waste messages on pleasantries. For example, when someone answers someone else's questions by e-mail, he or she doesn't expect&#151;and usually doesn't want&#151;a 
thank-you e-mail back, which simply clutters the computer with messages that have nothing new to say. E-mail users try to save their thank you's for the next message in which they have something more substantial to say.



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Really Curious?</B>



<BR>



<BR>Internet users can send e-mail to folks who aren't on the Internet.



<BR>



<BR>They can send to folks who use online information services such as CompuServe, Prodigy, or America Online. They do so simply by building an e-mail address out of the name (or other identification) the recipient uses on the online service and a 
computer/domain name for the service itself. For example, my identification number on CompuServe is 72727,3260. If I weren't on the Internet, Internet folks could still send me e-mail by using the address 72727.3260@compuserve.com. Online service users can 
also send e-mail to the Internet, using a similar adaptation of the addressing scheme, which differs service to service.



<BR>



<BR>Internet users can also send an e-mail message through the Internet and have it print out on any fax machine in the world&#151;including those of non-Internet users. Several Internet services make this possible; there's a free service that can't fax 
absolutely everywhere, and other services that can fax anywhere but charge a modest fee.



<BR>



<BR>For specific instructions on sending e-mail to online information systems and faxing, see Navigating the Internet and Your Internet Consultant, both described in Chapter 10.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<H3><A ID="I5" NAME="I5">



<FONT SIZE=4><B>They Have One-to-One Conversations</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>E-mail is the principal Internet communications tool. Sometimes, however, people want the immediacy of an interactive discussion in which messages are traded back and forth instantly, as in a conversation.



<BR></P>



<P>On the Internet, the principle one-to-one conversation tool is called Talk. Talk sets up a two-way conversation between two Internet users, who, for sake of example, I'll call Sparky and Athol. To begin, Sparky fires up an Internet software tool (see 
Chapter 5) that supports Talk and then types Athol's Internet address. The Talk program sends a message to Athol's screen (if he is currently working on the Internet), telling him that Sparky wants to talk with him and telling him how to respond if he, 
indeed, wants to talk with Sparky. The required response is typically nothing more than the word talk, followed by Sparky's Internet address, which already appears on-screen in the message.



<BR></P>



<P>When Athol responds, both Athol's screen and Sparky's are split in some way. On graphical, &quot;windowing&quot; computers like PCs running Microsoft Windows or the Macintosh, the screen splits into two separate windows. On more basic computers, a 
simple line appears across the middle of the screen horizontally, splitting it into top and bottom halves.



<BR></P>



<P>In either case, once the screen is split, everything Sparky types appears in one half, and everything Athol types appears in the other. This happens instantly; Athol can actually see each letter appear on his screen as Sparky presses each key on his 
keyboard. Even when one talker presses the Backspace key to erase a mistake, the other can see it happen. Athol and Sparky can now babble away at each other until one of them breaks the connection.



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Did You Know.</B><B> </B><B>.</B><B> </B><B>.</B>

<BR>Talk works across continents and oceans, and is widely used. Unfortunately, Talk requires special software at both ends of the conversation. Many computers on the Internet have the required software, but not all do. So some Internet users can't Talk; 
rather, they must exchange messages the old- fashioned way&#151;by e-mail.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>They Chat in Groups</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>Internet Relay Chat (IRC), the other method for Internet conversation, is less common than Talk because someone must set up the Chat before others can join in. Chat sessions allow many users to join in the same free-form conversation, usually centered 
(loosely) around a discussion topic.



<BR></P>



<P>Like Talk, Chat isn't available from every computer on the Internet because computers need special software to join in. Many can, however, and those that can't may be able to go through computers called &quot;public IRC servers&quot; that will give 
them access to Chat sessions.



<BR></P>



<P>Users enter a series of commands to find computers currently running Chat sessions. They then get a list of Chat sessions underway; the sessions are called channels (after the CB channels chatted on by truckers and radio buffs) and are labeled by 
topic. When users see a topic that interests them, they type a command to join and then type another command to choose a nickname. All of their contributions to the discussion will be labeled with the nickname in the session.



<BR></P>



<P>Nicknames allow people in the session to keep track of who's who and to chat with anonymity&#151;which is sometimes a good idea, given the level to which the conversation can sink in Chat groups. Chat sessions are notoriously trivial, and sometimes 
degenerate into petty squabbles or sexually suggestive banter&#151;much more boring than it sounds. Chats can be fun and informative, but also they're too often frequented by people who really ought to get back to work or get out more often.

<BR>There is another way people interact instantly on the Internet: MUDs. A sort of experiment in virtual reality, MUDs are elaborate role-playing games wherein multiple people (mudders&#151;did you guess?) simultaneously interact within an environment 
described through on-screen messages&#151;a kind of electronic Dungeons &amp; Dragons, with at least 500 variations on the Internet.



<BR>



<BR>For more about MUDs, see Chapter 8.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>They Subscribe to Mailing Lists</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>Internet mailing lists (sometimes also called discussion lists) are exactly that: lists of people who have signed up to receive e-mail related to a given topic.



<BR></P>



<P>Earlier in this chapter, you learned that a person can forward to another user e-mail that he or she receives. A mailing list is a special Internet address that automatically forwards every e-mail message it receives to everybody on the list. People 
with something to contribute or a question to ask send e-mail to the mailing list, and within a few hours, everyone on the list receives a copy of that message.



<BR></P>



<P>Users sign up for mailing lists simply by sending an e-mail message to the list's Internet address, asking to join. Many mailing lists are run completely by computer; even the job of signing up new users is run by computer. These lists, sometimes 
called listserv lists or simply listservs to distinguish them from other mailing lists, require joiners to phrase the request in a special word order so that the computer recognizes it as a request to join.



<BR></P>



<P>Here's a very small sampling of what's offered, mailing lists catering to the interests of_



<BR></P>



<P>Kite enthusiasts</P>



<P>Romania buffs</P>



<P>Hemingway fans</P>



<P>Buddhists</P>



<P>Chemists</P>



<P>Beekeepers</P>



<P>Mathematicians</P>



<P>Drag racers</P>



<P>Baseball fans</P>



<P>Photographers</P>



<P>Accordion players



<BR></P>



<P>. . .and much more. There are also many foreign-language mailing lists wherein users from all over the world can exchange news and information in the language they know, love, or study.



<BR></P>

<BR>



<BR>Sometimes mailing lists and newsgroups are unmoderated; that is, nobody's running the show and every message is posted or sent out to subscribers, whether it's worthwhile (and decent) or not.



<BR>



<BR>Other mailing lists and newsgroups, however, are moderated by a person who reads messages before they get sent out to the list or posted to the newsgroup. Messages he or she judges irrelevant or in bad taste don't make it through to the subscribers.



<BR>



<BR>Some Internet users decry moderation as an infringement of free speech on the Internet. Many who have experienced unmoderated mailing lists and newsgroups, however, value moderation as a necessary hedge against free crap.



<BR>



<BR>For example, I have visited both unmoderated and moderated newsgroups dedicated to humor. There are so many messages on the unmoderated newsgroups, and so many of them are stupid, sick, or simply unfunny, that most readers would, I think, quickly give 
up and quit reading. The moderated humor newsgroups had far fewer messages, and a generally higher caliber of humor.



<BR>



<BR>Even the humor on the moderated newsgroups is unprintable, though&#151;which may give you an idea how bad the unmoderated humor newsgroups are.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>They Post and Read Messages in Newsgroups</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>There's a danger in mailing lists: They can get too big and too active, burying users in daily e-mail. That's why some people prefer newsgroups, a different way of obtaining the same kinds of information supplied by mailing list.



<BR></P>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<NOTE>



<IMG SRC="more.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Really Curious?</B>



<BR>



<BR>Many people use newsgroups through an Internet software tool called a newsreader. In Chapter 5, you can see what a newsgroup message looks like when viewed with a newsreader.



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>Like mailing lists, newsgroups center around a particular topic. They don't, however, send out e-mail to members. Instead, the newsgroup member must go to the newsgroup to read new messages, search for messages on a given topic, or post new messages 
(although new messages can be posted through e-mail or right at the newsgroup). Typically, users go to the newsgroup at regular intervals, browse through the new messages and read the messages that interest them, post a new contribution, and maybe reply to 
a query that appears in a message.



<BR></P>



<P>The advantage to this more passive approach is that a user who gets too busy or goes away for a few days doesn't have to deal with hundreds of messages piling up in his or her e-mail box, as might be the case with a mailing list. The user can ignore 
the newsgroup when necessary and then get caught up when he or she has the time. The mailing list, however, provides its own advantage. When something important happens, mailing list users find out quickly. Newsgroup users stay in the dark until they go 
looking for news.



<BR></P>

<BR>



<BR>Newsgroup names use their own little category system to help indicate what they're about. The general category the newsgroup covers is indicated first, followed by a period. After the period comes one word or more, each of which makes the newsgroup 
more specific. For example, the newsgroup called



<BR>



<BR>sci.physics.research



<BR>



<BR>falls under the broad category of science, in which there are many other newsgroups; then under a subcategory of physics, of which there are several; then under research, of which there is only one.



<BR>



<BR>A few popular newsgroup categories are 



<BR>



<BR>sci.&#151;Science



<BR>



<BR>comp.&#151;Computers



<BR>



<BR>news.&#151;Information about Usenet and its newsgroups



<BR>



<BR>soc.&#151;Social issues



<BR>



<BR>rec.&#151;Sports, hobbies, fandom, and other recreational activities



<BR>



<BR>alt.&#151;&quot;Alternative&quot; information and points of view from outside the mainstream. This is where users find the wild stuff, like the newsgroup for people who hate Barney the dinosaur or reviews of new counterculture tomes.



<BR>



<BR>misc.&#151;&quot;Potpourri,&quot; as they say on Jeopardy.



<BR>



<BR>clari.&#151;News collected and supplied by ClariNet communications, including popular syndicated columnists like Dave Barry. (ClariNet newsgroups are among the rare Internet resource users have to pay for.)



<BR></NOTE>



<HR ALIGN=CENTER>



<P>You may see newsgroups, as a set, referred to by other names, such as Usenet news or network news. That's because the newsgroups are managed by a subset of Internet computers called, collectively, Usenet. The various Usenet sites handle the job of 
managing and administering the newsgroups and of keeping them all updated. Thousands of individual newsgroups exist, some serious (soc.rights.human), others practical (misc.jobs.offered), and still others just for fun (rec.arts.startrek.info).



<BR></P>



<P>One great advantage of newsgroups is that the Usenet sites maintain directories containing lists of newsgroup names. With a newsreader or any software program that can search through files of text, users can quickly search the lists for a newsgroup 
whose name contains a certain word, and in doing so they can find newsgroups related to a particular topic. For example, one might type spain and find the names of all the newsgroups with spain in their name. Using a newsreader, users can jump right into 
any newsgroup they find in the search, sign up, and see what's happening.

<BR>



<BR>Sometimes, when a newsgroup and a mailing list share the same topic, they are linked by a gateway. The gateway automatically posts all the mailing list messages on the newsgroup or automatically sends out every new newsgroup posting as an e-mail 
message to the mailing list. This helps make sure that all the news and other communication about a given subject gets to everyone who has declared an interest.



<BR>



<BR>It also means users don't subscribe to both the mailing list and the newsgroup when a gateway exists. Doing so would result in somewhat heavy d&#233;j&#224; vu.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>They Find Each Other Through Directory Services</B>



<BR></FONT></A></H3>



<P>Because of Usenet's directory, newsgroups are easy to find; and when it comes to the Internet, &quot;easy to find&quot; is not an often-used phrase.



<BR></P>



<P>In particular, people have trouble finding one another's



<BR>e-mail addresses so they can easily send a message or initiate a Talk session. Unfortunately, there is no all-powerful, all-encompassing White Pages in which a user can look up another user's Internet address.



<BR></P>



<P>Not to state the obvious_OK, I'll state the obvious_for getting the Internet address of someone he or she already knows or the address of someone at a known place of employment, an Internet user's best bet is to pick up the telephone, call the person, 
and ask. It contradicts some of the wonders of Internet use, but if the user writes the number down, he or she won't have to call again.



<BR></P>



<P>Users can also get addresses from e-mail they receive and from newsgroup messages, both of which show the Internet address of the sender in the header blurb at the top of the message.



<BR></P>



<P>There are, however, Internet facilities that can help. Many Internet computers have on them the software to support two special commands: whois and finger.



<BR></P>



<P>The whois command, the more powerful of the two, allows users to find contact information about another Internet user by name. Doing so involves using the Internet to access another computer (see Chapter 7) and running the whois program there. Nearly 
100 computers are available for this purpose, and their records about users vary&#151;so whois is far from foolproof and far from complete. For those who are running out of options, however, it's a start.



<BR></P>



<P>The exact way a user operates whois varies according to the computer running the whois program. But typically, the user accesses the computer and types whois and the name of the person. If that computer has information about that user, it will display 
the information. Sometimes the display includes not only the desired user's Internet address, but also his or her work mailing address and telephone number. The whois command can also supply information about a specific computer or network on the Internet.




<BR></P>



<P>The finger command is less powerful, because the user has to know the Internet name of the computer used by the person being sought. To put it another way, if the user knows the part of the address following the @ symbol, finger can help him or her 
find the first part to complete the address. That's not much help, but it's something.



<BR></P>



<P>Failing all else, users sometimes leave a message in a newsgroup called soc.net.people, requesting information on the Internet whereabouts of a particular user. They don't often get a complete answer, but they sometimes get close enough to then use 
whois or finger to find the rest.

<P>The Internet opens a world of interpersonal communication, and it supplies this communication in several different forms:



<BR></P>



<UL>



<LI>E-mail, the sending of letter-like messages to other Internet users, to users of other information systems, and even to fax machines



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Talk, an interactive, one-to-one conversation between two users



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Chat, an interactive conversation among multiple users, typically centered around a discussion topic



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Mailing lists, the automatic sending of e-mail messages on a given topic to a list of users who have asked to be kept informed



<BR>



<BR></LI>



<LI>Newsgroups, open forums about a given subject, in which users post messages that can be read and responded to by anyone else



<BR>



<BR></LI></UL>



<P>You also know that communicating on the Internet depends heavily on knowing the Internet addresses of others. The Internet does not, alas, supply an easy way to track down any individual user. There are, however, several directory services that help 
Internet users find one another.
