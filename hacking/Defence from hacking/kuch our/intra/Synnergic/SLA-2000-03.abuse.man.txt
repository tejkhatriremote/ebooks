        Synnergy Laboratories Advisory SLA-1999-3

NAME

       abuse.man webmanager direct path vulnerability

AFFECTED
 
  Linux


SYNOPSIS

  Synnergy Labs has found a serious security problem in abuse.man webmanager
  kit that allows remote and local users to execute arbitary commands on the 
  webserver as the uid of the httpd.


DESCRIPTION

  A carefully constructed url, an attacker could potentially exploit this CGI
  leading to a root compromise.

  abuse.man used the following absolute path as the url to bring up the base 
  page. http://server.com/file=/disk1/e/domain/public_html/index.html&
  domain=hostname.com&script=/index.html

  As we can see, $file shows the actual server side directory that the cgi and 
  index page resides in. The $domain has been modified for security purposes, 
  but this variable displays the vhost name. The $script variable opens the 
  default home page html file.

  Hence, by modifying the $file variable we could then be allowed to view or 
  execute commands as the httpd.

  Eg: file=/disk1/e/domain/public_html/../../../../../../etc/hosts&

  Now by a carefully constructed url, we are able to pipe arbitary commands to 
  the server, since this cgi is perl based:

  Eg: file=/disk1/e/domain/public_html/../../../../../../bin/ls+/|&

  The contents of the root directory were thus displayed.
 

SOLUTION


  An email was sent to the manufacturers website regarding this bug
  in detail, with information of how to fix the problem. We have been
  informed that the problem has now been patched.

  By patching the abuse.man cgi, the webmaster could verify all user
  input and use relative links rather than absolute paths to avoid this
  potential exploitation.
