The mailtool program is installed setgid mail by default in Solaris,
a buffer overrun exists in the OPENWINHOME environment variable. By
specifying a long environment buffer containing machine executable code,
it is possible to execute arbitrary command(s) as gid mail.

The vulnerability in mailtool incorrectly handles data from the OPENWINHOME
environment variable, if this variable exceeds a predefined length a stack 
overflow can occur.

 bash-2.03# mailtool
