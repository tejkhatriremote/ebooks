        Synnergy Laboratories Advisory SLA-1999-2

NAME

       meta.pl CGI hardcoded link vulnerability

AFFECTED
 
  UNIX


SYNOPSIS

  Synnergy Labs has found a bug in the meta.pl (www.cgi-access.com) that allows 
  remote users to view arbitary files with httpd privilidges.


DESCRIPTION

  Meta Tag Generator uses a hard coded physical path for its output.txt.
  By editing the hidden variable on the html form, a user can view any file on 
  the system,  having the priviledges as the UID of the httpd server.

  The following variable within the HTML source shows this hard coded path to the 
  output.txt in it's VALUE tag.

  <INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=TextFile VALUE="/home/cgi-access/html/meta/output.txt">

  Thus modifying this VALUE will cause the meta.pl form to output the alternate file
  that is defined by the user. Of course this will allow a remote user to view files 
  such as /etc/passwd, if allowed read access to the file.


SOLUTION

  Simplest solution is to use softocded scalar variables for the output.txt in the 
  meta.pl itself so it does not display direct hardcoded links.
  A more effective method is to parse the client side input for disallowed metachars.
