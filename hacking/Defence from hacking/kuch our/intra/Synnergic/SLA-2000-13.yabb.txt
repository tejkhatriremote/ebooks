NAME

       YABB 9.1.2000 NULL-byte vulnerability

AFFECTED
 
  Windows
  Linux
  UNIX


SYNOPSIS

  Synnergy Labs has discovered a vulnerability in YABB formum that allows
  a remote user to view any arbitrary file as the UID of the HTTPD by 
  appending a NULL byte using the CGI script options.


DESCRIPTION

  YaBB is the internet's second Open Source Bulletin Board system. A
  Bulletin Board is software to add interactivity to your site. Someone
  can post a question, which other visitors can answer. A bulletin board
  keeps your visitors coming back
  This product can be downloaded from http://www.yabb.org

  1) When YaBB.pl is called with the variable $display  and  $num (this is

  the variable that handles the file) it opens a file without any security

  check for reading, allthough the script that is responsible for handling

  the file, appends a .txt extension, a user is able to force the script to
  open any file he wants by adding %00 to the end of the request, thus
  forcing the script to ommit the .txt extension.
  The problem is located within the Display.pl script:

  sub Display {
    $viewnum = $INFO{'num'};
    open(FILE, "$vardir/membergroups.txt");
    &lock(FILE);
    @membergroups = <FILE>;
    &unlock(FILE);
    close(FILE);
    open(FILE, "$datadir/$viewnum.txt") || &fatal_error("$txt{'23'}

  Note that the program is subject to more Vulnerabities as most of the scripts 
  that handle user input don't do any security checks (even the basic ones).


  For instance:
  http://www.my_target.com/cgi-bin/YaBB.pl?board=news&action=display&
  num=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00

  .. will open the passwd file.
 

SOLUTION

  The vendors have been informed of the bug.

  Wait for the next patched version of YaBB to be released.
