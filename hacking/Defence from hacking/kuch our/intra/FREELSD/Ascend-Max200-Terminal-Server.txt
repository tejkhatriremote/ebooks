I first came across the Max200 Terminal Server about 5 months ago when I found it whilst 
scanning with Toneloc. I didn't know much about it and so started asking around. It 
seemed a lot of people had seen them before, but no-one really knew too much about them. 
Then, Vortex gave me an 0171 (London) number of a Max200 Terminal Server which had a 
direct connection to the net. I played around a bit but didn't really get anywhere, I 
then forgot all about it until very recently when Hybrid found another one. I started to 
investigate.

How do I know I've got a MAX200?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll know you've found a Max200 because of the very obvious greeting:

** Ascend MAX200 Terminal Server **

At this point you will usually have the default prompt which looks a bit like this:

ascend%

Now this doesn't really help you too much because these can be changed quite easily via 
the 'local' command which I will talk about later. The first thing you should do when 
confronted with a new system is type 'help' or '?'. 


What commands are there?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Max200 is very kind to the hacker because typing '?' gives you a lovely list of all 
the available commands:

?                   Display help information
help                   "     "        "
quit                Closes terminal server session
hangup                 "      "       "       "

local               Go to local mode
remote              remote <station>
set                 Set various items. Type 'set ?' for help
show                Show various tables. Type 'show ?' for help
iproute             Manage IP routes.  Type 'iproute ?' for help
dnstab              Manage local DNS table.  Type 'dnstab ?' for help

ping                ping <host-name>
ipxping             ipxping <server-name>
traceroute          Trace route to host.  Type 'traceroute -?' for help
rlogin              rlogin [ -l user -ec ] <host-name> [ -l user ]
open                open < modem-number | slot:modem-on-slot >
resume              resume virtual connect session
close               close virtual connect session
ara                 ARA command


As you can see, the 'ping' command is available, this is extremely helpful as you can 
tell straight away whether or not you have a connection to the net by simply pinging your
favourite domain, I decided to ping darkcyde.org. If you are lucky then it will start to 
ping the domain you chose.

The next thing you want to do is type 'show iproutes', this will give you the IP of the 
Ethernet and the WAN/LAN. The foreign IP may or may not point to an internet domain so 
write it down and try a dns lookup next time your on the net. If you can ping outside 
domain via the 'ping' command then the chances are the foreign address will point to a 
domain. Try connecting to it via Telnet, this can be done within the Max200 by typing 
'telnet <ip address>'. The 'open' command opens one of the PCMCIA modems which can then 
be used to connect to outside systems, which can then be hacked by you. This is actually 
quite a good idea, although the Ascend has CLID software, if you have routed your call, 
you should be fine and this will be just another 'hop' on your route.

Have a good look at all the commands, they are all very straight forward. The 'local' 
command is very interesting, firstly is connects to an IP address then it starts some 
kind of telnet session with the host computer, from here you can view all of the Ethernet
settings (and change them) including system passwords, telnet passwords and SLIP, PPP, 
ARA allowance, ie. you can allow them when they were origionally disabled. Have a good 
look around, this file isn't meant to give you step-by-step instructions on how to hack 
the Max200, you should be able to do that yourself, it is meant to point you in the right 
directions and give you info on the commands available etc. Read everything and you 
should have a good knowledge of the system.


Basic Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Max200 is a multiprotocol, eight-port WAN access switch with an Ethernet connection. 
Each of the eight PCMCIA slots will accomodate modem and ISDN cards. The basic package 
also includes Ascend's MAX operating syetm which is widely used by ISPs around the globe.

The Max200 is designed with Win95, Win3.x and the Mac in mind and so is good for the 
newbie/lamer to have a look at as they usually have Windblows running on their boxes.


What is the basic hardware setup?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Max200 uses the AMD29200 microprocessor operating at 16MHz and supports 4MB dynamic 
RAM, 2MB flash memory and 128KB of battery-backed static RAM.


Multi-protocol?, what protocols are supported?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Max200 supports SLIP (Serial Line Interface Platform) , PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) 
and ARAP (AppleTalk Remote Access Protocol) for wide-area communications. LAN protocols 
include TCP/IP and Novell IPX. In Windows 95, the built in PPP driver (called "Dial- up 
Networking"), and the IP and IPX protocols are fully supported. For earlier Windows 3.x 
versions, a PPP driver and the Novell NetWare drivers (VLM version) are provided as part 
of a MAXLink client software package.


Other cool Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modem dial-out was released in the 4.5C software release. It requires the MAXDial client 
software, included free, for PCs. The support for this feature depends upon the type of 
modem technology being used by the PCMCIA manufacturer. All approved modem vendors will 
be capable of supporting the dial out capability. To use this feature for fax outdial, 
the Max200 must be set up for hardware handshake.

This basically means that you can use the Max200 to dial out of via one of eight PCMCIA 
modem/ISDN slots. So in hax0r terms, it is theoretically a safe  place to hack from.


How can I test out the Max200?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ascend actually have test systems that they let prospective buyers dial in to to check 
out how they work etc. They are only available to US residents, but with the aid of a PBX
you can also check them out, here are the numbers:

	Charleston,SC 			803-746-9962 
	Norfolk, VA 			757-391-9356 
	D.C. Area (Pentagon) 		703-614-3341 
	San Diego, CA 			619-523-8805 
	La Mesa, CA 			619-465-2801 
	Escondido, CA 			760-738-9726 
	Carlsbad, CA 			760-931-9948 
	Carlsbad, CA 			760-931-9948 
	Pearl City, HI 			808-453-4231 
	Philadelphia, PA 		215-214-8181 

These will all assume you are using a PPP connection as this is the Max200 standard.


Max200 Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Max200 has advanced CLID software, for those of you don't know what CLID is, then it 
is CallerID, if you dial into the system directly then they will know who you are for 
sure. Your only hope might be to use ISDN to dial in as the Max200 seems to have some 
sort of problem with recording a number of 9999-999999 or something along those lines. 
This system though is very flexible and can be configured to only accept incoming calls 
from certian masks, or even individual numbers.

The Ascend uses a RADIUS authentication server. Currently this server authenticates 
against your mailhome machine using "rpw". This is the same way that the Annex worked. 
This means that in order to use the Ascend, you need to have your mailhome on one of the 
machines that is running rpwd. So, if you can log into the Annex (0800-891-882) now, the 
Ascend will work just the same. For more info on the RADIUS authentication server, go to 
the following URL:

http://www.shore.net/%7Edreaming/ascend-faq/ascend-faq-q24.html

Basically, be very careful when dialling into the Max200, make sure you route your call 
first via pbx/vmb, even though this isn't totally secure, it should help. Read my file 
ph_anon.txt for more info on how to avoid getting caught phreaking, it all applies to 
call-routing whilst hacking as well.


The Max200 and Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're a hardcore Linux user and on't want to try and connect using Winshit then here 
are a couple of URLs where you'll find a PPP script that works fine:

http://www.nosc.mil/nci/html/rmlinux.html

The Max200 and FreeBSD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

None of the following was written by myself, it is a letter written to the Ascend team 
regarding FreeBSD and the Max200:

Hi Ron--

these work, assuming the use of /usr/sbin/pppd which logs v2.2.0
(available as part of the 2.2-960501-SNAP and later releases--
Susan can ftp a copy of it from here if you'd like a binary for
your friends who are also trying to use this system and wish not
to struggle. Firing it up produces a library version warning
message when run of 2.1.0 systems. Ignore the message)

my main script: /etc/ppp/ppp0
/usr/sbin/pppd /dev/cuaa4 115200 persist passive crtscts modem defaultroute
noipdefault name Pwireless connect /etc/ppp/ppp-on disconnect /etc/ppp/ppp-off

the dialup chat script: /etc/ppp/ppp-on
#!/bin/sh

/usr/bin/chat  -v  ABORT BUSY ABORT "NO CARRIER" "" ATDT5238805 CONNECT "\c"

and the disconnect script: /etc/ppp/ppp-off
#!/bin/csh

/sbin/route delete default
# /sbin/route delete 128.49.236.10

There's a new man page for this version of pppd, can also be provided
if you so desire....

Also, you now can probably back down the "wait until login" timer to
the 3-sec you had before. I think this fires off right away on CONNECT.

Enjoy!!

best regards/bob



Administrative Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can use the administrative commands and profiles, you must authenticate and 
administrative login. To use the "admin" login created by the system:

	admin> auth admin
	Password:

The password default is 'Ascend', and yes, you'll be surprised at how many admins don't 
bother to change it. If this fails then try 'extra' (don't ask me why), and then the 
usual stuff like 'admin', 'sysop'..etc.
