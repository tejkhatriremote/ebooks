<BR>There are just a few basic commands you need to learn, and then some unix
<BR>programs that will aid you in logging in logging into or keeping access
to
<BR>the machine.
<BR>
<BR>Call your local internet service provider and ask them to sell you a shell
<BR>account so that you will have something to practice on to learn these
<BR>basic commands.&nbsp; The average shell account might cost you $10.00 per
month
<BR>if you don't already get one with your existing account.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A NAME="Basic Commands"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Basic Commands</FONT></B>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>I hope you have a basic knowledge of DOS, that would help a bit, and I
will
<BR>assume that you already do in writing this manual.
<BR>
<BR>DOS Commands you are used to first:
<BR>
<BR>REMEMBER: unix is case sensitive, so if I here use lower case you must
also,
<BR>if I use a space you must also.&nbsp; DOS will let you get away with allot
of things
<BR>but unix will not!
<BR>
<BR>DIR/W&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = ls
<BR>DIR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = ls -l
<BR>DIR/AH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = ls -al&nbsp; AH=(hidden) -al=(include
hidden files as well as regular)
<BR>RENAME&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = mv
<BR>ATTRIB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = chmod
<BR>MD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = mkdir
<BR>RD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = rmdir
<BR>DEL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = rm
<BR>COPY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = cp
<BR>
<BR>These are the basic commands, i suggest that you lookup the man pages
<BR>on each one of these commands from your unix shell.&nbsp; You would do
this by
<BR>typing 'man command' without the ''.
<BR>
<BR>each one of these commands will have switches for them, like cp -R to copy
<BR>files and directories.&nbsp; So you would type man cp to get all of the
switches
<BR>you can use with the copy command.
<BR>
<BR>cd {then press enter} will always take you to your home directory
<BR>cp filename $HOME will copy the file to your home directory
<BR>cd ~username will take you to that users home dir if you have access to
be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; there
<BR>pwd {press enter} will show you what directory you are in.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A NAME="Telnet"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Telnet</FONT></B>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>Telnet is a command that you can use from a shell account, or from an exe
<BR>file (telnet.exe) from Windows, OS/2, Windows 95 and other operating systems
<BR>that will let you connect to another machine on the net.&nbsp; There are
other
<BR>programs you will learn about here like FTP, and rlogin that you can use
as well
<BR>but now we will use telnet.
<BR>
<BR>You can use telnet if you know the IP address or the host name you want
to
<BR>connect or login to.&nbsp; To use the command you would just use the telnet
program
<BR>to connect to the IP or host like this:
<BR>
<BR>Telnet netcom.com&nbsp; or&nbsp; telnet 206.146.43.56
<BR>
<BR>Ok, now lets login:
<BR>
<BR>telnet machine.com
<BR>
<BR>trying .....
<BR>
<BR>Connected to machine.com
<BR>
<BR>Linux 2.0.28 (machine.com) (ttyp0)
<BR>
<BR>machine login:username
<BR>password:#######
<BR>
<BR>bash$
<BR>
<BR>Your prompt might look different, but we will use this one.
<BR>
<BR>Notice above that it will tell you the O/S when you get the login prompt.
<BR>You can use this if you get a large collection of passwd files.&nbsp; Even
before
<BR>going on to crack them sort them by O/S types by just telnet-ing to them
to
<BR>see what they are running.&nbsp; There are other ways, but lets keep this
telnet
<BR>topic going for a sec... telnet domain.name.com, after you see what they
are
<BR>running make a note of this and ctrl ] to break out of the connection.
<BR>
<BR>Put all of your linux passwd files into a pile to be cracked first.&nbsp;
All we
<BR>need is one account that works for the system, and we can be almost sure
<BR>we will have root on that machine!&nbsp; There are way to many holes in
linux to
<BR>think we will not be able to own one of those machines, so lets get to
work so
<BR>we can start this wonderful world of hacking.

<BR>
<BR>First notice that we used a / and not \ to change to the tmp directory!
Unix
<BR>uses the / as the root so it is backwards from DOS here.
<BR>Notice we did ls -l for the long directory. If we did 'ls' we would have
what
<BR>you see below.
<BR>
<BR>bash$ ls
<BR>19067haa&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; filter.14428&nbsp; pop3a13598&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
pop3a13600&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; screens
<BR>
<BR>With what we see here can not tell much, so most of the time we will be
<BR>using ls -al with the -al we will see the hidden files also, hidden
<BR>files and directories will always start with a '.'.&nbsp; Now watch:
<BR>
<BR>bash$ ls -al
<BR>total 794
<BR>drwxrwxrwt&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 root&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; root&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<BR>.pinetemp.000 is a hidden file, and .test is a hidden directory.

<BR>row 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; row2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
row3
<BR>----------------------------
<BR>
<BR>Now here we need to learn about permissions, users, and groups.
<BR>
<BR>Row #1 is the file permissions
<BR>Row #2 is who owns the file
<BR>Row #3 is the group owner of the file
<BR>
<BR>File permissions are grouped together into three different groups.
<BR>If the line starts with a d, it is a directory, if there is no d, it is
a file.
<BR>
<BR>- --- --- ---
<BR>| |&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp; |--------> Other = anyone on the machine
can access
<BR>| |&nbsp;&nbsp; |------------> Group = certain groups can access
<BR>| |----------------> User&nbsp; = only the owner can access
<BR>|------------------> Directory Mark
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>- rw- r-- r--
<BR>| |&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp; |--------> Other can only read the file
<BR>| |&nbsp;&nbsp; |------------> Group can only read the file
<BR>| |----------------> User&nbsp; can read or write to the file
<BR>|------------------> It is not a directory
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>- rwx rwx r-x
<BR>| |&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp; |--------> Other can read and execute the
file
<BR>| |&nbsp;&nbsp; |------------> Group can read write and execute the file
<BR>| |----------------> User&nbsp; can read write and execute the file
<BR>|------------------> It is not a directory
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>The owner is the user name in row #2 and the group owner is the name in
row #3.
<BR>In DOS the file has to have a .exe, .com, or .bat extension to execute,
but in
<BR>unix all you need is the --x in your group of user, other, group
<BR>
<BR>You can change these permissions if you own the file or have root access:
<BR>
<BR>---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>chmod oug+r filename will make all three groups of permissions be able
to
<BR>read the file.
<BR>
<BR>chmod og-r filename would make the file readable only to the user that
owns
<BR>the file.&nbsp; (notice the - or + to set the file yes or no)
<BR>
<BR>chmod +x filename would make the file execute by all.
<BR>
<BR>chown username filename would make the file owned by another user.
<BR>chgrp groupname filename would make the file owned by another group.
<BR>---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<BR>Make sure to keep file perm's and groups the same or you will be sniffed
<BR>out and booted from the system.&nbsp; Changing configs on the system might
only
<BR>break other functions, so keep your paws off or you are just asking to
get
<BR>cought.&nbsp; Only do what you are *SURE* of.&nbsp; Only use commands that
you know,
<BR>you might find yourself spending hours fixing just one typo like
<BR>chown -R username /* could keep you busy for a year ;)
<BR>
<BR>Just be careful!
<BR>
<BR>We will get into this stuff more as we go into the needs for this.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A NAME="Rlogin"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Rlogin</FONT></B>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>There is another command you might use and we will get into this elsewhere
<BR>as we get into using rlogin to login to a system without a password.
<BR>
<BR>For now read the man pages on rlogin by using the man rlogin from your
<BR>shell account.
<BR>
<BR>The basic command would be :
<BR>
<BR>rlogin -l username hostname
<BR>connecting....
<BR>password:
<BR>
<BR>bash$
<BR>
<BR>Rlogin requires the user to have a file in their home directory that tells
<BR>what system they can receive the rlogin from.&nbsp; In this file .rhosts
it would
<BR>look like this:
<BR>
<BR>username hostname (or) hostname
<BR>
<BR>if you were to add to this file&nbsp;&nbsp; + +&nbsp;&nbsp; it would let
any user from any host
<BR>login without a password.
<BR>
<BR>The file would look like this:
<BR>
<BR>----- cut here ------
<BR>+ +
<BR>_____ cut here ------
<BR>
<BR>if they already had entry's you could add the + + under their host names,
but
<BR>remember now they would notice seeing they would now be able to rlogin
<BR>without the password.&nbsp; You would be targeting people that did not
<BR>already have a .rhosts file.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A NAME="FTP"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>FTP</FONT></B>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>Another way to login will be FTP.&nbsp; You can use a windows client, or
just
<BR>login from a shell.
<BR>
<BR>ftp ftp.domain.com
<BR>
<BR>This will allow you to download or upload files to the site you are hacking.
<BR>Just make sure to edit the xferlog (see section 6d) to wipe your tracks
<BR>on the system.&nbsp; Remember NEVER to ftp or telnet out of the hacked
system, only
<BR>log into it!&nbsp; If you are coming from your own system, or from another
hacked
<BR>account you might just be giving your login and password to the system
admin
<BR>or another hacker on their system.&nbsp; There could be a telnetd or ftpd
trojan
<BR>loaded on the system, or even a sniffer.&nbsp; Now you would have just
gave someone
<BR>your login id and password.&nbsp; And if this was the system admin, he
might have
<BR>the idea that revenge is sweet ;)
<BR>
<BR>Using ftp from the shell, I would suggest using a few commands:
<BR>
<BR>After you login, and have your prompt, type these commands
<BR>pressing enter after each one.
<BR>
<BR>prompt
<BR>hash
<BR>bin
<BR>
<BR>prompt will allow you to type a command like (mget *) or (mput*) and transfer
<BR>an entire directory without having it prompt you for each file yes or no.
<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
hash marks
<BR>hash will put ############ on the screen so you can see the transfer
<BR>is still moving and at what speed.
<BR>
<BR>bin will make sure you get the files in the right mode, and if transferring
<BR>binary files, you will be sure they will uncompresses.
<BR>
<BR>The transfer commands are easy, get filename, or, put filename, or for
many
<BR>files you can use regular wild cards with mput&nbsp; or mget.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A NAME="GCC Compiler"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>GCC Compiler</FONT></B>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>There will be a time when you will need to compile a .c file.
<BR>
<BR>It is best to compile on the machine you are working on.&nbsp; So upload
or copy
<BR>and past the files to the hacked box and compile them there.&nbsp; If you
have
<BR>problems with their compiler you can try to upload pre-compiled files.
<BR>
<BR>One way to get the file up to the victims machine would be to use copy
<BR>and paste.&nbsp; Get a good tsr or windows shareware program to do this
if
<BR>you do not have any way to do it now.&nbsp; You can copy a script file
from
<BR>one window and paste it into an editor on the victims machine, and then
compile
<BR>the new file.&nbsp; Walaa... no upload log of the file.&nbsp; You can copy
and paste
<BR>from the victims machine as well so that there are no download logs of
ascii
<BR>files.
<BR>
<BR>To copy and paste you can just open an editor on the hacked box, and then
copy
<BR>from your other session, and paste your script into the editor and save
the
<BR>file.&nbsp; This way there will not be anything in the xferlog yet.
<BR>
<BR>You can do the same thing with the password file.&nbsp; If you do decide
to
<BR>download the password file using ftp, make sure to copy it to your home
<BR>directory first under a different name.
<BR>
<BR>bash:/etc:> cp passwd $HOME/plog&nbsp; would copy the file called passwd
from the /etc
<BR>directory you were in, to your home directory in a file called plog instead
of
<BR>passwd.&nbsp; Admin's grep the xfer logs looking for who is downloading
the passwd
<BR>file.
<BR>
<BR>Another way to get file to or from the box without showing up in the logs
<BR>would be to open an irc session on the victims machine, then from your
other
<BR>session where you are already a user on irc, send the files using dcc.
<BR>
<BR>The command to send the files would be /dcc send &lt;nick> &lt;filename>
<BR>The command to get the file on the other side would be /dcc get &lt;nick>
&lt;file>
<BR>
<BR>It would be nice if you had a bot loaded on the irc when you were hacking
so
<BR>that you could just send files to the bot and have it auto receive them.
<BR>
<BR>A 'bot' is a robot program that you can load in the background on your
shell
<BR>account that will receive files, keep channels open, etc...
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>The GCC compiler is easy...
<BR>
<BR>gcc filename.c -o filenameyouwant
<BR>
<BR>If i was to compile a file called z2.c that would zap the log files i would
<BR>type this:
<BR>
<BR>gcc z2.c -o zap
<BR>
<BR>This would give me a file that would exe, called zap
<BR>
<BR>If I just typed : gcc z2.c&nbsp; I would have a file named a.out, that
was the executable
<BR>file and would have to rename it to zap, or some name i would know by doing
<BR>this: mv a.out zap
<BR>
<BR>Now I would have a file named zap that was executable instead of a.out.
<BR>
<BR>You will want to make sure you are not naming these files names that sys
admin's
<BR>will know.&nbsp; If you had a sniffer file called 'linuxsniffer.c' you
don't
<BR>want to keep the same name ;) call it something like:
<BR>
<BR>gcc linuxsniffer.c -o lsn
<BR>
<BR>Remember also sometimes you can execute these files names right in the
directory
<BR>by just typing the file name like for our 'lsn' (sniffer) above just by
<BR>typing lsn.&nbsp; But sometimes this will not work unless you add a ./
to the
<BR>command.&nbsp; So remember, sometimes you will need to type ./lsn&nbsp;
or your file
<BR>name.
<BR>
<BR>Also there will be a time you will want a program to run in the background
<BR>even after you logoff.&nbsp; Like in the case of the sniffer above.&nbsp;
In this case
<BR>you might want to name your sniffer something that would not be so easy
<BR>noticed.&nbsp; Use your own style here.&nbsp; BUT to make it stay in the
background while
<BR>you are off the system you need to run the command with a &amp; after the
command.
<BR>
<BR>lsn&amp;
<BR>
<BR>If you were to just type lsn, your screen would pause, and you would not
be
<BR>able to type while the program was sniffing, but if you typed lsn&amp;
it would
<BR>load and the system prompt would come right back to you.&nbsp; Also the
system
<BR>would let you know it was loaded by giving you the process id # that it
<BR>was loaded as.
<BR>
<BR>You could view the process with the ps -x command, you might want to run
<BR>ps -auxe |more
<BR>
<BR>a= all
<BR>u= show user
<BR>x= yours
<BR>e= env
<BR>
<BR>some machines
<BR>f=tree
<BR>or command: pstree
