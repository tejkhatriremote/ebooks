<H2><A NAME="BuildingBlocksforCreatingaPerfectI"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Building
Blocks for Creating a Perfect Intranet</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Think of the creative process as a building process. Try to build
the roof of the house before you lay the foundation, and you are
going to have serious problems. Pour the concrete for the foundation
of the house before you put in the necessary plumbing for water
and sewer access, and you are going to spend more money than you
bargained for.
<P>
You build a house one step at a time. You ensure the house has
a strong foundation. Buildings with strong foundations tend to
weather the seasons and time. When you are almost done with the
frame of the house, you build a roof. Although the roof of the
house is the top of the structure, you do not stop there. It takes
more than a covered frame to make a house. You hire an electrician
to do the wiring and bring back the plumber to finish the plumbing.
Afterward, you hang plaster board, add insulation, finish the
exterior, add fixtures, and before you know it, you have a house
that you can call home.
<P>
You build an intranet in the same way, one step at a time. Your
start on the intranet is about as glamorous as the water and sewer
pipes waiting for the foundation to be poured around them; for
just when you are ready to roll back your sleeves and dive into
the intranet creation process with both feet, you might discover
you need to conduct research, planning, or consider the requirements
of the intranet. When you finally flesh out the foundation of
the intranet, you start to build the framework.
<P>
The basic components of any intranet are the hardware and software
that make it work. The hardware your intranet uses will determine
the way the intranet operates. The software your intranet uses
will determine what the intranet is used for. Eventually, you
finish designing the intranet, but find you still have to develop
the hot Java-powered applications for the intranet.
<P>
Even when you have completed the design and development processes,
the intranet still is not finished. You check the structure of
the work for flaws. You make sure you have used the right structure
and created the best tools. You examine the fixtures. Once all
this is done, you finally have an intranet worthy of the CEO's
wholehearted embrace.
<P>
Try to build the whole house at once and you will be overwhelmed.
The same is true for any creative process. When you are building
your intranet and its applications, you need to manage many things
on a level of general organization and on a more specific level.
<H3><A NAME="ManagingExpectations">Managing Expectations</A></H3>
<P>
If you mismanage expectations, your intranet might not turn out
as you planned. Your expectations and the expectations of your
superiors might be totally different. Before you start to design
the intranet and the Java-powered applications for the intranet,
make sure your expectations and the expectations of your supervisors
mesh. A good way to do this is to ensure that the communications
channels are open and used.
<P>
To ensure that your project is a smashing success, you should
discuss expectations throughout the development of the intranet,
especially as you develop your intranet applications. If you develop
a rapid prototype of key applications, your superiors should be
the ones to verify that the designs meet their expectations. If
the prototypes do not meet their expectations, maybe the prototypes
were an example of what not to do, or maybe the expectations of
management are unrealistic. If your prototypes meet or exceed
the expectations of your superiors, you have a green light and
your project is well on its way to a successful implementation.
<P>
You should also manage your personal expectations for the intranet
and its applications. Your expectations play a major role in the
success of the intranet. The following is a list of do's and don'ts
to help you manage expectations:
<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Do expect the creation and development
process to be challenging and fun.</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Don't expect first efforts to be perfect.</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Don't expect the intranet to be perfect.</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Do expect to revise and improvise as necessary.</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Do expect to learn a lot.</FONT>
</UL>
<H3><A NAME="ManagingPerceptions">Managing Perceptions</A></H3>
<P>
Realistic expectations ensure the success of your intranet. If
you perceive the intranet as an impossibly large undertaking,
you might cripple yourself mentally. If you perceive the intranet
as a trivial undertaking, you will not produce the best possible
structure and tools for your organization.
<P>
It is best to find a balance in your perceptions about the intranet.
As you begin to design the intranet, keep in mind that the intranet
creation process is a team effort. Few individuals will be able
to handle all aspects of creating the intranet and its applications.
For this reason, you should have an accurate perception of your
abilities and know when it is in the best interest of the project
to delegate tasks.
<H3><A NAME="ManagingStrategies">Managing Strategies</A></H3>
<P>
Creating an intranet is exciting and challenging. You'll be breaking
new ground, trying new things, and experimenting with new applications.
Manage the intranet creation process in whatever way will motivate
you. If one way of thinking about the intranet is not motivating
you, change tactics. Do whatever it takes to get the job done.
<P>
Do not limit yourself to a few strategies or stick with one strategy
when it obviously is not working. Make a list of strategies. If
one strategy is not working, switch to a new one. If you do not
have a new one, create a new one.
<P>
The strategy you use can be very basic. A great strategy to start
with is to plan to work on the project every day until it is completed.
In addition to this strategy, you should add planning to involve
both management and users in the development process. The degree
of involvement for management and users might need to be adjusted
throughout the development process.
<P>
Your role in the project should be a part of your strategy. Initially,
you might want to work closely with the development team. Later,
you might discover that your best role is to manage the development
at a higher level. Or if you are the top programmer or network
administrator, you might find that you need to work on application
design rather than the actual programming. Adapting your role
as necessary can help the project succeed.
<H3><A NAME="ManagingGoals">Managing Goals</A></H3>
<P>
When you start working on the intranet design and creation process,
one of the first things you should do is develop goals. Your goals
should take into consideration the complexities and nuances of
the intranet you plan to develop for your organization. Goals
should be clear and relevant to the problem at hand.
<P>
Set major goals relevant to the purpose, scope, and audience of
the intranet. Also, set minor goals or milestones for the stages
of the intranet development and its applications.
<P>
Goals and milestones help define the intranet development process
as a series of steps or achievements. One major goal could be
to complete the planning of the intranet; another major goal could
be to complete the design of the intranet.
<P>
The series of steps necessary to complete the major goals are
the minor goals or milestones. Your first milestone will be to
start work on the intranet. Another milestone might be to select
and purchase the necessary intranet software, such as Web server
software, browser software, and a Java Development environment.
Your goals are to complete the major steps of the development
process, such as planning and design. You will learn all about
these major steps later in this chapter in the section titled,
&quot;Mapping Your Intranet in Four Easy Steps.&quot;
<H3><A NAME="ManagingRules">Managing Rules</A></H3>
<P>
As the intranet designer and manager, you will probably create
or be provided rules that pertain specifically to the intranet's
layout or scope of control, such as the Information Systems department
that will have overall responsibility for the intranet after completion.
As you start to create the intranet, these rules might seem perfectly
acceptable. However, as you conduct planning for the intranet
and its applications, you might find that the overall responsibility
of the intranet should be divided amongst the departments that
will set up intranet servers. If these early rules cannot be modified
to fit the current situation, you will have problems. You might
encounter delays due to loss of efficiency or the final product
might not be what was expected.
<P>
No rule should ever be considered absolute. Even the best of rules
should be interpreted as guidelines that can vary depending on
the situation. Rules for a complex project like your intranet
should be flexible and make sense. A rule that conflicts with
something you are trying to do should be reexamined. The rule
might be inappropriate for the situation you are trying to apply
it to.
<H3><A NAME="ManagingBehavior">Managing Behavior</A></H3>
<P>
Your intranet will never be implemented if you avoid working on
it. Putting off work until something is due is a poor practice.
Quitting when things do not go your way or when you seem to have
a block is another poor practice.
<P>
Even if you thrive on deadlines, plan to work toward intranet's
goals and milestones regularly-every day if necessary and possible.
You should also plan to work on the intranet and its applications
during those times when your thoughts are not flowing. Everyone
has bad days and good days. Some days you take more breaks. Some
days you work straight through the day and into the night.
<P>
You might tend toward other destructive behavior besides avoiding
or putting off work. Sometimes programmers go to the opposite
extreme. They tear things apart impulsively before letting the
work cool off so they can look at it objectively. Never hack your
code just because a few users didn't like your application's interface.
<H2><A NAME="DeterminingtheBestOrganizationforYo"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Determining
the Best Organization for Your Intranet</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Managing the aspects of the intranet's design and creation is
only the beginning. The next step is to determine the best organization
for your intranet. Over the years, three models have developed
for information systems like your intranet: centralized, decentralized,
and a combination of centralized and decentralized.
<H3><A NAME="LearningfromthePast">Learning from the Past</A></H3>
<P>
The three computing models are really driven by the types of computers
in use at an organization. Following the centralized model, all
computer resources are centered in one location and under the
management of one organization. When you think of centralized
computing, think of mainframes and computer centers.
<P>
With the introduction of file server and client server computing,
most organizations moved away from the centralized model toward
a decentralized model. In decentralized computing, computer resources
are spread throughout the organization and under the management
of the departments in which the computers are located. When you
think of decentralized computing, think of the high-power workstations
and servers.
<P>
After the big move to decentralize computer resources and dismantle
massive computer centers, many managers had a rude awakening to
the anarchy decentralized computing can cause. Imagine an organization
where each department sets the rules and decides the standards,
like what hardware and software to purchase and how that hardware
and software should be set up. Then imagine the nightmare of trying
to support the gauntlet of software and hardware installed throughout
an organization the size of AT&amp;T.
<P>
Because of a lack of control with decentralized computing, many
organizations are moving to the happy middle ground of a mixed
computing model. In this mixed model, a centralized Information
Systems management sets broad policy, such as the direction and
purpose of key computing initiatives, and the individual departments
are free to work within those guidelines.
<H3><A NAME="ApplyingthePasttoYourIntranetsFut">Applying the Past
to Your Intranet's Future</A></H3>
<P>
As you discuss the implementation of the intranet with management,
keep the three computing models in mind. While your organization
might currently use a specific model, you can apply any of the
models to the design of your intranet and should encourage management
to choose the model that will best serve your organization. Ideally,
the final decision will be based on the necessary responsibility
and control of the intranet resources.
<P>
Following a centralized model, a specific department within the
organization will be responsible for the intranet. This same department
will be responsible for the setup, design, and administration
of your intranet servers. The department will also be responsible
for creating the necessary publications and applications based
on user requests.
<P>
With a centralized model, there will usually be a formal approval
process for new publications, applications and services. This
means that if the Human Resources department wanted an application
to track employee files, a formal request would be required. Once
the request is approved, the intranet developers would work with
Human Resources to create the application. The problem with centralized
control and formal approval processes is that they put creativity
and timeliness in thumbscrews. Can you imagine having to get formal
approval to change the dates in an intranet published memo?
<P>
Following a decentralized model, each department within the organization
is responsible for its section of the intranet. All departments
that want to create intranet services will have to set up, design
and administer their own intranet servers. Each department will
also be responsible for creating the publications and applications
used by the department.
<P>
When you use a decentralized model, you cut out the formal approval
process for new publications, applications, and services. This
means anyone can create intranet resources. Greater freedom and
few controls means that new services can be set up quickly by
anyone who wants to set them up. This freedom and lack of controls
can also lead to abuse of the intranet resources. Who do you blame
when someone publishes potentially offensive material or when
the usefulness of the intranet deteriorates because so much junk
has been created?
<P>
By adopting elements of both the centralized and decentralized
model that fit the needs of the organization, you might be able
to balance the need for strict control with the need for creative
freedom. For example, you could create an intranet with a centralized
Web server that links together departmental servers. The IS staff
would be responsible for maintaining the central server and updating
links to resources throughout the organization. The individual
departments would be responsible for maintaining their own servers.
To ensure the intranet is not abused, one person within each department
could be responsible for that department's intranet resources.
<H2><A NAME="CreatingContentforYourIntranet"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Creating
Content for Your Intranet</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
The real stars on your intranet are the applications you plan
to develop. Still, you will need content for your intranet. Most
of your content will be in the form of hypertext documents that
are served by your Web server and displayed by your chosen Web
browser.
<P>
As you consider the type of content you want to publish on your
intranet, think about how you will organize that content. You
can organize hypertext documents in many ways. The structure that
is best for a particular document depends on the complexity of
the material you plan to present. As complexity increases, you
manage it by adopting a more advanced structuring method. Specific
design models for hypertext documents include
<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Linear</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Linear with alternative paths</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Hierarchical</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Combinations of linear and hierarchical</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Integrated web</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
For a small document with limited complexity, a simple structure
is often best. Simple structures include linear and linear with
alternative paths. The simplest way to structure a hypertext document
is in a <I>linear</I> fashion. Using a pure linear structure,
you can create a hypertext publication with a structure resembling
a traditional print publication. Readers move forward and backward
in sequence through the pages of the publication.
<P>
An <I>alternative path</I> structure gives readers more options
or paths through a document. By providing alternative paths, you
make the structure of the publication more flexible. Instead of
being able to move only forward and backward through the publication,
readers can follow a branch from the main path. In a linear structure
the branches will rejoin the main path at some point.
<P>
The <I>hierarchical</I> structure is the most logical structure
for a publication of moderate complexity. In this structure, you
organize the publication into a directory tree. Readers can navigate
through the publication, moving from one level of the publication
to the next, more detailed, level of the publication. They can
also go up the tree from the detailed level to a higher level
and possibly jump to the top level.
<P>
The directory tree closely resembles the way you store files on
your hard drive in a main directory with subdirectories leading
to files. You could also think of the hierarchy as a representation
of an actual tree. If you invert the tree, the trunk of the tree
would be the top level of the publication. The trunk could be
the overview of the publication. The large boughs leading from
the trunk would be the next level of the document structure. The
boughs could be chapter overview pages. Branches leading from
the boughs would be the next level, or the pages within chapters.
<P>
A <I>combined</I> <I>linear and hierarchical</I> structure is
one of the most used forms for hypertext publications. This is
because it is an extremely flexible, but still highly structured
method. Readers can move forward and backward through individual
pages. They can navigate through the various levels of the publication
by moving up a level or descending to the next level. They can
also follow parallel paths through the document.
<P>
The most complex structuring method is the <I>integrated web</I>.
This method lets the reader follow multiple paths from many options.
This is a good method to use when you want the reader to be able
to browse or wander many times through the publication you have
created. Each time through the publication, readers will probably
discover something new.
<H2><A NAME="IntranetDevelopmentTools"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Intranet
Development Tools</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
After considering the various styles for hypertext documents,
you should examine the various tools you will need to develop
the intranet. A tool is anything that supports the task you are
working on. The tools for unleashing the power of your intranet
are based on the existing tools for the Internet itself, which
includes protocols, resource tools, and information services.
<H3><A NAME="ImplementingTCPIPNetworking">Implementing TCP/IP
Networking</A></H3>
<P>
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol) is the
foundation of the worldwide Internet. You must install TCP/IP
on your network to enable intranet services.
<P>
A protocol is a set of rules for programs communicating on the
network. It specifies how the programs talk to each other and
what meaning to give to the data they receive. Without TCP/IP
setting the rules for your network communications, you cannot
use Internet technologies.
<P>
The good news is that if your organization already has access
to the World Wide Web, you might already have the necessary TCP/IP
structure in place. Additionally, TCP/IP is built in to some operating
systems, including Windows 95, Windows NT, and most variants of
UNIX.
<P>
If you have an operating system where TCP/IP is not built in and
do not have TCP/IP installed, you will need to purchase TCP/IP
software. Fortunately, TCP/IP software is widely available from
software vendors. For example, if you want to install TCP/IP on
a Macintosh, you can obtain the software directly from Apple or
third-party vendors.<BR>

<H3><A NAME="CreatingWebServiceswithHTTP">Creating Web Services
with HTTP</A></H3>
<P>
An intranet without Web services is like a world without water.
The key to the World Wide Web is the hypertext transfer protocol.
<P>
HTTP offers a means of moving from document to document, or of
indexing within documents. Accessing documents published on your
intranet involves communications between browsers and servers.
<P>
In a browser, such as the Netscape Navigator, the HTTP processes
are virtually transparent to the user. All the user really has
to do is activate links to move through your Web presentation.
The browser takes care of interpreting the hypertext transfer
commands and communicating requests.<BR>
<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDERCOLOR=#000000 BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>
<TR><TD><B>Tip</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To reduce time spent on training and support, you might want to select a single browser package for use on the intranet. Before selecting a specific browser package for your intranet, you should ensure the developer of the browser makes versions for all 
the operating systems in use on your network. If the developer does not, you might want to consider another browser.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The mechanism on the receiving end, which is processing the requests,
is a program called the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Daemon (HTTPD).
A daemon is a UNIX term for a program that runs in the background
and handles requests. The HTTP daemon resides on your Web server.
<P>
Before setting up or installing server software, you must determine
what platform the Web server will run on. Until recently, your
choices were limited, but this changed rapidly as the World Wide
Web grew in popularity. Today, Web server software and server
management tools are available for almost every platform. And,
like other software developed for use on the Internet, this software
is available as freeware, shareware, and commercial software.
<P>
You will find that UNIX platforms have the most options for server
software. Until recently, there was only one good choice for the
Windows NT environment, but this has changed. There are now many
excellent commercial and freeware choices for Windows NT. For
other platforms, there is generally only one choice in server
software. Having only one choice of server software for your Macintosh
or Windows system doesn't mean the quality of the server software
is poor. Quite the contrary, the quality of the software is often
quite good.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="IntranetDevelopersResourceTools"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Intranet
Developer's Resource Tools</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Tools are an essential part of any operation. Resource tools provide
the means for sending and retrieving information. There are three
basic tools of intranet working:
<P>
<B>E-Mail:</B> Electronic mail is a great way to communicate.
Think of e-mail as a way to send letters to anyone within the
company instantly. Many e-mail programs enable delivery of mail
to single users or groups of users. Some e-mail programs even
provide ways to automate responses. Most browser packages are
packaged with e-mail software.
<P>
<B>FTP:</B> File transfer protocol provides the basic means for
delivering and retrieving files around the network. The files
can be text, sound, or graphics. FTP provides a springboard for
many information-based approaches to retrieving information. Many
higher level tools that have friendlier interfaces use FTP or
a protocol similar to FTP to transfer files. Just about every
browser currently available supports FTP.
<P>
<B>Telnet:</B> Telnet lets you remotely log in to another system
and browse files and directories on that remote system. Telnet
is valuable because it is easy to use and basic to the network.
When you telnet to another computer, you can issue commands as
if you were typing on the other computer's keyboard. On some platforms,
like UNIX, telnet is a built-in resource. On other platforms,
you will need a telnet tool.
<P>
The basic resource tools are indispensable when used for the purpose
that they were designed for. They even provide the fundamental
basis for many high-level resource tools, but they simply weren't
designed for the advanced manipulation of the wealth of information
available on the Internet. This is why dozens of information resource
tools have been designed to manipulate networked data.
<P>
Here is a list of high-level resource tools you might want to
use on your intranet:
<P>
<B>Archie</B>: A system to automatically gather, index, and serve
information on the Internet. Archie is a great tool for searching
your intranet's file archives. Once you set up Archie services,
users can access Archie resources with their browser.
<P>
<B>Gopher</B>: A distributed information service that enables
you to move easily through complex webs of network resources.
Gopher uses a simple protocol that enables a Gopher client to
access information on any accessible Gopher server. Most browsers
directly support Gopher.
<P>
<B>LISTSERV</B>: An automated mailing list distribution system.
Users can subscribe to LISTSERV lists you set up on the intranet,
which enables them to read e-mail posted to the list or to post
e-mail to the list. Once you set up a LISTSERV server, users can
join lists and participate in lists using standard Internet e-mail
software. Most browser packages include e-mail software.
<P>
<B>Usenet</B>: A bulletin board system of discussion groups called
<I>newsgroups</I>. Users can participate in newsgroups posting
messages to the group and can read messages posted by other newsgroup
members. Once you set up a newsgroup server, users can browse
newsgroups and post information to newsgroups using a newsgroup
reader. Most browser packages include a newsgroup reader.
<P>
<B>Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS)</B>: A distributed information
service for searching databases located throughout the network.
It offers indexed searching for fast retrieval and an excellent
feedback mechanism that enables the results of initial searches
to influence later searches. WAIS servers are best accessed via
CGI scripts, which allow users to search WAIS databases using
their browser.
<H3><A NAME="HTMLDevelopmentTools">HTML Development Tools</A>
</H3>
<P>
Using HTML development tools, you can quickly and easily create
HTML documents for your intranet. There are three basic types
of HTML development tools for intranet publishing:
<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>HTML editors</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>HTML templates for word processors</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>HTML converters</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
HTML editors have features similar to your favorite word processor
and enable you to easily create documents in HTML format. Typically,
these editors enable you to select HTML elements from a pull-down
menu. The menu has brief descriptions of elements you can add
to the document. The editor places the element in the document
in the proper format, which frees you from having to memorize
the format. When creating complex forms, you'll find HTML editors
especially useful.
<P>
Here is a list of some of the most popular HTML editors:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
FrontPage<BR>
HotDog<BR>
HoTMetaL<BR>
HTML Author<BR>
HTML Writer<BR>
Netscape Gold<BR>
Pagemill/Sitemill
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
HTML templates enable you to add the functionality of an HTML
editor to your favorite word processor. The great thing about
templates is that you can use all the word processor's features,
which could include checking grammar and spelling. More importantly,
you'll be using the familiar features of your word processor to
add HTML formatting to your documents.
<P>
Here are several popular HTML templates:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
ANT_HTML<BR>
EasyHelp/Web<BR>
Internet Assistant
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Although the task of creating HTML code is fairly complex, some
helper applications called <I>converters</I> try to automate the
task. HTML converters convert your favorite document formats into
HTML code and vice versa. At the touch of a button, you could
transform a Word for Windows file into an HTML document. Converters
are especially useful if you're converting simple documents and
are less useful when you're converting documents with complex
layouts.
<P>
You can find HTML converters for every major word processor and
document design application, including BibTeX, DECwrite, FrameMaker,
Interleaf, LaTeX, MS Word, PageMaker, PowerPoint, QuarkXPress,
Scribe, and WordPerfect. HTML converters are available to convert
specific formats, such as ASCII, RTF, MIF, Postscript, and UNIX
MAN pages. There are even converters to convert source code from
popular programming languages to HTML. You can convert your favorite
programs to HTML if they are in these languages: C, C++, FORTRAN,
Lisp, or Pascal.

Now that you know the basics of intranet organization, content
structure, and development tools, you have everything you need
to develop a plan that takes you through the creation and implementation
of your intranet. The best way to start is to break down the plan
into a series of steps, which ensures the intranet development
process is manageable.
<P>
Here are four steps you should follow:
<OL>
<LI>Determining requirements
<LI>Planning
<LI>Designing
<LI>Implementation
</OL>
<H3><A NAME="Step1DeterminingRequirements">Step 1: Determining
Requirements</A></H3>
<P>
In this step, you try to figure out what you need to complete
the intranet design and implementation. You do this by first examining
the intranet's purpose, scope, and audience.
<P>
Your statement of purpose should identify:
<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Why you are building the intranet</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>How the intranet will be used within your
organization</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
When you examine the scope for the intranet, think in terms of
size and focus. Will the intranet be company-wide? What types
of documents, files, and applications will be permitted on the
intranet?
<P>
Your audience for the intranet is your customer base. Your customers
could include all company employees, employees in specific departments,
or employees in a single department.
<P>
Here's a preliminary plan for an intranet within a specific department:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDERCOLOR=#000000 BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>

<TR><TD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All personnel assigned to the regional sales department.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
After determining the purpose, scope, and audience, examine your
reasonable expectations for the completed intranet. You translate
these needs, goals, and purposes into requirements for the intranet.
The basic needs for any intranet are the software development
tools that will help you build the necessary intranet services.
Software tools for implementing your intranet are examined in
the section titled &quot;Intranet Development Tools.&quot;
<P>
You will want to think beyond your software needs and also look
at your hardware needs. Many types of computers are on the market.
The IBM pc and pc compatibles have many generations of computer
systems based on the different chip sets. Some pcs are based on
the 80286, 80386, and 80486 chips. Other pcs are based on the
Intel's Pentium chips. The same is true for Macintoshes-you might
choose from a whole line of PowerMacs. There is even a Powerpc,
a cross between a Mac and a pc. UNIX systems come in many configurations
from Sun Microsystems' popular Sparc workstations to Silicon Graphics
workstations.
<P>
Very often, the best platform for your intranet services is the
platform you are most familiar with. The primary reason for this
is that different computer platforms use different operating systems
and it is the operating system that your intranet services will
run under. If you are unfamiliar with the operating system, there
will be an extended learning curve as you study both the operating
system and the software your intranet runs on.
<P>
Here is a sample plan for hardware and software requirements:
<BR>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Next, you should consider time, budget, and personnel constraints.
If you have only 10 weeks to completely implement the intranet,
you might need to hire additional team members to get the intranet
finished on time. In this case, hiring a specific number of additional
team members would be one of your requirements.
<P>
Here's a sample plan for the initial time, budget, and personnel
requirements:<BR>
<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDERCOLOR=#000000 BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>

If you have a $5000 budget, you will have to scrutinize every
aspect of the budget to keep costs down. In this case, you will
probably be extremely selective about the development tools you
purchase. You will also hire outside help only as necessary. And
if the budget constraints are so severe that they would materially
affect the success of the intranet, you will want to ensure your
superiors are aware of the situation, and possibly make a case
for getting a larger budget.
<H3><A NAME="Step2Planning">Step 2: Planning</A></H3>
<P>
After you determine your requirements for the intranet, you should
plan the intranet. An essential part of planning is determining
how long the project is going to take and the steps necessary
to carry you through the project. For this reason, the planning
step can also be a reality check for constraints or requirements.
<P>
For example, you determine that it will take a minimum of five
months to complete the intranet and install all the necessary
services, yet the deadline for project completion given to you
by management is two months away. Here, something would have to
give and you would have to work hard to manage perceptions and
expectations concerning the intranet. You might have to renegotiate
the deadline, hire additional team members or eliminate certain
time-intensive parts of the intranet.
<P>
The more complex your intranet, the more involved your planning
will be. The plans for a small intranet could be very basic, a
list of steps with deadlines for completion of each step written
down in a notepad. The plans for a large intranet could be rendered
in detail using a project management tool such as Microsoft Project.
<P>
Ideally, your deadlines will not be carved in stone. The best
planners use windows for project steps, such as five days for
planning or two weeks for preliminary design. There could be hundreds
of steps, with multiple steps being performed simultaneously or
a handful of steps with each step being performed one after the
other. Some steps would be dependent on other steps, meaning they
could not be started until certain other aspects of the intranet
were completed. Other steps would not be dependent on any other
steps and could be performed at any time during the intranet's
development.<BR>
<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDERCOLOR=#000000 BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Part of your planning should include scheduling necessary training on the intranet and promoting the intranet to company employees. If you don't sell the employees-your customers-on the intranet, your intranet will not succeed.<BR>
One way to help sell the intranet is to develop focus groups. Using the focus groups, you can get your customers involved with the development process. Continued involvement in the intranet throughout its development and after its implementation ensures 
you create an intranet the customers want. It also ensures they have a solid investment in an intranet that they will want to promote and support.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Step3Design">Step 3: Design</A></H3>
<P>
The design step is one of the most critical steps. During this
step you take your plans to another level of detail. You do this
by determining how and where the intranet's hardware and software
will be set up. For example, will the intranet's main Web server
be located in the computer department or how will the software
be distributed?
<P>
Use this step as a reminder to sit down with your system administrators
and network personnel. You should discuss how you plan to install
the hardware and software for the intranet. If there are any misgivings
about the intranet, it is better to hear about them before you
begin installation. If there are great ideas for improving the
planned intranet, you definitely want to consider them before
installation.<BR>

For a small intranet, you might be inclined to skip this step altogether. Don't. During this step, you might discover something you overlooked in planning.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Part of your design might be to use a specific section of the
current network as a test bed before you deploy the intranet company-wide.
In this way, you install the intranet services within a specific
department or office. The users in this group are then given access
to the intranet for a testing period. Based on the outcome of
the testing, you would either continue with the company-wide installation
of the intranet or revise your plans accordingly.
<P>
Ideally, your intranet team will work closely with the test group.
During installation, and when users start using the new services,
you should ensure someone is on hand to answer questions and problems
that might arise. This individual or group from your intranet
team should take notes and make daily progress reports. Based
on the input, you could modify your plans as you proceed through
the various phases of the implementation for the test group.
<H3><A NAME="Step4Implementation">Step 4: Implementation</A></H3>
<P>
The implementation step tends to be the longest step in the development
of your intranet. During this step, you install your intranet
services and create your intranet applications based on the requirements,
plans, and designs you created.<BR>

Learning the building blocks for creating a perfect intranet is
only the first step toward implementing your intranet. Your intranet
will need content, which can be organized in a variety of styles
and created with a variety of helper applications. You will also
need to set up basic networking protocols, like TCP/IP, and services
like the WWW. Once you have selected the basic tools you need
to create the intranet and considered how you will organize it,
you can map it through completion.
