</H2>
<P>
As a programmer, you know a program is never complete. It is a
rare occasion when you can walk away from an application saying,
&quot;That's it! I can add nothing else!&quot; It is a very rare
occasion indeed. Well, the software in this book is no different.
There is always room for improvement.
<P>
In any case, this chapter will cover a few areas where you might
be able to extend the Java Intranet Framework to get even more
use from it. Some of these ideas came to me during the writing
of this book, others I purposely left out for you, the reader/programmer,
to create yourself. What fun is it if I do everything?
<P>
Take a look back at each of the separate packages and go over
some of the ideas for extending those classes.
<H2><A NAME="jifutil"><TT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000 FACE="Courier">jif.util</TT></FONT></A>
</H2>
<P>
The <TT>jif.util</TT> package contains
several utility classes. They are created for demonstration purposes
and for use in the applications in this book. Of all those classes,
only the <TT>FileDate</TT> and <TT>ConfigProperties</TT>
classes have room for extension.
<P>
The timers can be extended; however, you would be pushing the
functionality beyond a simple timer. They should be used within
classes rather than be subclassed. However, it is always the case
that classes developed by one person are used by another in a
manner that the author never thought of.
<H3><A NAME="ConfigProperties"><TT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Courier">ConfigProperties</TT></FONT></A>
</H3>
<P>
Although this class is quite useful, it does do one specific thing.
If it finds a property called <TT>jdbc.drivers</TT>
in your property table, it adds it to the system property table.
This mechanism is very specific. It only looks for that single
property.
<P>
An excellent enhancement to the <TT>ConfigProperties</TT>
class would be to make this mechanism more configurable. This
means that you would be able to tell the class which properties
would be merged with the system property table. The class could
then keep an array of these properties and deal with them at runtime.
<P>
Another thing that you could do is make the <TT>ConfigProperties</TT>
class merge all of the private properties with the system property
table. Then the overridden <TT>getProperty()</TT>
method could call the <TT>System.getProperty()</TT>
method directly.
<H3><A NAME="FileDate"><TT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Courier">FileDate</TT></FONT></A>
</H3>
<P>
This class went through many changes over the course of writing
this book. It went from having only a single purpose to having
many. Although not perfect, this final version of <TT>FileDate</TT>
is quite versatile.
<P>
One idea for extending this class is to create a more user-friendly
date formatter, perhaps one that is not tied to constants. This
formatter would possibly accept as input a string representing
the format that you would like your date returned. This format
string could use simple MM-DD-YY strings.
<H2><A NAME="jiflog"><TT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000 FACE="Courier">jif.log</TT></FONT></A>
</H2>
<P>
The logging classes presented in this book are quite simple. They
write a static format out to the log. These classes could easily
be rearranged and extended to provide a much more robust logging
system.
<P>
One example is to abstract the formatting of the log entry out
to a separate class. Make it a stream class like some of the Java
classes. This class would be the only one that knows how to format
log entries. You could then create output classes that plug in
to the formatter class. This is probably a far more object-oriented
approach than the one taken in this book.
<P>
If you did do this, you could then make the formatter configurable
as well. Instead of always putting out the same information, let
the consumer or user of the object specify in what fields, and
in what order, they are written to the log. This would give you
a robust and configurable logging system.
<H2><A NAME="jifsql"><TT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000 FACE="Courier">jif.sql</TT></FONT></A>
</H2>
<P>
The classes in this package represent database communications.
These classes are very useful. However, with a little work, you
might not have to code much anymore.
<P>
The next logical step for the classes in this package is for them
to automatically query the database. This query would retrieve
the table structures from the database. The classes could then
dynamically construct themselves to mimic each table. This is
pretty extreme, but definitely possible.
<P>
Another, more likely extension, is to create a class that represents
a window into a table. This window would allow the programmer
to specify the SQL statement that loads data. This information
is then available to be put through a user interface. The class
could then maintain a cursor, or pointer, as to which record is
current, and automatically scroll through the data using the same
user interface.
<P>
Then, once changes have been made, all the SQL would be generated
to update all the data changes that were made.
<H2><A NAME="jifawt"><TT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000 FACE="Courier">jif.awt</TT></FONT></A>
</H2>
<P>
Being the largest package in this book, the <TT>jif.awt</TT>
class has many areas where it can be extended. Take a look at
some of them:
<H3><A NAME="JifPanel"><TT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Courier">JifPanel</TT></FONT></A>
</H3>
<P>
Currently, the <TT>JifPanel</TT> is
static in size. One extension could be to make it more dynamic
and let it grow with its surroundings. If a resized window contains
a <TT>JifPanel</TT>, the <TT>JifPanel</TT>
might want to grow with the window. Getting this to work with
hard-coded sizes, though, might present a programming challenge.
<P>
Also, the <TT>JifPanel</TT> currently
draws its three-dimensional frames in the old Microsoft Windows
v3.x style. Another extension could be to upgrade to the newer
Microsoft Windows 95/NT look. This 3-D look is cleaner and more
modern-looking. It is used in the <TT>JifTabPanel</TT>.
<H3><A NAME="JifTabPanel"><TT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Courier">JifTabPanel</TT></FONT></A>
</H3>
<P>
The <TT>JifTabPanel</TT> is one of
the more complex classes in the <TT>jif.awt</TT>
package. It consists of two subclasses that do its bidding, but
it is far from perfect. The following are some ideas for enhancing
the <TT>JifTabPanel</TT>.
<P>
Currently there is no way to disable a tab. You could add the
functionality to enable and disable tabs in the panel, but this
would restrict users from looking at data on that pane if it wasn't
visible.
<P>
The <TT>JifTabPanel</TT> has two operating
modes. In the first mode, the entire width of the bounding rectangle
is used for tab space. This means that if there are two tabs,
the width of each tab is relative to the width of the parent container.
<P>
In the second mode, the tab width is relative to the width of
the text string that is displayed by the tab. This is the default
mode.
<P>
However, if more tabs exist than can be shown, they are cut off.
An excellent enhancement to this class would be one that places
a set of buttons at the end of the tab panel to move backwards
and forwards. This would avoid the loss of tabs and scroll the
entire tab portion so the user can see what lies behind. This
effect can be seen in several Microsoft Windows products today.
<P>
Another enhancement would be to let the programmer/user specify
the font. Currently the fonts are hard-coded to be dialog-style
fonts. Perhaps someone would like other fonts.
<P>
This class is far from perfect, but it can be extended to be an
awesome class.
<H3><A NAME="StatusBar"><TT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Courier">StatusBar</TT></FONT></A>
</H3>
<P>
This class could be extended to allow the programmer/user to select
the font and style of the border. This information is currently
hard-coded in the <TT>StatusBar</TT>
class.
<H3><A NAME="Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</A></H3>
<P>
There are only a handful of Java components that have been enhanced
to generate SQL. This is an obvious area of extension.
<P>
One good choice for extending in this regard is the <TT>Choice</TT>
class. It could be made to generate SQL for you. In addition,
you could create an extension that would act like a code table.
It would display descriptive text while returning a code from
the selection. This is a very useful feature.
<H2><A NAME="jifjiflet"><TT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000 FACE="Courier">jif.jiflet</TT></FONT></A>
</H2>
<P>
Although complex, and the user of many classes, the <TT>Jiflet</TT>
class really offers no areas for extension. There is one possible
enhancement that could be made.
<P>
You might want to enhance the <TT>Jiflet</TT>
class to descend from a <TT>Thread</TT>.
This would make the main jiflet run as a thread. You could then
stop and start it at will. It might come in handy sometime.
<P>
You also might explore the possibility of extending the jiflet
to work as an applet instead of as an application.
<H2><A NAME="ExtendingtheApplications"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Extending
the Applications</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
The applications in this book, though useful, are not all perfect.
This section will detail some areas where they could be spruced
up by you.
<P>
Currently, all the applications require the <TT>DBConnector</TT>
to be created for them. You could enhance the core <TT>Jiflet</TT>
class to build a <TT>DBConnector</TT>
based on a configuration property. This would allow you to change
databases on-the-fly with a configuration file change, instead
of a source code change. This would eliminate the need for recompilation
as well.
<P>
In addition, each of the applications require you to manually
connect with the database. This could be made automatic at startup.
Then the user would not be required to perform this action.
<P>
Take a look at some specific enhancements.
<H3><A NAME="BenefitsMaintenance">Benefits Maintenance</A></H3>
<P>
This application can be expanded to do much more. Currently, it
only manages the lowest common denominator. Many retirement plans
today allow you to change your investments in different areas.
This is not represented at all by your maintenance program.
<P>
This would, however, make an awesome enhancement. Allow the user
to choose the fund and percentage of his money that would go into
that fund. You would need a separate table to hold the new information,
but the usefulness of the application would jump tenfold. This
information could then be sent electronically to the benefits
administrator, or even directly to the benefits company.
<H3><A NAME="ConferenceRoomScheduling">Conference Room Scheduling</A>
</H3>
<P>
One of the features of this program was left for the reader to
complete: the delete function. You currently cannot remove a previously
scheduled conference room. This is a good place to jump in and
get your feet wet.
<P>
In addition, there is no program for creating conference rooms.
They must be entered through a database manipulation tool, or
a program needs to be created. This is a great small jiflet. You
can model it after the Employee Files application.
<H3><A NAME="NewsandAnnouncements">News and Announcements</A>
</H3>
<P>
This application lets you enter News and Announcements, but there
is no way to delete them. A likely addition to this program would
let you delete news items that are of a certain age, or perhaps
not show them.
<P>
Also, there is no refresh in this application. A good extension
would be to program in an automatic timed refresh like the one
in the Online In/Out Board.
<H2><A NAME="Summary"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Summary</FONT></A>
</H2>
<P>
This chapter recapped some of the areas where the Java Intranet
Framework could be enhanced to provide more flexibility and functionality.
I covered each package individually and noted areas of improvement.
I also looked at areas of improvement in the sample applications.
<P>
This brings you to the end of the book. I hope you have enjoyed
reading it. I also hope you have learned how you can use Java
to develop some killer intranet applications for your company
or customers. Please feel free to e-mail me your comments, suggestions,
gripes, and so on. My e-mail address is listed in the front of
the book. I would love to hear what you think about Java and intranets.
