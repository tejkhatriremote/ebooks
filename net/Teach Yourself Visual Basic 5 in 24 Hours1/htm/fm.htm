<P>Sams Publishing makes the best books possible. The reason is solely that it has
good people, who shine above all the rest. The author-editor relationship is often
a distant one, but I am so very grateful that the people at Sams shorten that distance.
The editors are my friends and I'm glad.</P>
<P>Fran Hatton and Kitty Jarrett have gone above and beyond their calls of duty.
This book is good because of them, not me. In addition, Dean Miller deserves my thanks
over and over because of the jobs he passes along to me.</P>
<P>My technical editor, Robert Wasserman, had quite a job when he took on this project.
My writing makes any technical editing challenging, but Robert stayed on the ball
the entire book. Other editors and staff at Sams who produced this book are also
responsible for this book's excellence, and I alone am responsible for any problems
if there are any.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Bob and Cheryl Enyart continue to improve my life with our friendship.
Rarely can one have friends who challenge, teach, and love as much as the Enyarts,
and I'm so very grateful for them in my life.</P>
<P>My lovely and gracious bride, Jayne, keeps smiling, waiting, and supporting while
I bury my head in a project. As always, thank you, my lovely one. My thanks also
go to Dad and Mom, Glen and Bettye Perry, who are my biggest fans. I love you all.</P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="Heading8"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Introduction</FONT></H2>
<P>You probably are anxious to get started with your 24-hour Visual Basic course.
Take just a few preliminary moments to acquaint yourself with the design of this
book, which is described in the next few sections.
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="Heading9"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Who Should Read This
Book</FONT></H3>
<P>This book is for programmers and would-be programmers who want to learn Visual
Basic as quickly as possible without sacrificing the foundation necessary to master
the language. Visual Basic is a product one can use at many levels. Newcomers who
have never programmed can create a complete working Windows program in less than
two hours, as this book demonstrates. Those who have programmed in other languages
will appreciate Visual Basic's design, which makes creating a Windows program more
like designing a screen with a mouse-driven art program.</P>
<P>This book teaches Visual Basic in several levels. You will quickly begin creating
applications by following simple examples. These applications will be fully working
Windows applications with all the usual user-interface controls such as command buttons,
labels, and text boxes.</P>
<P>Once you become familiar with building the program's user interface, you can start
honing your programming skills by learning the actual Visual Basic programming language.
Fortunately, learning Visual Basic's programming language is much easier than learning
others, such as C++.</P>
<P>As long as you are familiar with Windows, you can create applications with Visual
Basic. You don't have to be a Windows expert, but you should feel comfortable working
with menus, the mouse, and the Windows interface. If you've opened, closed, and resized
windows, you surely have the skills necessary to create your own Visual Basic applications.</P>
<P>This 24-hour course teaches Visual Basic 5, the latest and greatest Visual Basic
incarnation. Visual Basic 5 requires Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0. The Windows 95
interface introduced in Windows 95 and that now appears in NT makes working within
a windowed environment enjoyable.
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="Heading10"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">What This Book Will
Do for You</FONT></H3>
<P>Although this is not a reference book, you'll learn virtually everything a beginning
and intermediate Visual Basic programmer needs to know to create usable, powerful,
and fun applications with Visual Basic. There are many advanced technical details
that most programmers will never need, but this book does not waste your time with
them. I know that you want to get up-to-speed with Visual Basic in 24 hours, and
this book fulfills this goal without sacrificing the quality of your skill set.</P>
<P>This book presents both the background and the theory that a new Visual Basic
programmer needs. In addition to the background discussions, this book is practical
and provides tons of step-by-step tasks that you work through to create Visual Basic
applications. The tasks start simple and then add details as you move from hour to
hour.
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="Heading11"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Can This Book Really
Teach Visual Basic in 24 Hours?</FONT></H3>
<P>Yes. You can master each chapter in one hour or less (by the way, chapters are
referred to as &quot;lessons&quot; or &quot;hours&quot; in the rest of the book).
Although some lessons are longer than others, the material is balanced. The longer
chapters contain several tasks, and the shorter chapters contain background material.
The balance provided by the tasks, background, and insightful explanations and tips
makes learning Visual Basic using this book fresh at every page.
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="Heading12"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">What You Need</FONT></H3>
<P>This book assumes that you have a Windows 95-compatible computer with Windows
95 installed. In addition, you need Visual Basic 5.0 installed. As long as you have
the hardware to install both Windows 95 and Visual Basic 5, you have everything you
need to use this book and to learn Visual Basic programming.
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="Heading13"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Conventions Used
in This Book</FONT></H3>
<P>The lessons highlight new terms as they appear. There is a question-and-answer
section at the end of each lesson to reinforce ideas. In addition, the lessons reinforce
your learning further with quiz questions and exercises.</P>
<P>This 24-hour course also uses several common conventions to help teach the programming
topics. Here is a summary of the typographical conventions:

<UL>
	<LI>The first time a new term appears, you'll find a New Term definition to help
	reinforce that term.
	<P>
	<LI>Commands and computer output appear in a special <TT>monospaced</TT> computer
	font.
	<P>
	<LI>Words you type appear in a boldfaced computer font.
	<P>
	<LI>If a task requires you to select from a menu, the book separates menu commands
	with a vertical bar. Therefore, this book uses File | Save As to select the Save
	As command from the File menu.
	<P>
	<LI>When learning a programming language, you often need to learn the syntax or format
	of a command. Often you will see lines such as the following when learning a new
	Visual Basic language command:
</UL>



<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<PRE><FONT COLOR="#0066FF">For CounterVar = StartVal To EndVal [Step IncrementVal]
   Block of one or more
      Visual Basic statements
Next CounterVar</FONT></PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#0066FF"></FONT></PRE>

<UL>
	<LI>The monospace text designates code (programming language information) that you'll
	enter into a program. The regular monospace text such as <TT>For</TT> and <TT>Next</TT>
	represent keywords you must type exactly. Italicized<TT> </TT>monospace characters
	indicate placeholders that you must replace with your own program's values. Bracketed
	information, such as <TT>[Step </TT>IncrementVal<TT>]</TT> indicates optional code
	that you can type if your program requires it.
</UL>

<P>In addition to typographical conventions, the following special elements are included
to set off different types of information to make them easily recognizable:
